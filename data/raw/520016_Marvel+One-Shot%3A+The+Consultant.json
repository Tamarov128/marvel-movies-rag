As they see him as a war hero, and blame his fight in New York City with Hulk on [[Bruce Banner (Earth-199999)|Banner]] himself. They order S.H.I.E.L.D. to send an agent to ask General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross to release Blonsky into their custody. The two agents decide to send a patsy to sabotage the meeting, so Ross will refuse to release Blonsky.\n\nAt Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends the Consultant: Tony Stark. A disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who ends up annoying Ross so much that Ross tries to have him removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar, and schedules it for demolition. The next day at the restaurant, Sitwell arrives to Coulson eating breakfast. Coulson informs him that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.\n\n| Cast                    = [[File:Consultant ad.jpg|thumb]]\n* [[wikipedia:Clark Gregg|Clark Gregg]] as [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-199999)|Phil Coulson]]\n* Maximiliano Hernández as [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-199999)|Jasper Sitwell]]\n* [[wikipedia:Robert Downey, Jr.|Robert Downey, Jr.]] as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Tony Stark]]\n* [[wikipedia:William Hurt|William Hurt]] as [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-199999)|General Ross]]\n* [[wikipedia:Tim Roth|Tim Roth]] as [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-199999)|Abomination]]\n\nThe characters of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Tony Stark]], [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-199999)|General Ross]] and the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-199999)|Abomination]] appear respectively in footage recycled from ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.\n\n| Notes                   = <gallery>\nThe Consultant|Dailymotion video\n</gallery>\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Marvel One-Shots|Marvel Films]]\n}}\n[[Category:Short Films]]\n[[Category:Marvel One-Shots]]"
