This leads to a civil war on planet Hala, the Kree home world, rendering the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight over the next 30 years.\nThe Kree's new leader Dar-Benn discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands, which were previously used to create a network that allows fast travel across space. She uses the Band to forcibly open a new jump point that connects to the network. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new one that Dar-Benn opened. \nWhen they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers's location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth, and is a huge fan of Danvers—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers (Danvers: energy projection; Rambeau: energy absorption; Kamala: hard light), and the Khan family use instruments such as mops, to fight off Kree enemies, leaving the home destroyed.\nAfter the trio return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously. They join up at a Skrull refugee colony on planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. \nAfter a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names \"the Marvels\". Danvers explains that Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability in the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, whom Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala, she calling Danvers \"The Annihilator\".\nThe Marvels reach the water planet Aladna, where people communicate in song, and warn Danvers' husband, Prince Yan, before Dar-Benn arrives and tears open a jump point, drawing the planet's water to Hala. Her final plan is to seize the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala's sun. The Marvels battle Dar-Benn and defeat her, but when Danvers lifts a wall off her, Dar-Benn seizes back her weapon and threatens Kamala, forcing Danvers to stand down. Dar-Benn steals Kamala's Band and attempts to use both Bands, but this destroys Dar-Benn, ends the Marvels' entanglement, and leaves behind a rupture between realities. \nKamala reclaims the Bands and joins Danvers to energize Rambeau, allowing her to close the hole from the other side, but stranding her in the process, though Danvers tried to rescue her. Kamala returns to Earth, along with her family, who had to flee the space station with Fury, and a litter of Flerkens who temporarily swallowed the station's crew to make up for the lack of escape pods. Danvers flies into Hala's sun, using her power to restore it, as she had promised Dar-Benn. Back on Earth, after the Khan family prepares to move into Rambeau's house, Kamala asks to fly in a nearby small plane with Danvers, but the latter says they'll wait for Rambeau before flying it.\nThe short-lived team-up inspires Kamala to seek out other young heroes and form a new group, starting with Kate Bishop. In a mid-credits scene, Rambeau awakes in a parallel universe where she is greeted by Binary—an alternate version of her mother Maria—and the mutant scientist Hank McCoy, who explains the confused Rambeau may be in a different reality.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Brie Larson}} as [[Carol Danvers (Earth-199999)|Captain Marvel / Carol Danvers]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Shareholder|url= https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/captain-marvel-2-ms-marvel-nia-dacosta|title= ‘Captain Marvel 2’ Flies Higher, Further, Faster with Director Nia DaCosta|work= Marvel.com|last= Paige|first= Rachel|date= December 10, 2020|accessdate= December 11, 2020}}\n\n* [[Iman Vellani]] as [[Kamala Khan (Earth-199999)|Ms. Marvel / Kamala Khan]]<ref name=\"Shareholder\"/>\n\n* {{WP|Teyonah Parris}} as [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-199999)|Monica Rambeau]]<ref name=\"Shareholder\"/>\n\n* {{WP|Samuel L.
