An innovator responsible for creating much of Wakanda's modern technology, she is also known for designing the current generation \nPanther Habits\n. Following her brother's \ncoronation\n, Shuri assisted him and the \nDora Milaje\n in tracking down \nUlysses Klaue\n, only to be forced to flee the \nGolden City\n as \nErik Killmonger\n overthrew the throne, eventually returning to reclaim Wakanda. Shortly after, Shuri succeeded in eliminating the \nHYDRA\n programming from \nBucky Barnes\n' mind. \nTwo years later\n, she was tasked by her brother and the \nAvengers\n in removing the \nMind Stone\n from \nVision\n's head, as the android was under threat from \nThanos\n. She was soon compromised and defeated by \nCorvus Glaive\n. Shortly after, she was among the many who died when Thanos completed the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n and \nwiped out\n half of all life in the universe. She was \nresurrected\n by \nHulk\n \nfive years later\n, where she participated in the \nfinal battle\n against \nThanos\n.\nHeartbroken by \nT'Challa\n's sudden death, Shuri had to face the threat of \nNamor\n and the \nTalokanil\n who wanted to wage war on the surface world and protect their \nhome\n. As Shuri was trying to save \nRiri Williams\n, Namor proposed her a military alliance but in the end, the Talokanil declared \nwar\n on \nWakanda\n, leading to Namor killing \nRamonda\n. Devastated, Shuri yearned for vengeance and managed to synthesize a \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n, taking on the mantle of \nBlack Panther\n. Shuri led the Wakandan army in the \ngrand battle against Namor\n, during which she managed to defeat Namor but decided to spare his life. When the war ended, Shuri decided to leave Wakanda and the throne to \nM'Baku\n unchallenged, and stayed in \nHaiti\n, where \nNakia\n introduced Shuri to her nephew, \nT'Challa II\n.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nBuilding Technologies\n1.2\n \nT'Challa's Rule\n1.2.1\n \nThe Return of T'Challa\n1.2.2\n \nCoronation of T'Challa\n1.2.3\n \nMission in Busan\n1.2.4\n \nHealing Everett Ross\n1.2.5\n \nKillmonger's Takeover\n1.2.6\n \nBattle of Mount Bashenga\n1.2.7\n \nSharing Resources\n1.2.8\n \nHelping Bucky Barnes\n1.3\n \nInfinity War\n1.3.1\n \nExtracting the Mind Stone\n1.4\n \nRestored To Life\n1.4.1\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.4.2\n \nReunion in Wakanda\n1.4.3\n \nTony Starks Funeral\n1.4.4\n \nThe Wakanda Files\n1.4.5\n \nTeaching Assata\n1.5\n \nLosing Her Brother\n1.5.1\n \nAttempts to Recreate the Herb\n1.5.2\n \nT'Challa's Funeral\n1.6\n \nVisiting Assata\n1.7\n \nTalokanil-Wakandan War\n1.7.1\n \nMeeting Namor\n1.7.2\n \nMeeting Riri Williams\n1.7.3\n \nChase in Cambridge\n1.7.4\n \nTaken to Talokan\n1.7.5\n \nThe Last of Royal Blood\n1.7.6\n \nRamonda's Funeral\n1.8\n \nBecoming Black Panther\n1.8.1\n \nTaking the Herb\n1.8.2\n \nWanting Vengeance\n1.8.3\n \nEnding the Conflict\n1.9\n \nLeaving Wakanda\n1.9.1\n \nMeeting Her Nephew\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nPanther Habit\n4.2\n \nWeapons\n4.3\n \nOther Equipment\n4.4\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nDesigns\n6\n \nFacilities\n6.1\n \nPrisons\n7\n \nRelationships\n7.1\n \nFamily\n7.2\n \nAllies\n7.3\n \nEnemies\n8\n \nAppearances\n9\n \nTrivia\n10\n \nBehind the Scenes\n11\n \nReferences\n12\n \nExternal Links\nBiography\n[\n]\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nBuilding Technologies\n[\n]\n\"\nWe\n have watched with disgust as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child who scoffs at tradition.\"\n\nM'Baku\n[src]\nShuri was born in the late \n1990s\n to King \nT'Chaka\n and his wife, Queen \nRamonda\n, members of the \nGolden Tribe\n of \nWakanda\n.\n[\n1\n]\n Ramonda raised Shuri and her brother, \nT'Challa\n, to love Wakanda, its people, and its legacy.\n[\n9\n]\n At younger than ten years old, Shuri was accepted into \nWakanda University\n. By the time she was thirteen years old, the university gave her the position of assistant professor.\n[\n10\n]\n Due to her genius-level intellect and incredible engineering skills, Shuri led the \nWakandan Design Group\n, creating much of Wakanda's modern technology, like \nWakandan Maglev Train\n.\n[\n1\n]\n She advanced assistive technologies for disabled people, such as wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters.\n[\n10\n]\nT'Challa's Rule\n[\n]\nThe Return of T'Challa\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \nShuri greets \nT'Challa\n upon his arrival\n \n \nIn \n2016\n, along with Ramonda, Shuri greeted \nT'Challa\n when he returned to \nWakanda\n from a \nmission\n to bring \nNakia\n back to Wakanda as well. Shuri asked \nOkoye\n whether T'Challa had frozen when he encountered Nakia and laughed when Okoye confirmed. She then told T'Challa that she wanted to improve his \nEMP Beads\n, although he insisted that they were fully functional. Shuri then left T'Challa with Ramonda, not without a last obscene gesture towards her brother when he mocked her about her ceremony clothes, which was swiftly reprimanded by her mother.\n[\n1\n]\nCoronation of T'Challa\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri watches the duel between \nT'Challa\n and \nM'Baku\n \n \n\"Is there any member of royal blood who wishes to challenge for the throne?\"\n\"This corset is really uncomfortable, so could we all just wrap it up and go home?\"\n\nZuri\n and Shuri\n[src]\nShuri then joined the ceremony for the \nCoronation of T'Challa\n, dancing with her mother on the \nGolden Tribe\n boat. They arrived on the \nWarrior Falls\n for the ceremony and Shuri watched as \nZuri\n prepared to make T'Challa the new King of Wakanda. When Zuri asked whether a member of the royal family wished to challenge for the throne, Shuri jokingly raised her hand, amused by the audience's confusion until she announced that she only wanted to be over with the ceremony so that she could change out of her uncomfortable clothes. However, the ceremony was disturbed by the arrival of the \nJabari Tribe\n, as \nM'Baku\n wanted to challenge T'Challa. Shuri attended the duel between T'Challa and M'Baku, strongly encouraging her brother as he had some trouble defeating his opponent. Eventually, T'Challa triumphed over M'Baku, causing Shuri to cheer with the rest of the public.\n[\n1\n]\nMission in Busan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri greets \nT'Challa\n at the \nlab\n \n \n\"Yes! Wait, which side of the road is it?\"\n\"For \nBast\n's sake, just drive!\"\nShuri and \nBlack Panther\n[src]\nShortly before \nT'Challa\n went to \nSouth Korea\n with \nOkoye\n and \nNakia\n to arrest the criminal \nUlysses Klaue\n, Shuri brought him to her \nlab\n to showcase new equipment she had developed for him, including \nsound-nullififying boots\n She also told him to bring the \nRemote Access Kimoyo Beads\n so that she could assist in the capture of Klaue, as she could provide backup for the mission if required and notified she already sent a car to \nBusan\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri shows \nT'Challa\n the upgraded \nPanther Habit\n \n \nShuri proceeded to demonstrate the new upgraded version of \nPanther Habit\n which were even more reliable than his original design. She further explained that the upgraded versions are made of nanotechnology and can be fit in a necklace. Shuri then asked her brother to kick the suit which he proceeded to do so. After placing it back she explained to him that the suit can absorb kinetic energy and redistribute it. Shuri asked him to strike the suit in the same spot and readied her camera, innocently claiming it is for research. As T'Challa kicked it he was knocked out by an impact of kinetic energy a scene which Shuri enjoyed. Shuri was then immediately ordered to delete the video by an embarrassed T'Challa.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri helps to chase \nUlysses Klaue\n \n \nShuri was indeed called for assistance by T'Challa, much to her enthusiasm, as Klaue attempted to escape from the Wakandans. Using the Remote Access Kimoyo Beads, Shuri remotely drove a car which Black Panther stood on to chase Klaue in the streets of \nBusan\n. Shuri warned her brother that they would hit other cars, but Black Panther managed to redirect the car, enabling Shuri to keep driving. Together, T'Challa and Shuri managed to take down several of Klaue's bodyguards, with Shuri even driving over one even if she was not fully aware of what went under her car. As they caught up on another of Klaue's bodyguard's SUV, Shuri told T'Challa to use the kinetic energy stored in his Panther Habit to damage their car and mocked him for showing off when he successfully did it. Shuri eventually found Klaue's car and chased him but Klaue used the cannon on his \nprosthetic arm\n, which destroyed the Shuri's car. As a result, the hologram Shuri used in her lab was ended, keeping her from further assisting T'Challa.\n[\n1\n]\n She later got a message from the Department of Defense warning her not to use her technology in public. They explained that much of the public just witnessed her inventions.\n[\n11\n]\nHealing Everett Ross\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri remarks \nEverett Ross\n' as another patient\n \n \n\"Great! Another \nbroken white boy\n for us to fix. This is going to be fun.\"\nShuri\n[src]\nShuri welcomed \nT'Challa\n, \nNakia\n and \nOkoye\n in her \nlab\n when they returned to \nWakanda\n. As they had taken with them a heavily wounded \nEverett Ross\n, Shuri expressed her enthusiasm at the idea of helping another American, due to the fact that she had already been asked to look after \nBucky Barnes\n. Shuri assured her partners that Ross would survive and proceeded on the surgery. Thanks to the \nVibranium\n technology, she successfully healed Ross.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri designs \nVibranium Gauntlets\n for herself\n \n \nWhile waiting for Ross to regain consciousness, Shuri worked on her \nVibranium Gauntlets\n. She was scared when Ross, who had woken up, asked her where they were, to which Shuri jokingly replied that they were in \nKansas\n. Shuri then explained that she had healed Ross overnight and instructed him to wait for T'Challa's return. While waiting for him, Shuri revealed to Ross that Wakanda heavily relied on Vibranium technology, which she had used to heal him.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri learns of \nErik Killmonger\n's history\n \n \nShuri was then called by Okoye, who looked for T'Challa. Shuri answered that she did not know where her brother was. She was then informed about the arrival of an \nunidentified Wakandan\n who claimed to have killed \nUlysses Klaue\n and was on his way to the \nCitadel\n.\n[\n1\n]\nKillmonger's Takeover\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri speaking with \nErik Killmonger\n \n \n\"Ask who I am.\"\n\"You're Erik Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are.\"\n\"That's not my name, Princess.\"\n\nErik Killmonger\n and Shuri\n[src]\nShuri received a picture of the stranger, who \nEverett Ross\n claimed was not \nWakandan\n, but instead an \nAmerican\n operative. Knowing that something was not right, Shuri managed to contact \nT'Challa\n and instructed him to come back to the \nlab\n. As T'Challa and \nNakia\n joined, Shuri listened to Ross' explanations about \nErik Killmonger\n and told his brother that although Killmonger had a \nWar Dogs\n tattoo, he did not appear in the Wakandan files.\nShuri joined the throne room where Killmonger was taken. As Killmonger repeatedly asked T'Challa to ask him his name and T'Challa refused, Shuri claimed that Killmonger was nothing more than an American mercenary. However, Killmonger replied that this was not his true name and, when asked by the \nRiver Tribe Elder\n, he disclosed his real identity: \nN'Jadaka\n, son of late Prince \nN'Jobu\n. Killmonger then called for a ritual duel against T'Challa to claim the throne of Wakanda.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri watches \nT'Challa\n get defeated\n \n \nShuri went to the \nWarrior Falls\n to attend the duel, remaining confident that T'Challa would prevail. However, she watched in anguish as Killmonger slowly gained the upper hand over T'Challa while Shuri tried to encourage her brother. In the end, Killmonger defeated T'Challa and murdered \nZuri\n, who intervened in the fight, before throwing T'Challa down the waterfall as Shuri and her mother \nRamonda\n screamed in horror. In order to ensure their safety, Nakia took Shuri and Ramonda with her so they could escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri arriving within the \nJabari Land\n \n \nShuri waited for Nakia's return with her mother. Nakia eventually came back with Ross but without \nOkoye\n, who had refused to accompany them. Together, Shuri, Nakia, Ramonda, and Ross decided to journey to \nJabari Land\n, where they intended to give the last \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n to \nM'Baku\n. On the way, they were captured by \nJabari Tribe\n who took them in front of M'Baku. When M'Baku noticed that T'Challa had been seemingly killed in ritual combat, Shuri told him not to deepen their pain, but he ordered her to remain silent.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri finding \nT'Challa\n alive on ice\n \n \nAs Nakia offered the Heart-Shaped Herb to M'Baku, he told Shuri and the others to follow him and took them to see an unconscious T'Challa, who had been saved by a Jabari fisherman and covered in snow to prevent him from dying. Shuri suggested to bring T'Challa back to her \nlab\n, but M'Baku advised her against it as T'Challa would die in seconds. Thus, under Ramonda's guidance, Shuri and Nakia performed a ritual using the Heart-Shaped Herb to successfully revive T'Challa.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri decides to fight beside \nT'Challa\n \n \nShuri and the others went back to the Jabari throne room. Shuri figured out that Killmonger would seize all of her designs and share \nVibranium\n weapons with the rest of the world, which they could not allow. Although T'Challa suggested having Shuri and Ramonda leave Wakanda for their safety, they insisted on staying. Shuri then revealed she had kept the necklace with T'Challa's \nPanther Habit\n and gave it to his brother, claiming that she would fight alongside the \nBlack Panther\n. Shuri then left T'Challa as he wanted to speak privately with M'Baku and prepared her to return to the Golden City.\n[\n1\n]\nBattle of Mount Bashenga\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri and \nNakia\n join the \nBattle of Mount Bashenga\n \n \n\"What's up, Princess?\"\n\"You'll never be a true King.\"\n\nErik Killmonger\n and Shuri\n[src]\nShuri, \nNakia\n and \nEverett Ross\n sneaked in \nShuri's Lab\n while \nT'Challa\n confronted \nErik Killmonger\n on \nMount Bashenga\n. There, Shuri reclaimed her \nVibranium Gauntlets\n and told Nakia to wear a \nDora Milaje\n armor. She also gave \nRemote Access Kimoyo Beads\n to Ross, instructing him to remain in the lab and be ready to fly the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n to destroy the weapons cargos sent by Killmonger. Shuri then left the lab with Nakia to join the battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri fighting against \nErik Killmonger\n \n \nShuri and Nakia arrived on top of Mount Bashenga. They knocked over two \nWakandan Royal Guards\n who were guarding the Royal Talon Fighter and successfully gave Ross remote access to it, enabling him to fly it away. They then watched as several members of the Dora Milaje, including \nOkoye\n, were defeated by Killmonger. Shuri and Nakia attacked him, and thanks to their combined efforts, they were able to briefly subdue him.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri aids \nT'Challa\n \n \nDespite that, Killmonger proved to be too much of a challenge for them. He damaged Shuri's gauntlets, rendering them useless, and pinned down Shuri on the ground. Expecting to be killed, Shuri told Killmonger that he would never be a true King. However, Shuri was rescued by T'Challa, who threw himself and Killmonger down into the \nGreat Mound\n. When they landed, T'Challa ordered Shuri to activate the \nWakandan Maglev Train\n so the sonic stabilizers would disable Killmonger's \nPanther Habit\n, although Shuri warned him that this would affect T'Challa's suit the same way.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri looks over to \nOkoye\n and \nW'Kabi\n \n \nArmed with a \nSonic Spear\n, Shuri then rushed to a slightly wounded Nakia and they joined the battlefield, where the Dora Milaje fought against the \nBorder Tribe\n. Shuri, Nakia, Okoye and \nAyo\n were cornered by their opponents, only to be rescued by the unexpected arrival of the \nJabari Tribe\n, who broke the Border Tribe's formation. Shuri resumed the fight against the Border Tribe, who eventually surrendered. Meanwhile, T'Challa defeated Killmonger, enabling Shuri to safely remain in the Golden City.\n[\n1\n]\nSharing Resources\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri is offer a job to run a \nnew facility\n \n \n\"When you said you'd bring me to \nCalifornia\n for the first time, I thought you meant \nCoachella\n, or \nDisneyland\n.\"\nShuri to \nT'Challa\n[src]\nShuri was taken by her brother \nT'Challa\n to \nOakland\n. She asked him why they were here, expressing disappointment over this first view of \nCalifornia\n, and T'Challa told Shuri that they were in the place where their uncle \nN'Jobu\n, \nErik Killmonger\n's father, had been killed by their own father \nT'Chaka\n. As Shuri expressed relief at the idea that the building where the murder had been perpetrated would be torn down, T'Challa replied that he had bought it and that he would make it the first \nWakandan International Outreach Centre\n, appointing Shuri the head of the science and information exchange.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri approaches to her \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n \n \nAs Shuri asked her brother whether he was kidding, he brought the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n and disabled its cloaking, enabling children playing nearby to see it. Shuri approached the children who admired the ship, introduced herself and began her work of sharing innovative technology with the rest of the world.\n[\n1\n]\nHelping Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri speaks with \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"Good. Thank you.\"\n\"Come. Much more for you to learn.\"\nShuri and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nWhen \nT'Challa\n brought \nSteve Rogers\n and \nBucky Barnes\n to \nWakanda\n, he entrusted Barnes to Shuri so she could remove \nHYDRA\n's programming from Barnes' mind. At the lab, Shuri explained to T'Challa and Rogers that she was using the most sophisticated bio-scanners in Wakanda to create a digital representation of Barnes' mind, in which the process would be tested to avoid damaging it while attempting to remove his brainwashing.\nMonths later, Shuri brought T'Challa to give his brother an update on Barnes. Shuri explained to T'Challa that, since Barnes programming was mostly connected to trigger words, she would use an algorithm that would 'reset' Barnes so HYDRA's programming could be destroyed without removing his memories. Shuri then revealed that her algorithm could be used to improve the Wakandan's technology through artificial intelligence in a more effective way than \nUltron\n.\n[\n12\n]\nInfinity War\n[\n]\nExtracting the Mind Stone\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri talks to \nBruce Banner\n about \nVision\n \n \n\"The structure is polymorphic.\"\n\"Right. We had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.\"\n\"Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?\"\nShuri and \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nIn \nMay 2018\n, Shuri was tasked by her \nbrother\n to help the \nAvengers\n at the \nWakanda Medical Center\n. She witnessed when \nSteve Rogers\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n, \nBruce Banner\n, and \nWanda Maximoff\n brought \nVision\n to receive her help in taking out the \nMind Stone\n. Banner believed if the Stone was to be removed carefully, it could be possible for Vision to survive without it and for Maximoff to destroy it. Shuri told them she would need time in order to do so.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri getting the \nMind Stone\n out of \nVision\n \n \nWith the Avengers and the Wakandan military fighting the \nalien\n army, Shuri attempted to disconnect the Mind Stone from Vision under the protection of \nAyo\n and Maximoff. However, as Shuri was working on the Mind Stone, she was startled upon hearing \nsomething\n coming up from under the ground on the battlefield. The noise from it shook the lab. Shortly after this, Maximoff left her post to join the battle. \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri fighting \nCorvus Glaive\n \n \nWith her absence, \nCorvus Glaive\n, a member of the \nBlack Order\n, attacked the lab. While Ayo briefly held him off, Shuri managed to shut down her work and enable Vision to be active again. Firing her gauntlets at Glaive, Shuri was nonetheless quickly incapacitated and was unable to complete her work.\n[\n13\n]\n Shortly afterwards, the Mind Stone was claimed from Vision by Thanos, who completed his goal to erase half of all life in the universe, and as a result, Shuri \ndisintegrated into dust\n.\n[\n6\n]\nRestored To Life\n[\n]\nBattle of Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri, \nT'Challa\n, and \nOkoye\n join the \nbattle\n \n \n\"Yibambe!\n[\n14\n]\n\"\n\"Yibambe!\"\n\nBlack Panther\n and Shuri\n[src]\nFive years later\n, as a result of the \nBlip\n, Shuri was restored to life. She, along with \nT'Challa\n, the \nWakandans\n, and the restored \nAvengers\n, were contacted by the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n to help fight in the \nbattle\n against an \nalternate Thanos\n. She then suited up and walked alongside T'Challa and \nOkoye\n through a \nportal\n that transported them to the ruins of the \nAvengers Compound\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri helps \nCarol Danvers\n during the \nbattle\n \n \nShuri then stood alongside the assembled heroes, as \nSteve Rogers\n led the charge against the \nalien\n army. As the battle proceeded, Shuri fought with great skill using her \ngauntlets\n. When the \nNano Gauntlet\n was required to get to the \nQuantum Tunnel\n in the \nbrown van\n, Shuri assisted \nCarol Danvers\n in doing so.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri, \nRescue\n, and \nWasp\n attack \nThanos\n \n \nWhen alternate Thanos attempted to stop her and started to charge at Danvers, Shuri, \nPepper Potts\n, and \nHope van Dyne\n launched a coordinated blast at alternate Thanos, knocking him away. The battle was concluded when \nTony Stark\n obtained the Infinity Stones and wiped out alternate Thanos and his army. However, Stark died due to the power of the Stones.\n[\n6\n]\n All the Avengers and allies, including Shuri, showed their respect and kneeled before him.\n[\n15\n]\nReunion in Wakanda\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri and \nT'Challa\n reunite with their \nmother\n \n \nShuri and T'Challa then returned to \nWakanda\n to reunite with their \nmother\n and watched from the \nCitadel\n as celebrations took place in the \nGolden City\n.\n[\n6\n]\nTony Starks Funeral\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri attends \nTony Stark\n's funeral\n \n \nA few days later, despite not knowing him before the previous battle, Shuri would join \nT'Challa\n and \nOkoye\n, as they attended the funeral of \nTony Stark\n at Stark's \nhome\n. The three stood together, and watched as \nPepper Potts\n and \nMorgan Stark\n placed Stark's \nArc Reactor\n into a lake and watched it float away.\n[\n6\n]\nThe Wakanda Files\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri begins to study her files\n \n \n\"It appears new information was obtained during the \ngap\n in my existence.\"\nShuri\n[src]\nShuri returned \nhome\n to do research in her \nlab\n. Still recovering from the reality that she had missed five years of her life due to the \nSnap\n, she sought the need to compile files of important events for technological purposes. She tasked the \nWar Dogs\n to provide her with information throughout the years, particularly related to the \nAvengers\n. Once she received the files, she knew most of the events that were listed, but was surprised to learn about the new events that happened during the five years she was gone. She prepared her notes with a special ink that only people with \nKimoyo Beads\n could read. This way, her research was private. Additionally, she looked through the files pertaining to the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n, remarking at how \nNakia\n was able to obtain a sample before they were burned. However, she had found it very hard to study the one sample.\nShuri opened up files on Human Enhancements and wondered why they used Vita-Rays to turn \nSteve Rogers\n into a Super Soldier. She also wondered how \nHoward Stark\n obtained the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n that eventually got him killed. She used this as an opportunity to record her work on \nBucky Barnes\n as well as noting her thoughts on the horrible nature of scientists that would use mind control. After reading the work of \nMaya Hansen\n on \nExtremis\n, Shuri wanted to develop it the right way. She then moved on to the \nIron Man\n armors, using the specs to note improvements that she could make to the designs. She also noticed the weird connections of radiation with the \nInfinity Stones\n. When she got to files on the \nTime Heist\n, she grew very upset that she missed the event, seeing it as a tremendous opportunity to further her knowledge.\nThe next files pertained to weapons which contained information on the \nSokovia Accords\n. Shuri wondered if her \nfather\n was in the right for signing the accords despite it leading to his demise. When reading about \nMjlnir\n, Shuri continued to wonder about the possibilities on if they could transfer a star's energy to \nVibranium\n. She also noted information about the \nBlack Widow's Bite\n that was able to overtake \nT'Challa\n. However, Shuri was able to counter this disadvantage. On files about vehicles, she noted her envy towards \nScott Lang\n and \nHank Pym\n for being able to go to the \nQuantum Realm\n. Shuri also questioned if the \nScepter\n unlocked \nWanda Maximoff\n's abilities or if they were already part of her. Shuri eventually got to a file containing a warning for her not to use Vibranium in public.\nShuri finally compiled her discoveries while scanning \nVision\n in \n2018\n. She wrote this into her notes on the \nInfinity Stones\n. Overall, she had learned many things, but was saddened at all the time she had lost. She also mourned the loss of a great mind in \nTony Stark\n.\n[\n11\n]\nTeaching Assata\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri watching \nAssata\n present her impressive technology\n \n \n\"Our dreams are the best and most honest parts of ourselves. If a path toward your dream is not already lit, sometimes you must be the one who shines the light.\"\nShuri to \nAssata\n[src]\nShuri had \nAssata\n as a student in her class at \nWakanda University\n. She watched Assata present her invention which would make mining easier for the \nMining Tribe\n. Shuri was so impressed with the invention that she offered Assata a position as her assistant in the \nWakandan Design Group\n.\nHowever, Assata went to Shuri the next day to turn down the offer, having opted to join the \nDora Milaje\n. Shuri nodded and told Assata that dreams are the most honest part of the self, advising her to light the path toward her dream.\n[\n10\n]\nLosing Her Brother\n[\n]\nAttempts to Recreate the Herb\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri fails to recreate the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n \n \n\"Princess, you should go be by his side.\"\n\"I have to think. Everyone, get out... Get out!\"\nDoctor and Shuri\n[src]\nShuri was told by her \nbrother\n that he had fallen ill from an unknown disease and asked for her help. Shuri then made her top priority to recreate the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n, which she had been studying since her return to life,\n[\n11\n]\n and hoped it could heal him.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri being told of \nT'Challa\n's death\n \n \nOver the next few weeks, Shuri tried every known combination to recreate the herb. Ultimately, T'Challa was in critical condition, while \nRamonda\n and others were next to him, Shuri stayed in her \nlaboratory\n trying to speed the process. She used \nGriot\n's help to run the tests. On her last try, she asked for the confidence interval, which turned out to be less than 30%. After creating it, Shuri grabbed the synthetic herb and tried to rush to her brother, but was stopped by her mother, who confirmed T'Challa's passing. In denial, Shuri asked Griot to reveal what T'Challa's heart rate, which Griot confirmed was non-existent, as the King had indeed passed away.\n[\n2\n]\nT'Challa's Funeral\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri attending \nT'Challa\n's funeral\n \n \nShuri and her \nmother\n then took part in the funeral ceremony, wearing the white funeral gowns and proceeding through with the coffin. Before the coffin was beamed up by a \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n, Shuri put her face against it and wept. She then looked up as it was beamed and closed her eyes.\n[\n2\n]\nVisiting Assata\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri introduces her \nmother\n to \nAssata\n \n \nShuri told \nRamonda\n about \nAssata\n's decision to follow her dream of joining the \nDora Milaje\n. As a result, Shuri and Ramonda visited Assata. Assata happily greeted Ramonda, who returned the greeting and commended Assata for following her dream.\n[\n10\n]\nTalokanil-Wakandan War\n[\n]\nMeeting Namor\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri sees \nRamonda\n \n \n\"If I sit and think about my \nbrother\n for too long, it won't be these clothes that burn... it would be the world.\"\nShuri\n[src]\nIn \n2025\n, Shuri was working in her \nlaboratory\n, building new models and a new armor. She had her assistants working around her as well as \nGriot\n providing assistance. She was creating \nMidnight Angel Armor\n, which \nOkoye\n believed looked bad. As she was working, Griot tried to get her attention, but she told him not now. Her \nmother\n then walked in, in which Griot said that was what he had been trying to say. She reminded Shuri that it had been \none year\n exactly and it was time to burn their funeral clothes. She told Shuri to come with her and leave her \nKimoyo Beads\n behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri mourns \nT'Challa\n \n \nRamonda took her out to the edge of the river and lit a fire. They talked about \nT'Challa\n before Ramonda told Shuri how she was able to cope with the loss. She wanted Shuri to burn her ceremonial gown, but Shuri refused, in denial about the fact that T'Challa was dead and it was not her fault. Suddenly, a man peered out from the water. Shuri and Ramonda instantly took defensive stances with their spears. The man introduced himself as the \nK'uk'ulkan\n or Namor. Despite Ramonda being very worried and defensive, Namor told them that T'Challa exposing the world to \nVibranium\n put his own \nsecret country\n in jeopardy. Shuri then noticed that he was covered in vibranium. \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri protects herself\n \n \nNamor told them that an \nAmerican\n \nscientist\n created a \nVibranium Detector\n. Namor believed that since \nWakanda\n caused the problem, they should help Talokan finish it. He wanted the Wakandans to bring the scientist to him. Ramonda told Namor that they would not fight his problems, but Namor argued it was Wakanda's problem, too, because if they did not help, it would be war. He then left a conk shell, telling them to blow into it when they could retrieve the scientist. Namor then left Wakanda without a trace of how he entered. Shuri and Ramonda turned around to find the detector behind them.\n[\n2\n]\nMeeting Riri Williams\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri studies the \nVibranium Detector\n \n \n\"Brilliance at a young age is not always accepted by the elders.\"\nShuri to \nRiri Williams\n[src]\nWhile \nWakanda\n had a meeting about both what to do and how \nNamor\n got into the country, Shuri took apart the \nVibranium Detector\n, seeing how sophisticated it was. She marveled at how it had both high tech parts and parts that were made of what looked like junk from a scrapyard. As \nOkoye\n and \nRamonda\n arrived, Shuri asked when they were leaving.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri meets with \nEverett Ross\n \n \nShuri and Okoye arrived in \nAlexandria\n, \nVirginia\n and trailed \nEverett Ross\n in hopes that he would tell them information. Ross was very skeptical as he knew he could be tried for treason or other crimes. However, he did tell them that the scientist was in \nCambridge\n, \nMassachusetts\n. When he referred to the scientist as a kid, Shuri was very impressed.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri and \nOkoye\n find \nRiri Williams\n \n \nShuri and Okoye went to \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n and scouted out the scientist, \nRiri Williams\n. They saw her side business where she did other's homework for cash. Shuri argued with Okoye, convincing her to let Shuri talk to Williams. Okoye was more worried about how her makeup was. They went to Williams' dorm room and Shuri approached Williams. She was flattered at first, but did not want to go with Shuri. Williams claimed she was going to the bathroom, but Okoye knew her plan, coming out of the room to stop her.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri meets \nRiri Williams\n \n \nGetting scared, Williams picked up her speaker and threw it. Okoye effortlessly sliced it in half. They then tried to talk down Williams, who made fun of Okoye for her makeup. As Shuri chuckled, Okoye felt betrayed as Shuri claimed it was okay. Okoye and Shuri then decided to leave, noting that Williams would be left to fight a very strong \nfish man\n alone. Hearing this, Williams agreed to come with them for protection.\n[\n2\n]\nChase in Cambridge\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri sees the \nArc Reactor\n blueprints\n \n \n\"I'm Shuri, Princess of \nWakanda\n. I demand that you take me to \nNamor\n. Do not bring harm to this \ngirl\n.\"\nShuri to \nAttuma\n and \nNamora\n[src]\nShuri, \nOkoye\n, and \nRiri Williams\n arrived at her \ngarage\n. Williams warned them not to touch anything. As Williams gathered her stuff, she talked about how much code was put into locking her computer, noting that one time she locked herself out. Shuri was more interested in the bulletin board, seeing plans for an \nArc Reactor\n. Shuri asked if she was creating an \nIron Man\n suit, but Williams reminded her not to touch anything.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri escapes on a motorcycle\n \n \nSuddenly, they heard the \nFBI\n outside, calling for Shuri to come out and surrender Williams. Angry, Williams threw all of her blueprints in the trash and burned it all so there was no evidence. While she ridiculed the \nWakandans\n, Okoye found a car and told Shuri to get in as she was under her protection. Shuri argued that she should take the motorcycle so there was room for Williams. However, Williams said that she had another way out. She then brought down her own \nIron Man Armor\n, calling it Ironheart.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri drives alongside \nOkoye\n \n \nWith Williams getting out, Shuri and Okoye got into the car. However, Shuri told \nGriot\n to get into autopilot. She then jumped out of the car as Okoye left, unable to control the car. Shuri then took the motorcycle and escaped herself. They then went on a high speed chase down \nCambridge\n towards \nBoston\n. As Shuri drove alongside Okoye, Shuri was told that there was a drone above.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri is struck with a \nHydrobomb\n \n \nIronheart flew upwards to hit it out of the air, but Shuri warned her about the lack of oxygen. Williams believed she could make it. Williams eventually did hit the drone, but fell down towards the water, unconscious. Shuri feared for Williams, who woke up just before hitting the water. Suddenly, the officers were in front of Shuri and Okoye. Williams told them not to worry as she sent down a present. The drone that Williams hit then dropped on top of the officers, allowing them to get away.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri is unconscious\n \n \nThey drove further until Williams was suddenly grabbed out of the air. Shuri looked over to see a giant whale jumping out of the water. They blasted Shuri and Okoye with \nHydrobombs\n, causing them to go flying. Shuri activated her \nKimoyo Beads\n, breaking her fall, but still knocking her out. Shuri finally woke up when she was splashed by water coming from Okoye's fall when she was thrown off the bridge by the \nTalokanil\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri is taken by \nAttuma\n \n \nShuri was greeted by \nAttuma\n, who explained that they needed them alive. Attuma then took off his \nTalokanil Respirator\n and put it on Shuri's mouth, telling her to breathe. They then took both Shuri and Williams to \nTalokan\n.\n[\n2\n]\nTaken to Talokan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri talks to \nRiri Williams\n \n \n\"When I lost my \nbrother\n it just felt different. He suffered in silence. When he finally asked me to help him, I couldn't. How does that make sense that the ancestors would give me gifts and skills to help me save my brother, and I couldn't?\"\nShuri to \nNamor\n[src]\nShuri awoke in a \ncenote\n in \nTalokan\n. She woke up \nRiri Williams\n, who started panicking. Shuri tried to get her to breathe, but Williams was too scared. Shuri pointed out how the glowbugs above gave off light to the cave. Williams asked why \nWakanda\n could not just send the \nBlack Panther\n, but Shuri had to explain that it would never work anymore. They were then greeted by \nNamora\n, who gave Shuri clothes.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri talks with \nNamor\n \n \nShuri got dressed and was taken to \nNamor\n's hut. The two talked and Namor revealed his past. He talked about how his species came to be and how his \nmother\n was one of the first \nTalokanil\n. He also talked about how a \nSpanish\n settler cursed him as the \nboy without love\n, or Namor. Namor then gave Shuri a high pressure suit. Shuri put it on and followed him into the water.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri explores \nTalokan\n \n \nShuri traveled to the deep depths of the underwater country of Talokan. Shuri hit a tide and spun down into the bottom of the ocean where she was met by Namor. Suddenly, a whale swam above them, leading Shuri to be shocked at how advanced everything was and even saw a giant \nthrone\n made of \nVibranium\n. Shuri kept looking around astonished and how beautiful everything and everyone was.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri hears \nNamor\n's plan\n \n \nShuri and Namor sat down, believing that they understood each other. Namor gave Shuri his mother's bracelet as a gift since she was the first outsider in Talokan. So, the two started talking about how with Wakanda's help, they could rule the world and burn it to the ground. This struck a cord with Shuri, who did not agree with him anymore. Namor then claimed to have heard Shuri by the river, saying she wanted to burn the world.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri reunites with \nRamonda\n \n \nShuri returned to the cave, where she was met by Williams again. Suddenly, \nNakia\n arrived and nearly attacked the Talokanil. However, one of them grabbed Shuri by the neck. Nakia spoke \nYucatec\n Mayan, warning the woman. She then spoke in Xhosa, telling Shuri to move her left arm. When she did, Nakia \nblasted\n the Talokanil. Shuri asked for a \nKimoyo Bead\n to save the woman, but Nakia told her there was no hope, having Shuri jump on her speeder so they could escape with Williams. However, Shuri was worried that they just started a \nwar\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe Last of Royal Blood\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri with \nAneka\n \n \nShuri, \nNakia\n, and \nRiri Williams\n were beamed up by a \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n. In the fighter, Shuri saw \nRamonda\n and hugged her dearly. They then returned to \nWakanda\n. Once they returned, they tried to prepare for a possible war. Suddenly, there was a wave of water that swept through the city; the \nTalokanil\n have \nattacked\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri shoots at \nNamor\n \n \nShuri was working in her \nlab\n with \nAneka\n when Ramonda called. Ramonda tried to tell her not to engage, but Shuri did not listen, hanging up. Aneka disagreed with her decision to hang up on the queen, but Shuri said there was a difference as she actually hung up on her mother. They then got into a \nSunbird\n to help. Once they got in, they flew over to the survivors. However, \nNamor\n saw them. He flew up to the princess and took down their flyer, leaving them to crash into the water. Aneka told Shuri to get out, but she refused, saying she could reboot. They were then beamed up into a Talon Fighter.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri crying over \nRamonda\n \n \nShuri returned to the \nCitadel\n, only to see it almost underwater. She then found Ramonda and Williams unconscious on the ground, having drowned. Nakia was able to start Williams' heart, but \nOkoye\n struggled to do so with Ramonda. Shuri ran to her mother, but Okoye yelled at her to get back. Shuri struggled to get out of Aneka and \nM'Baku\n's hold on her. She broke down crying and fighting to get away as Ramonda was pronounced dead, meaning Shuri had lost another one. Namor told Shuri to bury the dead and mourn her losses as she was declared the queen now.\n[\n2\n]\nRamonda's Funeral\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri at \nRamonda\n's funeral\n \n \n\"The world has taken too much from you for you to still be considered a child.\"\n\nM'Baku\n to Shuri\n[src]\nShuri became cold as \nRamonda\n was prepared for her funeral. Having lost everyone she loved, Shuri just stared stone-faced into the distance as Ramonda's casket was taken up to the sky. When everyone left the funeral, Shuri stayed there. \nM'Baku\n approached her, knowing that she was having trouble. M'Baku asked for her acceptance of the proposition by the \nelders\n that the \nWakandans\n would relocate to \nJabari Land\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri talks to \nM'Baku\n \n \nShuri asked why he would want the opinion of a child who scoffed at tradition, remembering what he said to her at the \nCoronation of T'Challa\n. M'Baku simply told her that she had lost too much to be considered a child anymore. Shuri told M'Baku that if he provided for the people, they would be in great debt. M'Baku asked what her heart felt. Shuri told him that the last person who truly understood her was gone and her heart was gone with her.\n[\n2\n]\nBecoming Black Panther\n[\n]\nTaking the Herb\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri takes the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n \n \n\"You didn't believe the \nAncestral Plane\n was real did you?\"\n\"No.\"\nShuri and \nErik Killmonger\n[src]\nShuri returned to her \nlaboratory\n where she decided to try to recreate the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n once again as she wanted to take down \nNamor\n. She also did research with \nRiri Williams\n and figured out that Namor could lose oxygen through certain heating rays that they could build. With the help of \nNakia\n and \nT'Challa\n's DNA samples, she got a possible match on the herb. She recreated the artificial herb and mashed it up. Recreating the ceremony, she found herself in the \nAncestral Plane\n. She brought herself out of the water as the \nCitadel\n was flooded.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri in the \nAncestral Plane\n \n \nShe looked out into the purple sky and then turned around to the throne, asking \nRamonda\n if she was there. When she peered around the chair, she found \nErik Killmonger\n, much to her surprise. Shuri said she thought she would see her family, but Killmonger brushed it off and called it nonsense, saying that she did not believe the Ancestral Plane was real, which she admitted to. Killmonger claimed they were the same, but Shuri refused to believe it. Killmonger just said he had the courage.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri argues with \nErik Killmonger\n \n \nAs the place started being set on fire, Shuri yelled at Killmonger, blaming Namor and Ramonda's death on him. Killmonger said he had nothing to do with it, and he told Shuri not to take that away from Ramonda, who was protecting a lost girl from her \ntribe\n. However, \nT'Chaka\n was a hypocrite. Killmonger claimed T'Chaka would have killed \nRiri Williams\n right away. He also claimed T'Challa was too noble. So he asked if Shuri would be noble or take care of business like Killmonger.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri holds the new Black Panther mask\n \n \nShuri awoke from the Ancestral Plane and immediately told Nakia that it did not work. She argued with Nakia, believing that she did not feel any different. She angrily punched a mannequin, sending it flying across the room, showing her new strength. Nakia told her that she now needed a \nsuit\n. Shuri created the suit using her own designs and held it up in front of her.\n[\n2\n]\nWanting Vengeance\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Black Panther lives\n \n \n\"You speak of my \nmother\n as if she's still here, of what she would have wanted for me.

What matters is what I want, and what I want is Namor dead!\"\nBlack Panther to \nM'Baku\n[src]\nDonning her new \nsuit\n, the Black Panther arrived in \nJabari Land\n, dropping down into a meeting amongst the \nelders\n. She looked over to \nM'Baku\n, who held out his hand. The two of them arm wrestled with Shuri beating him using her strength. M'Baku then triumphantly yelled that the Black Panther lives. Everyone surrounded Shuri, happy for her and hopeful for a conclusion.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther speaks to the people\n \n \nThe Black Panther then talked to everyone, saying that \nNamor\n believed \nWakanda\n was on its knees and that they had no protector. She wanted to bring the fight to \nthem\n. The \nRiver Tribe Elder\n asked why they would bring it back to Wakanda, but Shuri explained she wanted to lure them to a separate place. She then asked permission to talk to M'Baku alone.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther orders \nM'Baku\n to help her\n \n \nNow in a room with M'Baku, Shuri and he talked about moral decisions. Shuri wanted Namor to pay, but M'Baku was skeptical as it could mean eternal war. Wanting vengeance, Shuri asked if \nRamonda\n was not worth eternal war. M'Baku said that of course she did, but it was not what she would want, and it was not what he wanted for his people. Shuri grew angry saying that he spoke as if she was still there, but she was gone. What mattered was not what Ramonda wanted, but what Shuri wanted, which was Namor dead. She ordered M'Baku to help her.\n[\n2\n]\nEnding the Conflict\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther talks to \nNakia\n before the fight\n \n \n\"Yield, and \nWakanda\n will protect your oceans, we will protect your secrets.

Nakia then told Shuri to breathe and asked for Shuri to tell her \nwho\n she saw in the \nAncestral Plane\n. Shuri immediately pulled away from Nakia, who told her that if she went to war with vengeance, it would not fill the hole in her heart, but only make it grow larger until it consumed her. Shuri simply said that it already had.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther successfully traps \nNamor\n \n \nThe \nWakandans\n went to the \nSea Leopard\n and lured the \nTalokanil\n there. When they arrived, Black Panther jumped to them, fitting her \nsuit\n with \nVibranium Gauntlets\n. She then fought the Talokanil, climbing along the side of the boat. She clawed at many Talokanil on her way around the boat, able to slice all of them with her nails. Suddenly, Namor was taken by a \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n. Shuri was told this and jumped in there with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther battling against \nNamor\n \n \nNow alone with Namor, she turned on the heat rays and said that she was there for retribution. Namor tried to attack, but became very sweaty and weak over the immense heat. Namor started ramming his \nspear\n into the ship. \nGriot\n told Shuri that his raw \nVibranium\n could make the ship explode. She told Griot to fly them to the desert. She then took on Namor in hand to hand. However, Namor knocked her away and slammed the ship again, causing it to explode.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther rips one of \nNamor\n's wings\n \n \nLanding on the desert, Black Panther got up and took off her gauntlets as they were destroyed. She then looked around for Namor, but was hit from behind. Namor picked her up, flying Black Panther into the air. She clawed at him, scratching his face until he rammed her into the ground, punching some more. She then was able to slice off Namor's ankle wing, causing him to scream in pain.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther is impaled by \nNamor\n \n \nThey exchanged more blows and Shuri dodged a few. Namor then knocked her into a wall and kicked her. She screamed in pain, but blocked a blow and then impaled his back with her claws. She then expelled energy and proceeded to gain the upper hand by knocking him down a few times with kicks. She then walked towards Namor, retracting her claws while Namor grabbed his spear, but he impaled Shuri in the stomach. She gasped in pain and unmasked herself, her nose bloody. She looked down and saw the fatal wound.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther blows up her ship\n \n \nShe sliced off the spear as Namor tried to make it to the water to stop himself from overheating. She lunged at Namor, who dodged her. A scared Namor said \"Imperius Rex.\" Shuri then protected herself, saying \"Wakanda Forever\", causing the ship to blow up, setting Namor on fire. As Namor wheezed for air and fell down, she used her feet to flip him over, so his back was on the ground, and took a spear and put it up to Namor's throat. However, she remembered her dying \nmother\n and realized who she had become. She then heard Ramonda, telling her to show him who \nshe\n was.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther points a spear at \nNamor\n \n \nShuri then yielded to Namor, telling him that vengeance had consumed them both. If he yielded, then his people would live, knowing how much he cared about his people. Namor did yield and the two flew back to the battlefield. Namor yelled to his people, telling them to stop fighting. Shuri then triumphantly yelled \"Wakanda Forever\" as the victorious Wakandans chanted back.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri says goodbye to \nRiri Williams\n \n \nReturning back to \nWakanda\n, everyone celebrated. However, Shuri went to a spot of land and planted the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n for the next Black Panther. She then met with \nRiri Williams\n. She told Williams that her name was cleared, and she could return. However, she warned her to stop her homework side business. She also told Williams that she needed to take her \nIronheart suit\n, which Williams understood.\n[\n2\n]\nLeaving Wakanda\n[\n]\nMeeting Her Nephew\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri leaves for \nHaiti\n \n \n\"Toussaint is my \nHaitian\n name.\"\n\"Ungubani?\n[\n17\n]\n \"\n\"My name is Prince T'Challa, son of \nKing T'Challa\n.\"\n\nT'Challa II\n and Shuri\n[src]\nShuri decided not to attend her incoronation, instead leaving \nM'Baku\n to take the crown unchallenged. She went to \nHaiti\n and got help from civilians who led her to \nNakia\n's \nresidence\n. Before walking in, she noticed \nOkoye\n behind her. Shuri told Okoye that she did not need protection anymore. Okoye knew this, saying she was going to travel the world with her \nMidnight Angel Armor\n. They said goodbye before parting ways.\n[\n18\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri mourns \nT'Challa\n \n \nWalking into Nakia's residence, the two greeted each other. Shuri told Nakia that she needed to do something herself. She then went down to the beach. Sitting and looking into the water, she started crying, remembering \nT'Challa\n. She took \nRamonda\n's advice and burned her ceremonial gown, signifying how she had finally moved past the trauma.\n \n \n \n \n \nShuri meets her nephew, Prince \nT'Challa II\n \n \nSuddenly, Shuri was approached from behind by Nakia and who she introduced as her son, \nToussaint\n. Shuri talked to Toussaint as Nakia revealed that T'Challa prepared them for his death and that Toussaint was his son. Shuri's tears turned into joy as she realized she had a nephew. She talked to Toussaint as Nakia explained that T'Challa did not want them to attend the funeral. Shuri asked if Ramonda met him, which she did. Toussaint then said that he believed she could keep a secret. He told her that Toussaint was his Haitian name. His real name was Prince T'Challa, son of T'Challa.\n[\n2\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"Just because something works doesn't mean it cannot be improved.\"\nShuri\n[src]\nShuri is a technological genius at heart, making good use of the abundance of the rare metal \nVibranium\n to help advance her home country. She is always willing to continue innovations for whatever she invents, believing there's no end to a device's improvement. The \nWakandan\n princess gets very excited to have her latest creation used by herself, her \nbrother\n, etc. to see how effective it is. Like many younger siblings, Shuri has a very childlike demeanor, always teasing \nT'Challa\n and never having many regards to formality. But she loves her family a lot and does become very concerned for her brother's safety. Not to mention that she has faith in her brother in becoming a great king and the next Black Panther, always willing to stand by his side.\nShuri is a big fan of American culture, with a lot of her inventions hinted to be directly inspired by movies that she would watch with \nher father\n. She often dresses in American style clothing as well, such as brand t-shirts, jeans, and shorts in high contrast to the traditional or high-class clothes of other Wakandans. Shuri also disliked traditional ceremonial clothing, once complaining about the corset she had to wear during T'Challa's \ncrowning ceremony\n. She also appears to be very interested in social media, recording instances of her pranks on T'Challa and quoting internet memes at him. She can also be sarcastic at times and doesn't suffer fools. When Everett Ross asked Shuri what to do with the Wakandan planes he found, she responded impatiently, since she was fighting off Killmonger at the time, telling him \"Shoot them down, genius!\".\nThe traumatic events of the \nInfinity War\n and \nbeing gone for five years\n caused Shuri to become more mature, as how those events had been frightening. Combined with this, and the deaths of T'Challa and Ramonda, Shuri became hardened in personality. However, she managed to be able to crack jokes and find joy in little things, retaining her innocence. By the time her brother died by his illness, she became isolated in her technology as a way to grieve her brother's death and possibly to prevent her from thinking about her late brother, and refused to properly deal with his brother's sudden passing and did not want to burn the ceremonial robes, and felt responsible as she could not synthesize the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n in time. It was at this period of time that the \nMidnight Angel Armor\n and the new weapons for the \nDora Milaje\n were created, while the project of recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb was suspended as Shuri didn't want to face her guilt and sadness. Deep inside, after the death of her brother and the consequent aggression of other surface powers, she developed a vengeful personality.\nThis sense of revenge was fully heightened when her mother died not long after as well. When \nNamor\n killed Ramonda in his attack on Wakanda, she was filled with vengeance and determination to kill Namor for what he did to her mother, as all her family members have passed away now. Even \nM'Baku\n and \nNakia\n understand Shuri's rage, but felt that vengeance would consume her, the same way it had consumed her cousin \nNJadaka\n. Her desire for revenge eventually brought her to N'Jadaka in the ancestral plane, where she was persuaded to go on the vengeful ways. She became arrogant and refused to listen to M'Baku's plan of not killing Namor to prevent eternal war, determined to end the \nwar\n and avenge her fallen family. But when she had the chance of killing Namor after gravely injuring the latter who was dehydrated, she later realized that vengeance is not only consuming Namor, but also herself, and she doesn't want both Wakanda and \nTalokan\n being consumed by vengeance, something she learned from her late brother, who went on a similar path as her. She realized the similarities between the Talokan ruler and herself, which led her to propose a truce with the sea-dwellers and finally be able to see her mother in the \nAncestral Plane\n, who encouraged her to be herself once more. After the conflict with Talokan and Namor, the Wakandan princess finally was able to grieve her loss and accept the passing of her brother, and burnt the ceremonial robes in Haiti.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\nHeart-Shaped Herb\n Enhancement\n: Shuri consumed an artificial \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n and was granted enhanced strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes and healing. The effects could be removed by drinking a serum that negates the powers of the herbs.\nEnhanced Strength\n: The Heart-Shaped Herb gave Shuri enhanced strength, allowing her to send a mannequin against a wall with a single punch in her first display of strength when she hit it out of anger believing the synthetic herb had not worked. She became stronger than the much larger M'Baku, who tested her with an arm wrestle before declaring her the Black Panther. In a duel against \nNamor\n, first inside the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n and then in the desert when the aircraft was destroyed, Shuri exchanged powerful blows against him, and swiftly threw him into the air and back on the ground with a single hand.\nEnhanced Durability\n: Even though she was helped by wearing the \nPanther Habit\n, Shuri could withstand extreme blunt force trauma. She survived unfazed the explosion of a \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n that had been compromised by \nNamor\n and the subsequent fall to the ground, along with the many blows that Namor hit her with. It took being impaled by Namor's Vibranium spear to significantly injure her.\nEnhanced Speed\n: Shuri's enhanced speed allowed to quickly move and react during her first actual battle as the new Black Panther, moving across the side of the \nSea Leopard\n to fight the first \nTalokanil\n warriors that tried to board the ship. As she focused on battling \nNamor\n, Shuri ran and quickly moved towards him when she first engaged him, and during the rest of their battle.\nEnhanced Agility\n: Shuri used his newly-acquired agility when she first engaged the \nTalokanil\n warriors aboard the \nSea Leopard\n. In order to defeat the first wave of warriors, she jumped on the sides of the ship, dodging and attacking the warriors until the time came to confront their leader, \nNamor\n. She then accurately jumped towards the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n, where he had already been trapped.\nEnhanced Stamina\n: Shuri could potentially exert great energy without any sign of fatigue, fighting both the \nTalokanil\n warriors and \nNamor\n for a considerable amount of time, not even losing her breath until she injured by being impaled by Namor's spear.\nEnhanced Reflexes\n: The \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n was able to increase Shuri's reflexes along the rest of her physical capabilities. This allowed her to effectively hit and evade her opponent's blows while fighting. Shuri managed to evade some of \nNamor\n's blows when she first fought him inside the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n, and while fighting him on the ground, accurately go for one of his ankle wings, slicing it with her claws.\nRegenerative Healing Factor\n: Shuri's healing was extraordinarily enhanced, to the point of surviving and rapidly recovering from being impaled by \nNamor\n's spear. Even with the open wound, she was able to stand on her feet, and showed no signs of it by the time she travelled to \nHaiti\n after the war against the \nTalokanil\n.\nPanther Habit\n Capabilities\n: As the Black Panther, Shuri made herself a \nVibranium\n Panther Habit suit that was fitted with gold armor as well as dots to mimic her look while in battle.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: The vibranium in the habit increased Shuri's durability, making her invulnerable to conventional damage. The habit made her able to withstand the attacks from the powerful \nNamor\n. However, its Vibranium composition was also able to be penetrated by other vibranium weapons thrown with enough strength, as Namor's raw vibranium spear was able to impale Shuri through the habit.\nClaw Retraction\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther retracts her claws\n \n \n Black Panther's suit was fitted with claws. She used this to track across the walls of the \nSea Leopard\n and take care of the many \nTalokanil\n that were climbing up the side. She also used her claws to scratch \nNamor\n's face and back. When she was impaled by a spear, she sliced through the spear's rod with her claws.\nKinetic Energy Absorption\n: Shuri's habit was similar to \nT'Challa\n's in the fact that it was fitted with kinetic energy storage that could store the energy so she could redistribute it when needed.\nEnergy Projection\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Panther shoots blasts of sonic energy\n \n \n Shuri invented her own \nVibranium Gauntlets\n in case she ever went into battle. These gauntlets were designed to look like panther heads with the energy emitting out of the mouth like a panther's roar. When she became the Black Panther, she fitted her gauntlets within the suit. Using her \nVibranium Gauntlets\n, Shuri can shoot blasts of sonic energy. It is powerful enough to briefly subdue Killmonger in the \nPanther Habit\n. They are also able to send grown men flying several feet. During the battle with \nNamor\n, she blasted him with it, causing to \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n to explode. She also knocked many \nTalokanil\n off the side of the \nSea Leopard\n with the blasts.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"You are teaching me? What do you know?\"\n\"More than you.\"\n\nT'Challa\n and Shuri\n[src]\nGenius-Level Intellect\n: Shuri is extraordinarily intelligent despite her young age. Indeed, her intelligence marks her as one of the smartest humans in the world, which allows her to be in charge of the \nWakandan Design Group\n and create some of the most recent \nWakandan\n advanced technology. She was able to figure out how \nNamor\n's physiology worked which allowed her to heat up his body to weaken him.\n\"I'm here for the EMP beads. I've developed an update.\"\nShuri to \nT'Challa\n[src]\nMaster Engineer\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri modifying her gauntlets\n \n \n Shuri is an exceptionally accomplished and ingeniously prolific engineer, as she developed and has overseen \nWakanda\n's technology, including weaponry, defenses, communications, transportation, her own \nenergy blast gauntlets\n, her brother \nT'Challa\n's new \nPanther Habit\n and \nBucky Barnes\n' Vibranium arm. Her usage of advanced technology integrating nanotechnology in the Panther habit preceded the genius \nTony Stark\n's \nfiftieth armor\n. She created the \nMidnight Angels\n armor as well as helping create the \nIronheart Armor: Mark II\n. She also created her own Panther Habit.\n\"The scientist leading this initiative is the most gifted in \nWakanda\n...\"\n\nT'Challa\n[src]\nMaster Scientist\n: Shuri is an exceptional scientist, being the leader of the science division of Wakanda, and having expertise in fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry, medicine and computer programming. Some of her most impressive features were saving \nEverett Ross\n from an injury that would have rendered him paraplegic in a matter of hours, being able to remove \nBucky Barnes\n' programming, or come up with a method to remove the \nMind Stone\n harmlessly from \nVision\n superior to that of the renowned scientist \nBruce Banner\n. Using \nFen\n's bracelet, Shuri was able to create an artificial \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n. She is considered the smartest person in the world, even surpassing Tony Stark.\nMaster Physician\n: Shuri was able to work on \nEverett Ross\n and heal him after a bullet to his side. She also was able to experiment on \nBucky Barnes\n to remove his mind control.\nExpert Tactician\n: Shuri led the attack against \nNamor\n as the Black Panther. This included leading the \nTalokanils\n to the \nSea Leopard\n as a trap.\nMaster Martial Artist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri fighting against \nKillmonger\n \n \n As Shuri is the leader of the Wakandan Design Group, but not a Wakandan warrior, she rarely fights in the frontlines. Despite this, Shuri is an excellent combatant in her own right. She managed to briefly fight against \nErik Killmonger\n for a time, but was swiftly defeated and able to survive the Battle of Mount Bashenga with no injury, and even Battle of Earth. Later she was able to hold her own and eventually overpower \nNamor\n in their fight.\nExpert Marksman\n: Shuri is an excellent markswoman, she is able to shoot blasts of sonic energy from her \nVibranium Gauntlets\n very accurately. During \nBattle of Mount Bashenga\n and \nBattle of Earth\n, she was able to hit many targets with the gauntlets.\nMaster Acrobat\n: Shuri flipped around the side of the \nSea Leopard\n and did not fall into the water. She also performed many acrobatic attacks while fighting \nNamor\n.\nBilingualism\n: Shuri is fluent in her native Xhosa, as well as English.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nPanther Habit\n[\n]\nPanther Habit\n: As Black Panther, Shuri donned a uniquely crafted \nvibranium\n-weave combat suit that, like \nCaptain America's Shield\n, is lightweight, nigh-indestructible, and renders her immune to most physical damages, especially from collisions and conventional firearms.\nVibranium Claws\n: Two sets of retractable and extendable vibranium claws embedded in the fingers of the gloves like nails. The suit can also deploy claws from its knuckles, and they were able to hurt \nNamor\n's face.\nWeapons\n[\n]\nVibranium Gauntlets\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri with her Vibranium Gauntlets\n \n \n These gauntlets shoot blasts of sonic energy powerful enough to briefly subdue \nKillmonger\n in his own Panther Habit. They are also able to send grown men flying several feet, and in conjunction with \nWasp\n and \nPepper Potts\n, were able to send \nThanos\n backwards. After becoming the Black Panther Shuri fitted her Vibranium Gauntlets within her \nPanther Habit\n.\nSonic Spear\n: Shuri goes into battle against \nKillmonger\n's forces and gains one of these weapons, which Killmonger states are powerful enough to stop a tank.\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\nKimoyo Beads\n: Shuri is able to communicate with people and remote Wakandan technology using these beads, including control of the vast Vibranium mines.\nRemote Access Kimoyo Beads\n: Shuri uses this equipment to drive and pilot various vehicles from her \nlab\n in \nWakanda\n. These disks also possess an array of advanced technological capabilities.\nVehicles\n[\n]\nRoyal Talon Fighter\n: Shuri helped \nEverett Ross\n pilot the Royal Talon Fighter to stop Killmonger's ships from leaving Wakanda. Years later, after the RTF reported damage, Shuri told \nGriot\n to take her and Namor to the desert.\nDesigns\n[\n]\n\"Do you like that one?\"\n\"Tempting, but the idea is to not be noticed.\"\nShuri and \nT'Challa\n[src]\nPanther Habit\n: Upgraded by Shuri, the Panther Habit is now one of \nWakanda\n's more advanced products, housing an advanced array of sophisticated technology to greatly enhance T'Challa's capabilities as the Black Panther. The most prominent feature of the upgraded Habit is its ability to redistribute stored energy. It can receive energy from any incoming source, such as bullets being fired at T'Challa or attacks from enemies.\nGriot\n: Griot is an artificial intelligence created by Shuri, using it such as to guide \nEverett Ross\n to pursue three jets that \nErik Killmonger\n had ordered an attack on \nNew York City\n, \nLondon\n and \nHong Kong\n.\n\"Fully automated, like the \nold American movie\n \nBaba\n used to watch. And I made them completely sound absorbent.\"\nShuri to \nT'Challa\n[src]\nSneakers\n: Shuri created sneakers that are sound adsorbent and are incorporated into the Panther Habit with the use of Wakandan nanotechnology.\nRemote Access Kimoyo Beads\n: The Remote Access Beads can transmit control to the console in Shuri's Lab, allowing a user to remotely pilot any vehicle they're placed on, even from large distances.\nVibranium Gauntlets\n: Due to the connection between Wakanda and the panther goddess Bast, Shuri designed the gauntlets so they would have the shape of a panther. The Vibranium Gauntlets can fire single energy shots that are powerful enough to throw grown men in the air and force a wearer of a Panther Habit to step back when hit.\nFacilities\n[\n]\nCitadel\n: As a member of the Royal Family of \nWakanda\n, Shuri spent time in the Citadel. She watched in the Citadel as \nErik Killmonger\n arrived and challenged \nT'Challa\n for the throne. Upon her return in the \nBlip\n, Shuri reunited with her family in the Citadel. She later rushed into the room in an attempt to save \nRamonda\n as it flooded, but was too late. Shuri then ingested a synthetic \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n, which brought her to a recreation of the Citadel by the \nAstral Plane\n, where she confronted Killmonger about her choice on how to deal with \nNamor\n.\nWakanda University\n: Shuri was a student at Wakanda University when she was less than ten years old. By the time she was thirteen years old, she became a professor at the university. She taught \nAssata\n in the school and was impressed by her inventions.\nShuri's Lab\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nShuri in her personal laboratory\n \n \n Shuri personally designed her laboratory beneath \nMount Bashenga\n, close to \nWakandan\n \nVibranium\n \nmine\n. Together with the \nWakandan Design Group\n, Shuri worked in her lab on new designs based on Vibranium. Before the battle with \nErik Killmonger\n's forces, Shuri left \nEverett Ross\n in the lab to take control over the \nRoyal Talon Fighter\n and destroy Vibranium weapons. As he completed his task, Ross managed to escape while the lab was destroyed by the \nDragon Flyer\n. She attempted to recreate the \nHeart-Shaped Herb\n in the lab, but failed, leading to \nT'Challa\n's death. Shuri then buried herself in her work, spending all of her time in the lab. She brought \nRiri Williams\n to the lab, where they worked on a plan to defeat \nNamor\n together.\nWakanda Medical Center\n: Shuri worked to help people who needed medical attention in \nWakanda\n's medical center. She used it to heal \nEverett Ross\n, who had been shot, as well as to free \nBucky Barnes\n from his brainwashing. She then later had \nVision\n brought to the medical center, where she worked to get the \nMind Stone\n out of him, but was attacked by \nCorvus Glaive\n.\nPrisons\n[\n]\nNamor's Cenote\n: Shuri and \nRiri Williams\n were taken by \nTalokanil\n \nforces\n and brought to a cave in \nTalokan\n, where they were held in order to get Shuri to have Williams stay in Talokan. Shuri was taken by Namor to his part of the cave, where Namor told her about his past. Shuri and Williams were rescued from the cave by \nNakia\n, who shot one of the Talokanil, leading to \nwar\n between Talokan and \nWakanda\n.\nRelationships\n[\n]\nFamily\n[\n]\nGolden Tribe\nBashenga\n  - Paternal Ancestor\nPaternal Ancestor-in-Law\n[\n19\n]\n \nAndile\n[\n20\n]\n  - Paternal Great Great Great Great-Grandfather\nBazwale\n  - Paternal Great Great Great-Grandfather\nYima\n  - Paternal Great Great-Grandfather\nKabba\n  - Paternal Great-Grandfather\nAzzuri\n  - Paternal Grandfather\nT'Chaka\n  - Father\nRamonda\n  - Mother\nN'Jobu\n  - Paternal Uncle\nT'Challa/Black Panther\n  - Brother and Predecessor\nN'Jadaka/Erik Killmonger\n  - Paternal Cousin and Attempted Killer\nT'Challa II\n - Nephew\nLumumba\n - Maternal Grandmother\nPaternal Aunt-by-Marriage\n \nAllies\n[\n]\nWakanda University\nWakandan Design Group\nGriot\n - Creation\nDora Milaje\nAyo\nXoliswa\n \nNomble\nYama\nAssata\n - Former Student\nJemini\nAneka\nWar Dogs\nNakia\n - Close Friend\nMidnight Angels\nOkoye\n - Close Friend\nZuri\n \nTribal Council\nM'Kathu\nZawavari\nRiver Tribe Elder\nMerchant Tribe Elder\nMining Tribe Elder\nWakandan Royal Guard\nBorder Tribe\n - Temporary Enemies\nEverett Ross\n - Former Patient and Friend\nJabari Tribe\n - Temporary Enemies\nM'Baku\n - Friend\nM20\nBucky Barnes/Winter Soldier\n - Former Patient\nAvengers\nSteve Rogers/Captain America\nTony Stark/Iron Man\n \nBruce Banner/Hulk\n - Resurrector\nVision\n  - Patient\nWanda Maximoff\n \nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\n \nSam Wilson/Falcon\nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nThor\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\nScott Lang/Ant-Man\nClint Barton/Hawkeye\nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nRocket\nGroot\nDrax the Destroyer\nMantis\nNebula\nMasters of the Mystic Arts\nStephen Strange/Doctor Strange\nWong\nBrunnhilde/Valkyrie\nWarsong\nKorg\nMiek\nEinherjar\nRavagers\nKraglin Obfonteri\nHoward the Duck\nHope van Dyne/Wasp\nPepper Potts/Rescue\nGamora\nRiri Williams/Ironheart\n - Friend\nTalokanil\n - Former Enemies\nNamor\n - Former Attempted Killer and Former Attempted Victim\nNamora\n - Former Kidnapper\nAttuma\n - Former Kidnapper\nEnemies\n[\n]\nUlysses Klaue\n \nW'Kabi\n - Former Ally\nBlack Order\nCorvus Glaive\n  - Attempted Killer\nThanos\n  - Killer\nThanos\n \nBlack Order\nEbony Maw\n \nCull Obsidian\n \nProxima Midnight\n \nCorvus Glaive\n \nChitauri\nLeviathans\nChitauri Gorillas\nOutriders\nSakaarans\nFBI\n - Situational Enemies\nCambridge Police Department\n - Situational Enemies\nAppearances\n[\n]\nAppearances for Black Panther\nIn chronological order:\n \nBlack Panther\n \nAvengers: Infinity War Prelude\n, Issue 1\n \nBlack Panther: A Novel\n \nMarvel Die-Cut Classic: Black Panther\n \nAvengers: Infinity War\n \nAvengers: Endgame Prelude\n, Issue 2\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n \nWandaVision\n | Episode 1.09: \nThe Series Finale\n \n(memory)\n \nThe Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond\n \nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever: The Courage to Dream\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n | Episode 1.04: \nThe Whole World Is Watching\n \n(mentioned)\n \nMs. Marvel\n | Episode 1.01: \nGeneration Why\n \n(depiction)\n \nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n \nBlack Panther - Wakanda Forever: The Screenplay\n \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law\n | Episode 1.09: \nWhose Show is This?\n \n(photo)\n \nAvengers: Doomsday\n \n(unreleased)\n[\n7\n]\nBlack Panther 3\n \n(unreleased)\n[\n8\n]\n \nLoki\n | Episode 1.06: \nFor All Time.
