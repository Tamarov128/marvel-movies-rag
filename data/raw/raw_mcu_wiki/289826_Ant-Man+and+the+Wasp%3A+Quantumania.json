He is liked and respected in his hometown of San Francisco, and has even written a successful \nmemoir\n. Things are also going well for his girlfriend \nHope van Dyne\n, who now runs her own company and is using \nPym Particles\n to help the world, as well as her parents Hank Pym and \nJanet van Dyne\n who are just happy to be reunited following Janet's thirty years trapped in the \nQuantum Realm\n although Janet still refuses to talk about her time there. The only bone of contention for Lang is that his daughter \nCassie\n, who is now living with him and Hope, has been arrested more than once due to her participation in protests. After Lang and van Dyne bail her out, the two have a mild argument where she accuses her father of enjoying his fame and not actually doing anything to help the world now that it is not under an immediate threat. She also accidentally implies during the conversation that she has her own super suit, but quickly tries to shrug it off when her father enquiries further. \n \n \n \n \n \nScott\n and \nCassie\n appear in the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \nThey head to the \nPym Residence\n to have dinner, and the conversation turns to a device that Cassie and Pym have been working on; a \nQuantum Satellite\n. They explain it is designed to try and send a signal into the Quantum Realm to try and establish communications. Janet freaks out when she realizes that someone could send a signal back and demands it be shut down; however, the device ends up imploding and sucking in the five, along with some ants that Pym had been experimenting on to increase their intelligence. The Pym/Van Dyne family are separated from Scott and Cassie and land in a completely different part of the Quantum Realm to the two. \n \n \n \n \n \nM.O.D.O.K.\n greets \nAnt-Man\n \n \nScott manages to rescue Cassie from falling to her death before confronting an alliance called the \nFreedom Fighters\n as Hope and Pym are guided through the Quantum Realm by Janet, who later brings them to \nAxia\n to meet an \nold friend\n. Scott and Cassie perform a ritual to understand the Freedom Fighters' language, learning of a \nman\n who managed to conquer what was once the home of the Freedom Fighters. Upon meeting Janet's friend Krylar, Krylar has the \nruler's guard\n attack Janet's relatives, leading them to escape in \nKrylar's Yacht\n. The Freedom Fighters are also soon under attack by the guard and \nM.O.D.O.K.\n, whom Scott and Cassie find out is none other than Darren Cross, who is now deformed from the Yellowjacket suit's destruction and has been left with a massive head but tiny limbs necessitating him to use a hover chair.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man\n makes a deal with \nKang the Conqueror\n \n \nWhile Scott is arrested and forced to make a deal with the man named Kang, having to retrieve the \nMultiversal Engine Core\n, Janet explains to Hope and Hank that Kang the Conqueror was a scientist also trapped in the Quantum Realm who attempted to fix his \nTime Sphere\n, only to have Janet sabotage his departure because she realized from his ship's engine that he had destroyed several timelines and took countless lives, and hadn't actually crashed in the Quantum Realm as she'd assumed but was exiled there. As Ant-Man, Lang shrinks into the enlarged, blown up Multiversal Power Core, shrinking it with the Wasp's help. Because they rebel against him, Kang steals the Power Core from them, defeating Ant-Man and the Wasp and taking Janet with him as M.O.D.O.K. crashes Pym's ship.\n \n \n \n \n \nWasp\n rescues \nAnt-Man\n \n \nKang explains his origin and his plan to thwart the \nCouncil of Kangs\n for exiling him to Janet as Cassie evades captivity and frees the Freedom Fighters. Ant-Man and the Wasp meet Pym, accompanied by the smarter \nants\n who have also traveled to the Quantum Realm. Cassie interrupts Kang's transmission to Axia, telling all residents to fight against Kang. Telling M.O.D.O.K. to kill Cassie, Kang is confronted by Giant-Man, approaching Axia's center. The Freedom Fighters and the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm also help defeat Kang, despite losing to his attacks. Cassie is able to get the best of M.O.D.O.K. and tells Cross that he has the capacity to change and does not have to be a \"dick\" all his life. \n \n \n \n \n \nKang\n and \nAnt-Man\n have a duel\n \n \nWith Ant-Man, the Wasp, and Stature attempting to battle Kang, Pym calls his ants (which had arrived in the Quantum Realm centuries before the humans and developed their own society) to distract him. Convinced he has been acting horribly, Cross sacrifices his life as a hero in disabling Kang's forcefield he had made, allowing the ants to attack him (with Lang uneasily declaring Cross an Avenger when Cross asks). Janet opens a portal back to \nEarth\n until Lang, the last person to return, was blasted away by Kang. Kang attempts to kill Lang in hand-to-hand combat, but is sucked in by the distorting Power Core by Hope's assistance. Looking back at the celebrating Freedom Fighters, Lang and van Dyne leave the Quantum Realm.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Lang-van Dyne family celebrate\n \n \nNow back home, Lang continues his happy life and orchestrates a fake surprise birthday for Cassie due to him missing so many. Lang briefly reflects on Kang's words and worries that he may not be dead or the door might now be open to the ones who exiled him, but decides not to dwell on that for now and focus on his extended family. The Lang and van Dyne families then celebrate a belated birthday dinner.\nBelieving the exiled Kang has died, the Council of Kangs calls every Kang variant in the \nMultiverse\n. They discuss that the Avengers may have to be dealt with as not only are they touching the very fabric of the Multiverse, but they were even able to seemingly kill one of their own. \n \n \n \n \n \nLoki\n spots \nVictor Timely\n \n \nIn the \n19th Century\n, \nLoki\n attends a presentation about time with \nMobius M.
