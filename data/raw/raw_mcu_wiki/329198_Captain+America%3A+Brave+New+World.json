After meeting with newly elected U.S. President Thaddeus Ross, Sam finds himself in the middle of an international incident. He must discover the reason behind a nefarious global plot before the true mastermind has the entire world seeing red.[1] Plot[] Captain America confronts SERPENT soldiers Despite his past controversies regarding the Duel of Harlem in 2010, newly elected United States president Thaddeus Ross held his victory speech sixteen years later, promising a cooperative means to overcome global threats. In 2027, he sends Sam Wilson and Lieutenant Joaqun Torres, known by their recently acquired mantles Captain America and Falcon respectively, on a mission in Oaxaca, Mexico to stop SERPENT's illegal sale of adamantium. Ordering Navy SEALs to secure the metal, Captain America storms the Catedral de Santo Ramos to rescue hostages from SERPENT leader Seth Voelker, codenamed Sidewinder, who urged them to reveal the organization's buyer's whereabouts. Falcon intercepts SERPENT's escape attempt and retrieves the stolen canister containing adamantium while Captain America faces SERPENT member Copperhead. Sam Wilson conversates with Isaiah Bradley Visiting his late wife's grave, Ross confides in his Head of Security Leila Taylor that his daughter Betty doubts his reform, stating his first hundred days will define him. After the operation, Torres asks Wilson for training, leading them to a session with Isaiah Bradley in Baltimore, Maryland. Bradley exits when Wilson takes a call from Ross, later admitting his unease with Wilson's loyalty to the president. Wilson reassures him the perception of the Captain America title will remain intact and that Taylor will monitor Ross for him. He reveals Ross invited him to a summit at the White House, with an invitation extended to Bradley, which he accepted. Thaddeus Ross holds his summit At the White House, Wilson meets Ross in the Blue Room, where Ross reveals plans to reform the Avengers, believing the team essential despite previously passing the Sokovia Accords in 2016. After posing with Japanese Prime Minister Ozaki, Ross, in response to the now-recovered Japanese sample of adamantium taken from Celestial Island, proposes a treaty to regulate adamantium mining and distribution. The summit meeting is disrupted by Bradley's sudden attempt to assassinate Ross. Utterly confused, he is arrested after fleeing toward Pershing Park. Wilson later confronts Ross and his security advisor Ruth Bat-Seraph, demanding permission to investigate. Ignoring Ross' orders, he pursues the case despite Taylor's attempts to reason with him. Sidewinder attacks Sam Wilson Leaving Joint Base AnacostiaBolling after visiting an incarcerated Bradley, who pleads for him to stay out of it, Wilson calls Torres, who analyzes White House CCTV footage, discovering the assassins' phones emitted flashing lights, suggesting mind control. Bat-Seraph does the same. Concluding SERPENT's buyer orchestrated these events, Wilson is ambushed by Sidewinder, who was promised double pay to eliminate him. After defeating Sidewinder, Wilson picks up a call from the buyer, who congratulates him and warns of what's next. Meanwhile, Ross reassures Prime Minister Kapur and the French president that Japan will join the treaty. \"Leader\" appears before Sam Wilson and Joaqun Torres Wilson and Torres track Sidewinder's last call to Camp Echo One, a military prison in Green Bank, West Virginia. Meanwhile, Bat-Seraph fails to prevent Sergeant Payumo's suicide after he murders the other assassins. En route to Tokyo, Japan, Ross realizes SERPENT's buyer is Samuel Sterns, whom he imprisoned after the Duel of Harlem. Sterns vows to destroy Ross' legacy. As Bat-Seraph transfers Bradley to solitary confinement, Wilson and Torres infiltrate Camp Echo One, finding a laboratory where Wilson finds pills prescribed to Ross. With Sterns' use of mind control confirmed, he reveals himself, denying his assumed efforts to kill Ross. Exposed to Bruce Banner's irratiated blood that affected his brain structure, he elaborates that he was forced to solve Ross' dilemmas for sixteen years. Making his escape, he unleashes brainwashed soldiers on Wilson and Torres, who, with Bat-Seraph's help, defeat them. They afterwards head to a training facility in Norfolk, Virginia, where Sidewinder is detained. Captain America and Falcon rush to neutralize rogue Navy pilots As Ross travels to Celestial Island to secure adamantium before Japan does, Sidewinder informs Wilson of Sterns' plot to incite U.S.-Japan tensions and tarnish Ross' legacy. Wilson's military friend Dennis Dunphy warns him of Ross approaching Celestial Island on the USS Milius, flanked by Japanese warships. Wilson and Torres suit up toward Celestial Island. Telling Ross of Sterns' capability to control minds, Wilson pressures Ross into admitting why he repeatedly visited the military prison according to Sterns' files: Sterns developed pills to prolong Ross' life and was in turn promised to be freed. At risk of losing the pills, Ross kept him incarcerated as to secure the chance of speaking to Betty again. After one of two brainwashed United States Navy pilots fired at Japanese jets, Captain America and Falcon attempt to intercept the planes while trying to convince Japan to stand down. While Sterns tries to enrage Ross, who realizes his pills were poisoned, Falcon is shot down by a rogue pilot. Captain America manages to neutralize both pilots. Red Hulk destroys the White House Torres is hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Wilson is comforted by Bucky Barnes. Ross holds a press conference in Washington, D.C. after planning to meet up with Betty. The conference is hijacked by Sterns after he prevented Dunphy from telling Wilson the pills contain gamma radiation and leaks his phone call with Ross. Wilson rushes to the conference after he is intercepted by Sterns. They bet on Ross' change of ways before Sterns was arrested by the Navy. Overwhelmed by reporters and unable to explain himself, Ross transforms into Red Hulk, destroying the White House as he expresses his rage. Captain America lures him to East Potomac Park, invoking his past walks with Betty. Red Hulk is unfazed and resumes battle. Captain America uses his Vibranium wings to subdue him but rises from the debris of the destroyed road. Approaching Captain America, Red Hulk is calmed when his desire to change and improve is acknowledged by him, proving it to everyone by reverting to his normal self. Thaddeus Ross is visited by Betty Ross With Bradley exonerated and the treaty, known as the Ozaki-Ross Accords, ratified, Wilson payed a visit to Ross, who resigned and is now imprisoned at the Raft. Querying his presence concerning their differences, Wilson explains to Ross they must see the good in each other. Wilson leaves so Betty can speak with her father. At the hospital, Torres apologizes to Wilson for his mistakes, acknowledging the way Wilson is constantly focused as opposed to him. Wilson elaborated that his focus comes with pressure, but Wilson replied that he wanted to feel the same strain and responsibilities, as he aspires to be just like him. Wilson assures him he'll need the suit again once he heals. Somewhat facetiously, an excited Torres suggests he get an upgrade from the Wakandan Design Group. Leader warns Sam Wilson of a looming threat Wilson later returns to the Raft to meet Sterns. Wilson quips he won their bet, but Sterns is unimpressed. He thusly notes they don't share the same humor, to which Sterns replied they do share the same world, which he claims Wilson would die to protect. Warning Wilson that a highly probable threat from worlds beyond theirs looms, Sterns curiously awaits Wilson's response when the time comes.
