After meeting with newly elected \nU.S.\n President \nThaddeus Ross\n, Sam finds himself in the middle of an \ninternational incident\n. He must discover the reason behind a nefarious \nglobal\n \nplot\n before the true \nmastermind\n has the entire world seeing red.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n confronts \nSERPENT\n soldiers\n \n \nDespite his past controversies regarding the \nDuel of Harlem\n in \n2010\n, newly elected \nUnited States\n president \nThaddeus Ross\n held his victory speech \nsixteen years later\n, promising a cooperative means to overcome global threats. In \n2027\n, he sends \nSam Wilson\n and Lieutenant \nJoaqun Torres\n, known by their recently acquired mantles Captain America and Falcon respectively, on a mission in \nOaxaca\n, \nMexico\n to stop \nSERPENT\n's illegal sale of \nadamantium\n. Ordering \nNavy SEALs\n to secure the metal, Captain America storms the \nCatedral de Santo Ramos\n to rescue hostages from SERPENT leader \nSeth Voelker\n, codenamed Sidewinder, who urged them to reveal the organization's buyer's whereabouts. Falcon intercepts SERPENT's escape attempt and retrieves the stolen canister containing adamantium while Captain America faces SERPENT member \nCopperhead\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSam Wilson\n conversates with \nIsaiah Bradley\n \n \nVisiting his \nlate wife\n's grave, Ross confides in his Head of Security \nLeila Taylor\n that his daughter \nBetty\n doubts his reform, stating his first hundred days will define him. After the operation, Torres asks Wilson for training, leading them to a session with \nIsaiah Bradley\n in \nBaltimore\n, \nMaryland\n. Bradley exits when Wilson takes a call from Ross, later admitting his unease with Wilson's loyalty to the president. Wilson reassures him the perception of the Captain America title will remain intact and that Taylor will monitor Ross for him. He reveals Ross invited him to a \nsummit\n at the \nWhite House\n, with an invitation extended to Bradley, which he accepted.\n \n \n \n \n \nThaddeus Ross\n holds his \nsummit\n \n \nAt the White House, Wilson meets Ross in the \nBlue Room\n, where Ross reveals plans to reform the \nAvengers\n, believing the team essential despite previously passing the \nSokovia Accords\n in \n2016\n. After posing with \nJapanese\n Prime Minister \nOzaki\n, Ross, in response to the now-recovered Japanese sample of adamantium taken from \nCelestial Island\n, proposes a treaty to regulate adamantium mining and distribution. The \nsummit meeting\n is disrupted by Bradley's sudden attempt to assassinate Ross. Utterly confused, he is arrested after fleeing toward \nPershing Park\n. Wilson later confronts Ross and his security advisor \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n, demanding permission to investigate. Ignoring Ross' orders, he pursues the case despite Taylor's attempts to reason with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSidewinder\n attacks \nSam Wilson\n \n \nLeaving \nJoint Base AnacostiaBolling\n after visiting an incarcerated Bradley, who pleads for him to stay out of it, Wilson calls Torres, who analyzes White House CCTV footage, discovering the assassins' phones emitted flashing lights, suggesting mind control. Bat-Seraph does the same. Concluding SERPENT's buyer orchestrated these events, Wilson is ambushed by Sidewinder, who was promised double pay to eliminate him. After defeating Sidewinder, Wilson picks up a call from the buyer, who congratulates him and warns of what's next. Meanwhile, Ross reassures Prime Minister \nKapur\n and the \nFrench president\n that Japan will join the treaty.\n \n \n \n \n \n\"\nLeader\n\" appears before \nSam Wilson\n and \nJoaqun Torres\n \n \nWilson and Torres track Sidewinder's last call to \nCamp Echo One\n, a military prison in \nGreen Bank\n, \nWest Virginia\n. Meanwhile, Bat-Seraph fails to prevent Sergeant \nPayumo\n's suicide after he murders the other assassins. En route to \nTokyo\n, \nJapan\n, Ross realizes SERPENT's buyer is \nSamuel Sterns\n, whom he imprisoned after the Duel of Harlem. Sterns vows to destroy Ross' legacy. As Bat-Seraph transfers Bradley to solitary confinement, Wilson and Torres infiltrate Camp Echo One, finding a laboratory where Wilson finds \npills\n prescribed to Ross. With Sterns' use of mind control confirmed, he reveals himself, denying his assumed efforts to kill Ross. Exposed to \nBruce Banner\n's \nirratiated\n blood that affected his brain structure, he elaborates that he was forced to solve Ross' dilemmas for sixteen years. Making his escape, he unleashes brainwashed soldiers on Wilson and Torres, who, with Bat-Seraph's help, defeat them. They afterwards head to a \ntraining facility\n in \nNorfolk\n, \nVirginia\n, where Sidewinder is detained.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n and \nFalcon\n rush to neutralize rogue \nNavy\n \npil\nots\n \n \nAs Ross travels to Celestial Island to secure adamantium before Japan does, Sidewinder informs Wilson of Sterns' plot to incite U.S.-Japan tensions and tarnish Ross' legacy. Wilson's military friend \nDennis Dunphy\n warns him of Ross approaching Celestial Island on the \nUSS \nMilius\n, flanked by Japanese warships. Wilson and Torres suit up toward Celestial Island. Telling Ross of Sterns' capability to control minds, Wilson pressures Ross into admitting why he repeatedly visited the military prison according to Sterns' files: Sterns developed pills to prolong Ross' life and was in turn promised to be freed. At risk of losing the pills, Ross kept him incarcerated as to secure the chance of speaking to Betty again. After one of two brainwashed \nUnited States Navy\n \npil\nots\n fired at Japanese jets, Captain America and Falcon attempt to intercept the planes while trying to convince Japan to stand down. While Sterns tries to enrage Ross, who realizes his pills were poisoned, Falcon is shot down by a rogue pilot. Captain America manages to neutralize both pilots.\n \n \n \n \n \nRed Hulk\n destroys the \nWhite House\n \n \nTorres is hospitalized at \nWalter Reed National Military Medical Center\n, where Wilson is comforted by \nBucky Barnes\n. Ross holds a press conference in \nWashington, D.C.\n after planning to meet up with Betty. The conference is hijacked by Sterns after he prevented Dunphy from telling Wilson the pills contain \ngamma radiation\n and leaks his phone call with Ross. Wilson rushes to the conference after he is intercepted by Sterns. They bet on Ross' change of ways before Sterns was arrested by the Navy. Overwhelmed by reporters and unable to explain himself, Ross transforms into Red Hulk, destroying the White House as he expresses his rage. Captain America lures him to \nEast Potomac Park\n, invoking his past walks with Betty. Red Hulk is unfazed and resumes battle. Captain America uses his \nVibranium\n \nwings\n to subdue him but rises from the debris of the destroyed road. Approaching Captain America, Red Hulk is calmed when his desire to change and improve is acknowledged by him, proving it to everyone by reverting to his normal self.\n \n \n \n \n \nThaddeus Ross\n is visited by \nBetty Ross\n \n \nWith Bradley exonerated and the treaty, known as the \nOzaki-Ross Accords\n, ratified, Wilson payed a visit to Ross, who resigned and is now imprisoned at the \nRaft\n. Querying his presence concerning their differences, Wilson explains to Ross they must see the good in each other. Wilson leaves so Betty can speak with her father. At the hospital, Torres apologizes to Wilson for his mistakes, acknowledging the way Wilson is constantly focused as opposed to him. Wilson elaborated that his focus comes with pressure, but Wilson replied that he wanted to feel the same strain and responsibilities, as he aspires to be just like him. Wilson assures him he'll need the suit again once he heals. Somewhat facetiously, an excited Torres suggests he get an upgrade from the \nWakandan Design Group\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLeader\n warns \nSam Wilson\n of a looming threat\n \n \nWilson later returns to the Raft to meet Sterns. Wilson quips he won their bet, but Sterns is unimpressed. He thusly notes they don't share the same humor, to which Sterns replied they do share the same world, which he claims Wilson would die to protect. Warning Wilson that a highly probable threat from \nworlds beyond theirs\n looms, Sterns curiously awaits Wilson's response when the time comes.\nCast\n[\n]\nAnthony Mackie\n as \nSam Wilson/Captain America\nDanny Ramirez\n as Lieutenant \nJoaqun Torres/Falcon\nShira Haas\n as Agent \nRuth Bat-Seraph\nCarl Lumbly\n as \nIsaiah Bradley\nXosha Roquemore\n as Agent \nLeila Taylor\nJhannes Haukur Jhannesson\n as \nDavis Lawfers/Copperhead\nWilliam Mark McCullough\n as Commander \nDennis Dunphy\nGiancarlo Esposito\n as \nSeth Voelker/Sidewinder\nLiv Tyler\n as Doctor \nBetty Ross\nTim Blake Nelson\n as \nSamuel Sterns/Leader\nHarrison Ford\n as President \nThaddeus Ross/Red Hulk\nSebastian Stan\n as \nBucky Barnes\nTakehiro Hira\n as Prime Minister \nOzaki\nHarsh Nayyar\n as Prime Minister \nKapur\nRick Espaillat\n as \nFrench President\nTodd Allen Durkin\n as \nSenior Advisor #1\nDustin Lewis\n as \nSenior Advisor #2\nRachael Markarian\n as President Aide #1\nPhuong Kubacki\n as President Aide #2\nAlan Boell\n as Sergeant \nPayumo\nAva Hill\n as \nRed Hulk Reporter\nMarissa Chanel Hampton\n as \nRose Garden Reporter\nKaterina Eichenberger\n as \nRose Garden Reporter\nMark Pettit\n as \nRose Garden Reporter\nJohn Mark Bowman\n as \nStill Cameraman\nKatina Rankin\n as Hospital Reporter\nJohn Cihangir\n as \nJackal\nEric Mbanda\n as \nWhiskey\nKoji Nishiyama\n as \nYamamoto\nDavid Atkinson\n as \nCommander\nJohn N.
