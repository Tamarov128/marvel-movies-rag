While investigating the aircraft's interior, two of the researchers discover a frozen, \ncircular object\n with a red, white and blue motif. \n \n \n \n \n \nJohann Schmidt\n begins hunting down the \nTesseract\n \n \nIn March \n1942\n, \nHYDRA\n forces led by \nJohann Schmidt\n invade a stone church in \nTnsberg\n, \nNorway\n, seeking a mysterious cosmic artifact known as the \nTesseract\n, which possesses untold powers. Upon discovering the true Tesseract, Schmidt has the \nChurch Keeper\n who guarded it killed, along with everyone else in the village.\n \n \n \n \n \nSteve Rogers\n speaks to \nBucky Barnes\n at \nStark Expo\n \n \nIn \n1943\n, \nSteve Rogers\n is once again rejected for military duty on the battlefields of \nWorld War II\n, despite making multiple attempts at different enlistment offices, due to his frail physical appearance and numerous health issues. While attending \nStark Expo\n with \nBucky Barnes\n, Rogers attempts to enlist again. After overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, \nAbraham Erskine\n allows Rogers to enlist as a candidate of \nProject Rebirth\n, a \"super-soldier\" experiment being conducted by the \nStrategic Scientific Reserve\n under the supervision of Erskine, \nChester Phillips\n, and \nPeggy Carter\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSteve Rogers\n begins his training for \nWorld War II\n in \nCamp Lehigh\n \n \nDuring basic training, Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered negative side-effects due to his inner ambition for power and obsession with becoming a \"superior man\". However, he reassures Rogers that he chose him because he believed Rogers was an inherently good man and one that, because he had been weak his whole life, would not lose respect for the strength he would gain. Back in \nEurope\n, Schmidt and \nArnim Zola\n, using one of his \nmachines\n, successfully harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions. Meanwhile, Schmidt, having discovered Erskine's location, dispatches an assassin to kill him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSteve Rogers\n stepping out after \nProject Rebirth\n \n \nIn New York City, Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, putting him in a special chamber where he is injected with the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n and dosed with \n\"vita-rays\"\n. Rogers emerges from the chamber taller and with an enhanced physique. After witnessing the success of the experiment, one of the attendees reveals himself to be Schmidt's assassin, \nHeinz Kruger\n, who shoots Erskine, killing him. Kruger grabs the last vial of the Super-Soldier Serum and escapes the facility into the streets of New York. Rogers runs after Kruger, using his new strength and stamina to run down Kruger's car on foot. Despite attempting to escape in a \nsubmarine\n, Rogers manages to catch Kruger, but the vial of Super Soldier Serum is broken in the process and the assassin immediately commits suicide by \ncyanide pill\n before he can be interrogated for information.\n \n \n \n \n \nSteve Rogers\n tours America as \nCaptain America\n \n \nWith Erskine dead and the super-soldier formula lost, the SSR is ordered to join the war and engage HYDRA directly; however, Philips decides to leave Rogers behind and allow scientists to study him in an attempt to rediscover Erskine's formula. Senator \nBrandt\n approaches Rogers and instead offers him the chance to tour the nation for the USO to promote war donations, using his image as the strong, ideal soldier as a symbol for the public to rally behind, which Rogers accepts. During his work for the USO Rogers perform in \nscripted stage shows\n as the star-spangled character \"Captain America\". As Rogers continues touring across the country Captain America gains great popularity among the public, leading to increasingly more elaborate shows as well as making appearances in \nfilm strips\n, \ncomic books\n, and other memorabilia. Although Rogers is happy to be contributing towards the war effort, he grows increasing weary of being paraded around while not being able to have a more direct role alongside those actively fighting.\n \n \n \n \n \nJohann Schmidt\n prepares to unleash his new weapon\n \n \nMeanwhile, Schmidt unveils his new \nTesseract-powered weaponry\n to \nthree\n \nNazi\n \nofficers\n sent to oversee his operation but uses the weapon to kill the officers after they realize that Germany is among a list of Schmidt's intended targets. Schmidt uses this moment to declare his secession from the \nThird Reich\n, claiming that HYDRA could grow no further in \nAdolf Hitler\n's shadow and will now follow his agenda. HYDRA continued to siphon energy from the Tesseract, using the stored energy to create a variety of weapons and integrated it into a range of vehicles and other technology, quickly giving the faction the potential to become a major threat to the war front, and the world at large.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n and \nBucky Barnes\n are confronted by \nRed Skull\n \n \nIn November 1943, while performing for active servicemen as well as encountering his colleagues from the SSR, Rogers learns that Barnes' \nunit\n was lost in a battle against HYDRA. Despite Philips insistence on the futility of the situation, Rogers refuses to believe that Barnes is dead and becomes determined to mount a solo rescue attempt, receiving help from Carter and \nHoward Stark\n, who fly him behind enemy lines. Rogers manages to sneak into HYDRA's \nmain factory\n where he finds and frees most of the captive soldiers who begin a riot and start escaping while Rogers continues on to find Barnes, who he discovers in a separate room where he was being operated on.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n reporting to \nColonel Phillips\n after rescuing the \n107th Infantry Regiment\n from captivity\n \n \nSchmidt, seeing the prisoners escaping and Rogers moving through the facility, sets the factory to self-destruct to cover HYDRA's operations and evacuate to another facility. As the building begins to detonate, Schmidt confronts Rogers on a high catwalk where he makes light of his similarities to Rogers following their mutual use of the super soldier serum. Schmidt expresses his belief that they have risen above the visage of normal humans before revealing his face to be a mask, removing it to display the red, skull-like face that earned him the sobriquet \"the Red Skull\". Schmidt and Zola make their escape while Rogers leads Barnes to the roof where they both barely manage to escape the factory themselves before regrouping with the escaped soldiers and marching back to base.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n and the \nHowling Commandos\n attack \nHYDRA\n Facilities\n \n \nFollowing the liberation of the Allied prisoners, Rogers gains his superior officers respect and acknowledgment as a soldier and is given high rank and the chance to fight as Captain America, as a key figure on the war front opposing HYDRA directly. Rogers recruits Barnes, \nDum Dum Dugan\n, \nGabe Jones\n, \nJim Morita\n, \nJames Montgomery Falsworth\n and \nJacques Dernier\n as his personal team of \nHowling Commandos\n to take out the other known HYDRA operations. Howard Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, including a durable, custom \ncombat uniform\n and a circular \nshield\n made of \nvibranium\n. For the next two years, Rogers and his \nHowling Commandos\n lead a strong offensive, sabotaging various HYDRA operations, much to Schmidt's frustration.\n \n \n \n \n \nBucky Barnes\n falls off the train\n \n \nIn \n1945\n, the team later assaults a \ntrain\n carrying Zola. Rogers and Barnes engage in a fight with the soldiers on the train, during which Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death, while Jones locates Zola on the train and captures him. Rogers is deeply affected by the loss of his best friend and is convinced by Carter to use his sorrow as motivation to put an end to HYDRA for good. Using information extracted from Zola, the final \nHYDRA stronghold\n is located and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on the \nUnited States\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSteve Rogers\n taking over control of the \nValkyrie\n \n \nRogers climbs aboard the \nValkyrie\n, HYDRA's massive aircraft bomber, as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, a machine containing the Tesseract is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, which opens a wormhole into space, sucking him into it in bright light. The cube falls to the floor, burning through the plane and falling into the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers instead crashes it on the Arctic shelf while making a sorrowful goodbye to Carter, making a promise to take her dancing, knowing he would never be able to make the date. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers' body or Schmidt's aircraft.\n \n \n \n \n \nNick Fury\n greets an awake \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nRogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an anachronistic radio broadcast that he was out of place, he flees outside into what is revealed to be \npresent-day\n Times Square, where \nNick Fury\n tells him he has been \"asleep\" for nearly 70 years. Stunned by this revelation, Rogers' only response is that he had a date.\nA year later\n, Fury approaches Rogers, proposing a \nmission\n with worldwide ramifications.\nCast\n[\n]\nChris Evans\n as \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n / \"\nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n\"\nHayley Atwell\n as Agent \nPeggy Carter\nSebastian Stan\n as Sergeant \nBucky Barnes\nTommy Lee Jones\n as Colonel \nChester Phillips\nHugo Weaving\n as \nJohann Schmidt/Red Skull\nDominic Cooper\n as \nHoward Stark\nRichard Armitage\n as \nHeinz Kruger\nStanley Tucci\n as Doctor \nAbraham Erskine\nSamuel L.
