His days as the morally flexible mercenary, Deadpool, behind him. When his \nhomeworld\n faces an existential threat, Wade must reluctantly \nsuit-up\n again with an even more reluctantlier reluctanter? Reluctantest? He must convince a reluctant \nWolverine\n to \nFuck\n. Synopses are so fucking stupid.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWade Wilson\n at his birthday party\n \n \nArriving at the \nSacred Timeline\n in the year \n2018\n, \nWade Wilson\n meets with \nHappy Hogan\n, trying to apply for the \nAvengers\n. Wilson is desperate to find a proper use for his abilities and get his life together, but Hogan is not impressed. He cites Wilson's problems with teamwork and tells him that one joins the Avengers not because he needs it, but because others need him. Wilson gets rejected, quits his life as Deadpool and starts working as a car salesman at \nDrive Max\n, while \nVanessa Carlysle\n breaks up with him. \nSix years later\n in \nhis universe\n, his friends threw him a birthday party, where he thanks everyone for sticking up with him, but suddenly, the \nTime Variance Authority\n agents arrive at \nWilson's apartment\n and capture him.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n learns of \nMr. Paradox\n's plan\n \n \nMr. Paradox\n meets Wilson at the \nTime Variance Authority Office\n and offers him a proper place on the Sacred Timeline with the Avengers. Wilson is excited about his long-awaited \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n debut and suits up as Deadpool once again, eager to share the news with his friends. However, Paradox explains that his universe is on the brink of dying due to losing an Anchor Being that held his reality together, said Anchor Being \nWolverine\n who died protecting \nX-23\n. Paradox also expresses his dissatisfaction with the current leadership of the TVA and adds that he is planning to speed up the destruction of Wilson's universe by using the \nTime Ripper\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n attempts to recruit \nLogan\n \n \nHorrified that he is about to lose his home and friends, Deadpool goes against the TVA and decides to find Wolverine and save his universe. Stealing a \nTemPad\n, Deadpool exhumes Wolverine's grave but finds out that he is completely dead, before \nfighting off\n the \nMinutemen\n pursuing him. Deadpool keeps searches for Wolverine variants across the \nMultiverse\n to replace the deceased one, but most of them are either too hostile or are not suitable enough, with the exception of one he meets at a bar in Canada. \nWolverine\n is not interested in hearing Deadpool out, but eventually gets too drunk to fight him and passes out. Deadpool brings the unconscious Wolverine to the TVA, but Paradox only laughs at him, saying that not only is replacing an Anchor Being impossible, but also that he managed to bring the worst Wolverine variant to ever exist.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n are confronted by \nSabretooth\n \n \nDeadpool finds out that Paradox is acting without the TVA's authorization, but both he and Wolverine get pruned and sent to the \nVoid\n, where Wolverine comes to his senses and attacks Deadpool. The two fight for some time, until Deadpool tells Wolverine that if they make it back to the TVA, they could change his past and prevent the catastrophe that happened to him. Wolverine begrudgingly agrees, before they meet \nJohnny Storm\n, whom Deadpool assumes to be \nCaptain America\n, as well as a \ngroup of rogue scavengers\n, led by \nSabretooth\n. \nPyro\n depowers Storm and Wolverine kills Sabertooth, however, Pyro and \nToad\n manage to capture all three of them and bring them along with a Minuteman to their \nbase\n in the giant corpse of \nAnt-Man\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nCassandra Nova\n introduces herself to \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n \n \nDeadpool and Wolverine get introduced to \nCassandra Nova\n, a twin sister of \nCharles Xavier\n who was banished to the Void by the TVA, to her own satisfaction. Deadpool claims that while they were being transported to the camp, Storm repeatedly insulted Nova and despite him denying it, she kills Storm by skinning him with her telekinesis. Nova then incapacitates Wolverine and forcefully gets into Deadpool's mind, hijacking his memories of Carlysle to tell him that he will always be nobody. Deadpool and Wolverine recover and attack Nova, but she effortlessly brushes them off and leaves them to be devoured by \nAlioth\n, although they manage to escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n tells \nWolverine\n he needs to save his friends\n \n \nThey decide to find the \nResistance\n that Storm mentioned and get out of the Void, while Deadpool keeps badgering Wolverine about his \nsuit\n and why keeps wearing it. On their way, they meet two Deadpool variants, \nDogpool\n and her owner \nNicepool\n. Despite Deadpool's antagonism towards Nicepool, the latter gives them directions to the Void's borderlands and provides them with a \ncar\n to make it there. While driving, Deadpool accidentally slips up that he is not certain that the TVA will fix Wolverine's reality, admitting that he made an \"educated wish\". Wolverine is enraged and lashes out at Deadpool, which results in both of them fighting each other until both are too exhausted, and someone drives their car to the \nHero Hideout\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n meets the \nResistance\n \n \nThere, they meet \nElektra\n, \nBlade\n, and \nGambit\n variants, led by X-23 who had been banished to the Void by the TVA. Deadpool convinces the Resistance to team up and take on Nova and avenge Storm's death, while leaving out the reason why he died. Wolverine scoffs that their plan is doomed to fail and refuses to join them, so X-23 goes to talk to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nWolverine\n reflects on his past\n \n \nWolverine admits that in \nhis universe\n, he abandoned his fellow \nX-Men\n, which resulted in them being killed by the anti-mutant vigilantes, much to his horror and despair, so he keeps wearing the X-Man suit since then. X-23 tells Wolverine that regardless of what he thinks about himself, he is still a good person at heart and always will be. Meanwhile, Pyro follows Deadpool and Wolverine's tracks and strikes a deal with Paradox, who decides that Nova is too dangerous and must be eliminated.\n \n \n \n \n \nNova\n meets \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n again\n \n \nWith Wolverine joining them, the Resistance storms Nova's base, planning to acquire \nJuggernaut\n's \nhelmet\n to neutralize Nova's psychic ability. Nova knocks Deadpool out and subdues Wolverine, taking over his mind and urges him to give in to his primal instincts and let himself loose, promising to shut down his trauma. However, Wolverine rejects her and Deadpool puts Juggernaut's helmet provided by X-23 on her, rendering her completely powerless, demanding her to release them from the Void. Suddenly, Nova gets shot by Pyro and Wolverine tells Deadpool to take off the helmet and save her, claiming that the \nCharles Xavier\n he knew would never want him to let Nova die.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n return to \nEarth-10005\n \n \nAs Deadpool obliges, Nova relents and uses a \nSling Ring\n having the \nReality\n and \nTime\n Stones attached to it to open an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n out of the Void, so he and Wolverine can escape right before Alioth devours the whole base. Nova then forces Pyro to admit that he tried to kill her on Paradox's orders, despite them having a prior agreement about her. Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Earth-10005, where Paradox finishes preparing the Time Ripper, and Nova follows suit, killing Pyro afterwards. Nova tells them that she intends to use the Time Ripper and turn the whole Multiverse into the Void that she loves so much, capturing Paradox and sending the \nDeadpool Corps\n to stop Deadpool and Wolverine.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n confront the \nDeadpool Corps\n \n \nDeadpool and Wolverine fight through the hordes of Deadpool variants, who keep coming back due to their regeneration, however, they all cease fighting once they see \nPeter Wisdom\n, who is deeply loved by all Deadpools. With them distracted, Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Paradox who tells them that Nova already took control over the Time Ripper and is preparing to unravel the entire Multiverse. He tells them that the only way to stop this is to short-circuit the chambers of matter and anti-matter that power the device, however, it is all but guaranteed to kill them even with their regeneration. Wolverine says he should be the one to do it, claiming that he has nothing to fight for anymore, however, Deadpool locks him out of the bunker and prepares to sacrifice himself instead.\n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n emerge from the chamber alive\n \n \nDespite Wolverine's protests, Deadpool decides that he must do it himself to save everyone he loves, however, Wolverine breaks in and connects the chamber with him, resulting in the destruction of the Time Ripper and Nova's death. \nB-15\n and the TVA come to investigate the incident, with Paradox claiming that Nova is solely responsible while mourning the deaths of Deadpool and Wolverine, however, they manage to survive by sharing the energy burst between each other.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson\n talks with \nCarlysle\n \n \nParadox gets taken under custody and Deadpool asks B-15 to do good by their Resistance allies who were left in the Void and fix Wolverine's home reality. B-15 promises to consider the former but notes that Wolverine's unfortunate circumstances were what led him to save the Multiverse. Wilson and Logan sit down and rest, before having some shawarma and reuniting with Dogpool, now that Nicepool was killed in the battle. Wilson takes both of them to his place and introduces them to \nBlind Al\n, later, he invites all his friends, as well as \nX-23\n over to his place to hang out together and celebrate. During the celebrations, Logan encourages Wilson to rekindle his relationship with Carlysle. \n \n \n \n \n \nDeadpool\n defends himself\n \n \nIn a \npost-credits scene\n, Deadpool returns to the \nTime Variance Authority Office\n and pulls up the footage of Storm actually cursing out Nova, proving that he did not lie about what Storm said.\nCast\n[\n]\nRyan Reynolds\n as \nWade Wilson/Deadpool\n / \nWade Wilson/Nicepool\n / \nHimself\n \n(archive footage)\nHugh Jackman\n as \nLogan/Wolverine\n / \nLogan/Wolverine\n / \nLogan/Weapon X\n / \nLogan/Patch\n / \nLogan/Wolverine\n / \nLogan/Wolverine\n / \nLogan/Wolverine\n / \nLogan/Wolverine\n \n(archive footage)\nLuke Bennett\n as \nLogan/Wolverine\n \n(on-set)\n[\n2\n]\nEmma Corrin\n as \nCassandra Nova\nMatthew Macfadyen\n as \nMr. Paradox\nDafne Keen\n as \nX-23/Laura\nJon Favreau\n as \nHappy Hogan\nMorena Baccarin\n as \nVanessa Carlysle\n / \nCassandra Nova\n \n(illusion)\nRob Delaney\n as \nPeter Wisdom\nLeslie Uggams\n as \nBlind Al\nJennifer Garner\n as \nElektra\nWesley Snipes\n as \nEric Brooks/Blade\nChanning Tatum\n as \nRemy LeBeau/Gambit\nChris Evans\n as \nJohnny Storm/Human Torch\n / \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n \n(archive footage)\nHenry Cavill\n as \nLogan/Cavillrine\nWunmi Mosaku\n as \nB-15\nAaron Stanford\n as \nJohn Allerdyce/Pyro\nTyler Mane\n as \nVictor Creed/Sabretooth\nKaran Soni\n as \nDopinder\nBrianna Hildebrand\n as \nEllie Phimister/Negasonic Teenage Warhead\nShioli Kutsuna\n as \nYukio\nStefan Kapii\n as \nPiotr Rasputin/Colossus\nRandal Reeder\n as \nBuck\nLewis Tan\n as \nRusty/Shatterstar\nNick Pauley\n as \nWade Wilson/Dancepool\nSonita Henry\n as \nTammy Chipman\nRyan McKen\n as \nMr. Chipman\nNanak Phlora\n as \nElliot Chipman\nAydin Ahmed\n as \nKevin Chipman\nLeemore Marrett Jr.\n as Minuteman Leader\nJames Dryden\n as \nRalph\nOllie Palmer\n as Bar Patron\nGreg Hemphill\n as Seedy Bartender\nAaron W.
