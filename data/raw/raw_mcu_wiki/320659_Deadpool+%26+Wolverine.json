His days as the morally flexible mercenary, Deadpool, behind him. When his homeworld faces an existential threat, Wade must reluctantly suit-up again with an even more reluctantlier reluctanter? Reluctantest? He must convince a reluctant Wolverine to Fuck. Synopses are so fucking stupid.[1] Plot[] Wade Wilson at his birthday party Arriving at the Sacred Timeline in the year 2018, Wade Wilson meets with Happy Hogan, trying to apply for the Avengers. Wilson is desperate to find a proper use for his abilities and get his life together, but Hogan is not impressed. He cites Wilson's problems with teamwork and tells him that one joins the Avengers not because he needs it, but because others need him. Wilson gets rejected, quits his life as Deadpool and starts working as a car salesman at Drive Max, while Vanessa Carlysle breaks up with him. Six years later in his universe, his friends threw him a birthday party, where he thanks everyone for sticking up with him, but suddenly, the Time Variance Authority agents arrive at Wilson's apartment and capture him. Deadpool learns of Mr. Paradox's plan Mr. Paradox meets Wilson at the Time Variance Authority Office and offers him a proper place on the Sacred Timeline with the Avengers. Wilson is excited about his long-awaited Marvel Cinematic Universe debut and suits up as Deadpool once again, eager to share the news with his friends. However, Paradox explains that his universe is on the brink of dying due to losing an Anchor Being that held his reality together, said Anchor Being Wolverine who died protecting X-23. Paradox also expresses his dissatisfaction with the current leadership of the TVA and adds that he is planning to speed up the destruction of Wilson's universe by using the Time Ripper. Deadpool attempts to recruit Logan Horrified that he is about to lose his home and friends, Deadpool goes against the TVA and decides to find Wolverine and save his universe. Stealing a TemPad, Deadpool exhumes Wolverine's grave but finds out that he is completely dead, before fighting off the Minutemen pursuing him. Deadpool keeps searches for Wolverine variants across the Multiverse to replace the deceased one, but most of them are either too hostile or are not suitable enough, with the exception of one he meets at a bar in Canada. Wolverine is not interested in hearing Deadpool out, but eventually gets too drunk to fight him and passes out. Deadpool brings the unconscious Wolverine to the TVA, but Paradox only laughs at him, saying that not only is replacing an Anchor Being impossible, but also that he managed to bring the worst Wolverine variant to ever exist. Deadpool and Wolverine are confronted by Sabretooth Deadpool finds out that Paradox is acting without the TVA's authorization, but both he and Wolverine get pruned and sent to the Void, where Wolverine comes to his senses and attacks Deadpool. The two fight for some time, until Deadpool tells Wolverine that if they make it back to the TVA, they could change his past and prevent the catastrophe that happened to him. Wolverine begrudgingly agrees, before they meet Johnny Storm, whom Deadpool assumes to be Captain America, as well as a group of rogue scavengers, led by Sabretooth. Pyro depowers Storm and Wolverine kills Sabertooth, however, Pyro and Toad manage to capture all three of them and bring them along with a Minuteman to their base in the giant corpse of Ant-Man. Cassandra Nova introduces herself to Deadpool and Wolverine Deadpool and Wolverine get introduced to Cassandra Nova, a twin sister of Charles Xavier who was banished to the Void by the TVA, to her own satisfaction. Deadpool claims that while they were being transported to the camp, Storm repeatedly insulted Nova and despite him denying it, she kills Storm by skinning him with her telekinesis. Nova then incapacitates Wolverine and forcefully gets into Deadpool's mind, hijacking his memories of Carlysle to tell him that he will always be nobody. Deadpool and Wolverine recover and attack Nova, but she effortlessly brushes them off and leaves them to be devoured by Alioth, although they manage to escape. Deadpool tells Wolverine he needs to save his friends They decide to find the Resistance that Storm mentioned and get out of the Void, while Deadpool keeps badgering Wolverine about his suit and why keeps wearing it. On their way, they meet two Deadpool variants, Dogpool and her owner Nicepool. Despite Deadpool's antagonism towards Nicepool, the latter gives them directions to the Void's borderlands and provides them with a car to make it there. While driving, Deadpool accidentally slips up that he is not certain that the TVA will fix Wolverine's reality, admitting that he made an \"educated wish\". Wolverine is enraged and lashes out at Deadpool, which results in both of them fighting each other until both are too exhausted, and someone drives their car to the Hero Hideout. Deadpool meets the Resistance There, they meet Elektra, Blade, and Gambit variants, led by X-23 who had been banished to the Void by the TVA. Deadpool convinces the Resistance to team up and take on Nova and avenge Storm's death, while leaving out the reason why he died. Wolverine scoffs that their plan is doomed to fail and refuses to join them, so X-23 goes to talk to him. Wolverine reflects on his past Wolverine admits that in his universe, he abandoned his fellow X-Men, which resulted in them being killed by the anti-mutant vigilantes, much to his horror and despair, so he keeps wearing the X-Man suit since then. X-23 tells Wolverine that regardless of what he thinks about himself, he is still a good person at heart and always will be. Meanwhile, Pyro follows Deadpool and Wolverine's tracks and strikes a deal with Paradox, who decides that Nova is too dangerous and must be eliminated. Nova meets Deadpool and Wolverine again With Wolverine joining them, the Resistance storms Nova's base, planning to acquire Juggernaut's helmet to neutralize Nova's psychic ability. Nova knocks Deadpool out and subdues Wolverine, taking over his mind and urges him to give in to his primal instincts and let himself loose, promising to shut down his trauma. However, Wolverine rejects her and Deadpool puts Juggernaut's helmet provided by X-23 on her, rendering her completely powerless, demanding her to release them from the Void. Suddenly, Nova gets shot by Pyro and Wolverine tells Deadpool to take off the helmet and save her, claiming that the Charles Xavier he knew would never want him to let Nova die. Deadpool and Wolverine return to Earth-10005 As Deadpool obliges, Nova relents and uses a Sling Ring having the Reality and Time Stones attached to it to open an Inter-Dimensional Portal out of the Void, so he and Wolverine can escape right before Alioth devours the whole base. Nova then forces Pyro to admit that he tried to kill her on Paradox's orders, despite them having a prior agreement about her. Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Earth-10005, where Paradox finishes preparing the Time Ripper, and Nova follows suit, killing Pyro afterwards. Nova tells them that she intends to use the Time Ripper and turn the whole Multiverse into the Void that she loves so much, capturing Paradox and sending the Deadpool Corps to stop Deadpool and Wolverine. Deadpool and Wolverine confront the Deadpool Corps Deadpool and Wolverine fight through the hordes of Deadpool variants, who keep coming back due to their regeneration, however, they all cease fighting once they see Peter Wisdom, who is deeply loved by all Deadpools. With them distracted, Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Paradox who tells them that Nova already took control over the Time Ripper and is preparing to unravel the entire Multiverse. He tells them that the only way to stop this is to short-circuit the chambers of matter and anti-matter that power the device, however, it is all but guaranteed to kill them even with their regeneration. Wolverine says he should be the one to do it, claiming that he has nothing to fight for anymore, however, Deadpool locks him out of the bunker and prepares to sacrifice himself instead. Deadpool and Wolverine emerge from the chamber alive Despite Wolverine's protests, Deadpool decides that he must do it himself to save everyone he loves, however, Wolverine breaks in and connects the chamber with him, resulting in the destruction of the Time Ripper and Nova's death. B-15 and the TVA come to investigate the incident, with Paradox claiming that Nova is solely responsible while mourning the deaths of Deadpool and Wolverine, however, they manage to survive by sharing the energy burst between each other. Wilson talks with Carlysle Paradox gets taken under custody and Deadpool asks B-15 to do good by their Resistance allies who were left in the Void and fix Wolverine's home reality. B-15 promises to consider the former but notes that Wolverine's unfortunate circumstances were what led him to save the Multiverse. Wilson and Logan sit down and rest, before having some shawarma and reuniting with Dogpool, now that Nicepool was killed in the battle. Wilson takes both of them to his place and introduces them to Blind Al, later, he invites all his friends, as well as X-23 over to his place to hang out together and celebrate. During the celebrations, Logan encourages Wilson to rekindle his relationship with Carlysle. Deadpool defends himself In a post-credits scene, Deadpool returns to the Time Variance Authority Office and pulls up the footage of Storm actually cursing out Nova, proving that he did not lie about what Storm said.
