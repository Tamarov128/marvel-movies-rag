Make mistakes. Take chances. Because if theres one thing lifes taught me, theres always room to grow.\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nScott \nEdward Harris\n Lang\n is a former convicted thief who struggled to pay child support to his \nestranged wife\n with whom he had a daughter, \nCassie Lang\n. With the promise of money, he was convinced by \nHank Pym\n to take on the mantle of \nAnt-Man\n, a superhero with an advanced \nsuit\n designed to shrink its wearer to a tiny size while increasing one's toughness, agility, and physical strength. Trained under Pym and his daughter \nHope van Dyne\n, Ant-Man was to help foil Pym's former protege \nDarren Cross\n, who was intending to sell his \nYellowjacket Suit\n design and his copy of the \nPym Particles\n formula to \nHYDRA\n and the \nTen Rings\n. However, their plan was discovered by Cross, culminating in a \nfinal fight\n between Yellowjacket and Ant-Man. To defeat him, Ant-Man shrunk small enough to enter Yellowjacket's suit and destroy it, sending Ant-Man to the \nQuantum Realm\n, but he was able to escape. Ant-Man's heroism helped restore his relationship with Cassie and his ex-wife, as well as find a new romantic one with van Dyne. Lang soon learned that the \nAvengers\n were seeking for his help.\nAgainst Pym and van Dyne's wishes, Ant-Man joined \nCaptain America\n's side during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, having been recommended by the \nFalcon\n following their \nprevious encounter\n. Ant-Man \nfought\n against \nIron Man\n and his allies, allowing Captain America and \nWinter Soldier\n to escape. Ant-Man and several of his new allies were then arrested and imprisoned in the \nRaft\n by \nThaddeus Ross\n. When Captain America arrived to \nfree\n them, Ant-Man escaped, but later made a deal with the \nFBI\n to be put under house arrest so that he could still spend time with his family.\nThree days before Lang could finish his sentence, he had a strange vision of \nJanet van Dyne\n, who had remained trapped inside the \nQuantum Realm\n, and with whom Lang became psychically entangled with while he was there. This resulted in Lang being kidnapped by Pym and Hope van Dyne, who had built a \nQuantum Tunnel\n machine and intended to use it and Ant-Man to rescue Janet. These plans went awry when Ant-Man and Wasp were confronted by both \nGhost\n and \nSonny Burch\n, who wanted to steal the Quantum Tunnel machine for their own reasons. Ant-Man, Wasp, and Pym eventually succeeded in \nrescuing\n Janet from the Quantum Realm. Ant-Man was then able to return home just in time to finish his house arrest, narrowly avoiding an extended prison sentence for violating the terms.\nHowever, during a trip to the Quantum Realm to gather quantum particles for \nGhost\n, Ant-Man became trapped as Pym's entire family was \nturned to dust\n by \nThanos\n. Ant-Man was unable to escape until \n2023\n, where he regrouped with the \nAvengers\n and, realizing that time flowed differently in the Quantum Realm since he only experienced five hours while trapped, suggested that they use the Quantum Realm as a means of \ntime travel\n to the past. Ant-Man then officially joined the Avengers and participated in the \nTime Heist\n, where they successfully managed to acquire the six \nInfinity Stones\n from alternate pasts and used the Stones to \nresurrect\n the victims of Thanos' Snap. However, an alternate \nThanos\n had managed to follow the Avengers through time, and Ant-Man fought in the resulting \nBattle of Earth\n. Thanos and his army were eventually destroyed, after which Lang celebrated the victory with van Dyne and Cassie, and attended Tony Stark's funeral.\nNow famous to the public, Lang returned to the \nQuantum Realm\n when he and the rest of his family were accidentally pulled through a portal created by Cassie. Separated from the rest of the group, Lang and Cassie encountered the \nFreedom Fighters\n, and accidentally led \nM.O.D.O.K.\n, who revealed himself to be Cross, to their location. M.O.D.O.K captured the pair and brought them back to \nAxia\n to face \nKang the Conqueror\n. Kang threatened to kill Cassie if Lang did not retrieve the \nMultiversal Engine Core\n, so Lang was forced to comply. However, Kang was ultimately killed once the group inspired a full-on revolution by the people living under Kang's tyranny, but not without massive casualties, including Cross. Lang returned to his daily life, but started to become increasingly paranoid about a warning given to him by Kang about \na coming threat\n that only he could stop, leading Lang to question if killing him was the right decision.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nChildhood\n1.1.2\n \nCollege Years\n1.1.3\n \nRaising a Family\n1.1.4\n \nThe VistaCorp Job\n1.1.5\n \nPrison Sentence and Divorce\n1.1.6\n \nA Biased Interview\n1.2\n \nRelease from San Quentin\n1.2.1\n \nJob Search\n1.2.2\n \nUnwelcome Family Reunion\n1.2.3\n \nBreaking into Pym's Residence\n1.2.4\n \nTrials of the Suit\n1.2.5\n \nPrison Break\n1.2.6\n \nHank Pym's Mission\n1.3\n \nBecoming Ant-Man\n1.3.1\n \nBeginning Training\n1.3.2\n \nCombat Training\n1.3.3\n \nMeeting the Ants\n1.3.4\n \nBecoming One with the Ants\n1.3.5\n \nMission Planning\n1.3.6\n \nHank Pym's Confession\n1.3.7\n \nDuel at the Avengers Compound\n1.3.8\n \nComplicating the Plan\n1.3.9\n \nStealing the Yellowjacket\n1.3.10\n \nStopping Darren Cross\n1.3.11\n \nDuel at Jim Paxton's House\n1.3.12\n \nQuantum Realm\n1.3.13\n \nHeist Aftermath\n1.4\n \nSought by the Avengers\n1.4.1\n \nUpdated by Luis\n1.4.2\n \nRecruited by Captain America\n1.4.3\n \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n1.4.4\n \nGiant-Man Attacks\n1.4.5\n \nPrisoner of the Raft\n1.4.6\n \nEscape from the Raft\n1.5\n \nUnder House Arrest\n1.5.1\n \nOccupying Himself\n1.5.2\n \nReconnecting with Loved Ones\n1.5.3\n \nAlmost Free\n1.5.4\n \nKidnapped by Hope\n1.6\n \nReturning to Ant-Man\n1.6.1\n \nFirst Encounter with Ghost\n1.6.2\n \nMeeting Bill Foster\n1.6.3\n \nTricking Woo\n1.6.4\n \nChase for the Mobile Laboratory\n1.6.5\n \nFree Man Again\n1.6.6\n \nTrapped in the Quantum Realm\n1.7\n \nJoining the Avengers\n1.7.1\n \nEscape from the Quantum Realm\n1.7.2\n \nDiscussing the Quantum Realm\n1.7.3\n \nAsking For Assistance\n1.7.4\n \nTesting Time Travel\n1.7.5\n \nTesting the Time Suit\n1.8\n \nTime Heist\n1.8.1\n \nLocating the Infinity Stones\n1.8.2\n \nTheft of the Space Stone\n1.8.3\n \nBlip\n1.8.4\n \nAttack on the Avengers Compound\n1.8.5\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.8.6\n \nAftermath\n1.9\n \nRecognized Hero\n1.9.1\n \nFriendship with the Avengers\n1.9.2\n \nPublic Approval\n1.9.3\n \nGuest-Starring on Podcasts\n1.9.4\n \nWriting a Book\n1.9.5\n \nRetrospective with Luis\n1.9.6\n \nFamily Dinner\n1.10\n \nAdventure in the Quantum Realm\n1.10.1\n \nMeeting the Freedom Fighters\n1.10.2\n \nAttacked by M.O.D.O.K.\n1.10.3\n \nMeeting Kang the Conqueror\n1.10.4\n \nTheft of the Multiversal Engine Core\n1.10.5\n \nUprising in Axia\n1.10.6\n \nDefeating Kang the Conqueror\n1.10.7\n \nBack to Normal\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nOther Equipment\n4.2\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nFacilities\n5.1\n \nPrisons\n6\n \nRelationships\n6.1\n \nFamily\n6.2\n \nAllies\n6.3\n \nEnemies\n7\n \nAppearances\n8\n \nTrivia\n9\n \nBehind the Scenes\n10\n \nReferences\n11\n \nExternal Links\nBiography\n[\n]\nThis is an in-depth biography of Ant-Man. For an abridged overview, see \nMarvel Database's article on the same character\n.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nChildhood\n[\n]\n\"It's ironic. As a kid and a teenager, I was socially awkward, I would have killed for the power to shrink myself down to the point of invisibility.\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nDuring his childhood and into his teenage years, Scott Lang was a socially awkward kid. Lang was also a late bloomer, only hitting his growth spurt at the age of fourteen. Around this time, he was also the statistician for a basketball team. He also attempted to gain the affection of women by putting on far too much cologne.\n[\n7\n]\nCollege Years\n[\n]\n\"I mean, at least first don't speak. And what I really mean is, don't enter a new group shooting your yapper off. I made that mistake in college.\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nDuring his freshman year of college, Lang wanted to be known as the smartest guy around, so he never missed an opportunity to flex his knowledge. But this only made him socially isolated from his peers, much to his dismay. Lang later adapted, becoming much more charismatic and actually gaining friends in the process, although he still didn't have much luck finding a date.\n[\n7\n]\nRaising a Family\n[\n]\n\"Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only \ndaughter\n in the process.\"\n\nDarren Cross\n[src]\nLater in life, Lang had earned a master's degree in electrical engineering. With his skills, he would often steal from criminals and give back to those they had stolen from.\n[\n1\n]\n Lang married a woman named \nMaggie\n sometime before \n2008\n.\n[\n3\n]\n Maggie was very supportive of Lang, but disliked his robberies, albeit from criminals. The couple later had a daughter whom they named \nCassandra \"Cassie\" Lang\n. Wishing to support his own family, Lang promised his wife that he would stop stealing after Cassie's birth and took up a job at the security company \nVistaCorp\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThe VistaCorp Job\n[\n]\n\"You broke into the \nhome\n of your \nformer boss\n and stole four million dollars.\"\n\"No, no, no. I actually refunded four million dollars to customers \nVistaCorp\n was stealing from.\"\n\nChristine Everhart\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang breaking inside \nGeoff Zorick\n's \nMansion\n \n \nLang discovered that \nVistaCorp\n was overcharging its customers. At first, he thought it was simply a coding error and changed it. He then realized the company was intentionally doing this to their customers for financial gain when \nGeoff Zorick\n, ordered Lang to revert his many corrections before firing him. Angered by VistaCorp's larceny, Lang \nbroke\n into the \nVistaCorp Headquarters\n to hack their systems and pay back the money to VistaCorp's customers. He then broke into \nGeoff Zorick's Mansion\n and stole a few items before he got carried away and drove Zorick's car into the mansion's pool.\n[\n1\n]\nPrison Sentence and Divorce\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is arrested for his crimes\n \n \n\"When I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talking about cell block D, his \nwife\n had just filed for divorce.\"\n\nLuis\n[src]\nLang was arrested and given a three-year sentence in \nSan Quentin State Prison\n.\n[\n1\n]\n His arrest came at a tenuous part in the Langs' marriage which led them to get divorced following his incarceration, with \nMaggie\n eventually becoming engaged to \nJim Paxton\n.\n[\n7\n]\n Lang was reading the divorce papers when he was introduced to \nLuis\n, his cellmate. Luis felt bad for Lang and understood the situation. The two then became best friends.\n[\n4\n]\n In addition to \nLuis\n, Lang built up a friendly rapport with the prison's janitor, \nLenny\n, which helped give him hope during his bleak job. Lang used a similar strategy of friendliness towards his fellow inmates, which netted him the reputation of being \"The Guy\" at San Quentin.\n[\n7\n]\n During his time in prison, Lang vowed to never get involved in crime again and focus his attention on helping to raise \nCassie\n,\n[\n3\n]\n with Lang sending her comic books in the mail as a way to make up for the time he was missing with her. He also picked up gardening during his sentence, tending to his small dirt patch during his thirty-minute yard time.\n[\n7\n]\nA Biased Interview\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is interviewed by \nChristine Everhart\n \n \n\"I'm getting tired of your biased accusations. You know what, maybe I made a mistake. But I'm in here paying the price. Every step of the way, my name's been dragged through the mud by the media and now I'm locked away from my family and I'm the only one facing any consequences! That is pissing me off!!!\"\nScott Lang to \nChristine Everhart\n[src]\nA day before his release from \nSan Quentin State Prison\n, Lang was interviewed by \nChristine Everhart\n at \nWHiH World News\n. They talked about the reason behind his \nheist\n at \nVistaCorp\n; however, Lang felt that the news station was being unfair, due to VistaCorp being their parent company.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang being subdued by \none\n of the guards\n \n \nHis animosity towards the remarks made by the seemingly biased news anchor, caused him to slam his hand onto the desk in frustration, resulting in him getting tased by \npolice guard\n.\n[\n9\n]\nRelease from San Quentin\n[\n]\nJob Search\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang undergoes the prison's goodbye ritual\n \n \n\"I'm gonna miss you, Scott.\"\n\"Gonna miss you too, Peach. Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.\"\n\nPeachy\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nOn \nJuly 17, 2015\n, Lang was released for proper conduct during his stay in the \nSan Quentin State Prison\n. Before being pardoned, Lang underwent a traditional goodbye ritual where he fought an inmate called \nPeachy\n. Lang allowed Peachy to hit him hard across the jaw and successfully stayed on his feet, he then retaliated by hitting his friend in the stomach, which Peachy did not react to. Lang then attempted to distract Peachy and punched him, still failing to knock him down before he and the prisoners embraced.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is released from prison at long last\n \n \nHaving said his goodbyes, Lang was finally escorted out of prison, having been freed in the wake of \nrobbing\n \nVistaCorp\n and allowed to have his freedom at last. Being taken outside by two armed guards, Lang was then picked up by \nLuis\n. The pair happily embraced before Luis questioned how Lang had gained a cut across his eye, with Lang explaining it had come from Peachy while Luis recalled gaining his own scar from his goodbye punch from Peachy and boasting that he was the only one to ever knock him out with a single punch while they both got into his van to leave.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang catches up with \nLuis\n while driving\n \n \nAs they drove towards \nSan Francisco\n, Lang thanked his friend for coming all that way out to pick him up before asking how Luis' own relationship with his girlfriend was going, only for Luis to tell him that she had left him. Luis then informed Lang that much of his own life had gone bad, Luis' mother died and his father had gotten deported, all while Lang had been in prison, although Luis still looked on the positive side; at least he gained his parents' van, which Lang complimented was very nice, much to Luis' utter delight while they continued to make their way to the city to restart Lang's life.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang finally returns to \nSan Francisco\n \n \nOn the way to \nThe Milgrom Hotel\n where Lang had been offered a sofa to sleep on for at least his first few weeks of being out of prison and back in the real world, Luis informed Lang of a \nplace\n they could rob, claiming that he had recruited some highly skilled people who could assist them. However, Lang flat out rejected the idea and claimed that he would not be sent back to prison due to having a \ndaughter\n he had vowed to focus his efforts on. As Lang was remaining confident that he would be able to find a job, as he still had a master's degree in electronics, Luis however, warned that ex-convicts usually struggled to get employment, although Lang insisted he would be fine.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang gets a terrible job at \nBaskin-Robbins\n \n \nLang obtained a job at \nBaskin-Robbins\n, going by the name of Jack; despite his degree in electronics, his criminal record would prevent him from getting a job as most potential employers would think he would revert to crime, so going by an alias was the best choice. One day, he got a dimwitted teenager as a customer, who kept asking for things that an ice cream shop did not sell. Despite all Lang's polite encouragement to realize he was in the wrong place for those orders, \nDale\n, his manager, called for him allowing Lang to ask a fellow employee to handle the dimwit while he was gone.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is soon fired from \nBaskin-Robbins\n \n \nInside Dale's office, Lang learned that Baskin-Robbins had found out about his past as the well-known criminal who was responsible for robbing \nGeoff Zorick\n and returning all of their money to his former customers and being sent to \nSan Quentin State Prison\n. Though a fan of his work against the corrupt \nVistaCorp\n, Dale was forced to fire Lang due to him lying on his application. Though as some consolation, Dale allowed Lang to take a free smoothie with him when he left and despite him being mortified by Dale's attitude to the situation, Lang took the free smoothie regardless and made his way back home.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang meets \nDave\n and \nKurt Goreshter\n \n \nArriving at the residence, Lang explained how he had just been fired before being introduced to \nKurt Goreshter\n and \nDave\n, whom Luis had rounded up in hopes of helping in his planned heist if Lang agreed. Luis excitedly explained that Kurt had just gotten out of \nFolsom Prison\n and went into great detail about Lang's criminal career. He quickly realized what was happening and once again insisted that he would not be going back to stealing as he intended to support \nhis daughter\n, despite Luis' insistence that the \nbillionaire\n they would be targeting would be the perfect victim. Lang still refused.\n[\n3\n]\nUnwelcome Family Reunion\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is reunited with his daughter \nCassie\n \n \n\"I'm trying, okay? I've changed, and I'm straight. I had a job, and... I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love \nher\n. So much. I've missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?\"\n\"Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You're her hero, Scott. Just... be the person that she already thinks you are.\"\nScott Lang and \nMaggie Lang\n[src]\nOn the very same day was \nCassie Lang\n's birthday party, which was being held at \nJim Paxton\n's house. Although he was not invited to the party she was having, Lang turned up at \nPaxton's home\n. Cassie was delighted to see him and hugged her father tightly; he managed to give his gift to Cassie despite the cold treatment Paxton gave him. Ignoring Paxton's comments about him not being invited to the party, Lang handed his daughter her birthday present, an ugly rabbit toy which she instantly adored.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang has an argument with his \nex-wife\n \n \nCassie then went to inform her mother of Lang's sudden arrival, much to Lang's dismay at being left with Paxton who berated him for failing to pay child support. When his ex-wife \nMaggie\n appeared, she asked to speak to Lang outside of their house. From there, they discussed a little bit of what Lang must do before he can visit Cassie again, with Lang insisting that he had a \njob\n and was not going back to crime before Maggie demanded that he leave their home and come back once he had gotten himself a job and was able to begin finally paying child support he currently owed to them.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang agrees to take the job with \nLuis\n' crew\n \n \nLang was left depressed by this turn of events, as by the time he had saved enough money to pay child support to his ex-wife, he would have missed another two years of Cassie's life. This forced him to listen to \nLuis\n' proposal about a crime, to make quick cash. It turned out that the target was the safe belonging to a \nretired mogul\n whose money would be protected by insurance so nobody would really be hurt, the kind of target perfect for Lang's morals. With Lang now officially on board, they quickly began planning with \nKurt Goreshter\n and \nDave\n as Lang took charge of the planning of the heist.\n[\n3\n]\nBreaking into Pym's Residence\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang breaks into the \nPym Residence\n \n \n\"There's a fingerprint lock on the door.\"\n\"It's got a what? \nErnesto\n didn't tell me nothin' about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?\"\n\"Not necessarily.\"\nScott Lang and \nLuis\n[src]\nWith the help of his newly found heist team, Lang was able to break into the \nPym Residence\n easily, with \nLuis\n staying nearby and offering support from inside his van. Lang was soon slowed down, however, when he discovered the basement door had a fingerprint scanner he had not planned for. Rather than giving up, Lang recreated a fingerprint using a ring, tape, glue, and some heat from the stove, unlocking the door and making his way downstairs.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang discovers the second vault doorway\n \n \nLang found the vault, which was made of the same 1910s material as the \nRMS Titanic\n and sparked a brief conversation between \nDave\n and \nKurt Goreshter\n about the \n1997 \nTitanic\n movie\n. Thinking on his feet, Lang promptly created a freezing agent and poured it into the door, Lang explained to his confused friends over the radio that \"ice expands, metal doesn't\"; in a few minutes, the ice with burst the door open. He set up a blanket to catch the screws flying out and a mattress to soften the door's fall, and therefore keep any loud noises from alerting the nearby neighbors.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang finds and steals the \nAnt-Man Suit\n \n \nAs soon as the door was blown open, Lang immediately scanned the room for cash and other valuables, only to find nothing but a few hanging blueprints, some \ncolored liquid\n contained in test tubes, and a \nsuit\n with a helmet that seemed to be as a pair of motorcycling attire, informing Luis and the other two of the failure to find anything clearly worth any money. Disappointed that all the security was just for an old outfit, Lang decided to take it anyway for his troubles; he likely planned to sell it at a later point to make a profit off this venture. Unknown to Lang, \nHank Pym\n had been watching everything he did, with a camera mounted on the back of an \nant\n.\n[\n3\n]\nTrials of the Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang carefully examines the \nPym Particles\n \n \n\"The \nworld\n sure seems different from down here, doesn't it, Scott?\"\n\"Who said that?\"\n\"It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.\"\n\nHank Pym\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nThe following day back at \nThe Milgrom Hotel\n, Lang was alone in the apartment and looking himself in the mirror, considering what he should do next. Taking some time to look at what he stole, Lang studied the \nPym Particles\n, unaware of their power before examining the \nAnt-Man Suit\n and there was a helmet, still assuming them to just be motorcycle gear.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tries on the suit for the first time\n \n \nSeeing that the suit was about his size, Lang then checked the suit and tried it on, standing in the bath to get a better look as he began admiring himself in the mirror. Looking over the suit's design, Lang saw buttons on each glove and began experimenting with them, while nothing happened when he pushed the one on the left glove, he pushed the one on the right, suddenly shrinking to a minuscule size, with even the plug hole of the bath appearing much larger than he was. He promptly fell a great distance into the tub, frightened by his new perspective as he tried to figure out what had just happened and how this could be possible.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang runs from the water flow\n \n \nWhile Lang continued to panic, \nHank Pym\n used this chance to get through the suit and communicate with Lang, mocking him for his confusion about what was happening and explaining that this would be a trial by fire. During their conversation, \nLuis\n arrived and stepped into the bathroom for a bath, causing Lang to have to run for his life as Luis turned on the tap, flooding the bath. The water caught up to Lang who was thrown from the bath and soon fell through a gap in the floor to the apartment below where he landed on a record player and held on as he was spun around uncontrollably.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang continues to suffer as the Ant-Man\n \n \nLang continued to be thrown across the room without being noticed due to his small size, suffering from landing inside a vacuum cleaner and being attacked by a rat. As Lang desperately ran away from the rat, he crashed into a mouse trap which launched him high into the air and out of a window, where he fell to the street below and landed on a car roof. While lying on the rooftop, Lang finally figured out how to grow back to normal size and freaked out about what he had just witnessed, wanting nothing more to do with the suit and its power.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is arrested outside the \nPym Residence\n \n \nLang broke back into the \nPym Residence\n again to return the suit to the safe. However, on his way out, he was caught by police officers called by \nHope van Dyne\n who were waiting outside. Without thinking, Lang attempted to defend himself by claiming that he was not stealing anything but was instead returning something that he had stolen. This tactic failed, as he should have left out the part about being the one who had robbed the house in the first place, and Lang was handcuffed and taken straight back to jail.\n[\n3\n]\nPrison Break\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is judged by \nJim Paxton\n in his cell\n \n \n\"You have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.\"\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\"No, I don't expect you to. But you don't have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I.\"\n\nHank Pym\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nJim Paxton\n expressed his disappointment to find Lang back in jail again when they thought he had turned for the good and had believed it ever since he had left \nSan Quentin State Prison\n. Lang was more than annoyed, as Paxton was married to his \nex-wife\n. Paxton's partner \nGale\n came and told him he had a visitor. When Lang asked who it was, the officer simply said that it was his lawyer and then brought him into the visiting room.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is finally introduced to \nHank Pym\n \n \nLang was greeted by \nHank Pym\n, who was keeping his visit secret by using \nAnts\n to block the camera. Pym revealed to Lang that he was behind the heist by getting the information to \nLuis\n in order to pass it to Lang. Pym explained that he did all this to test if he got the right man to succeed as the Ant-Man. Lang then wanted to tell that he'd take no part in it anymore, but Pym persuaded him by helping him with \nCassie\n if he agreed to become the Ant-Man. Pym told Lang he should take this second chance and, having given Lang the option, Pym left using the ants to mask his departure.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang uses the \nAnt-Man Suit\n to escape\n \n \nNot long after Pym departed, a few ants visited Lang's cell with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n, which was promptly re-enlarged with the \nPym Particles\n for him to wear. They formed the number ten and began counting down, which told Lang that he only had a few seconds to don the suit and shrink out of the cell. Lang did so and was congratulated by Pym over the radio for finally listening to what he had told him. Following Pym's instructions, Lang escaped the cell by running below the bars just as \nGale\n arrived and alerted the other police officers of Lang's mysterious disappearance.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang gets a lift from \nHank Pym\n's ant army\n \n \nMaking his way outside, Lang made his escape by running out the door and being greeted by a team of ants, one of whom had a camera which Pym used to watch his movements. Lang jumped on the back of a carpenter \nant\n and flew to safety high over the streets of \nSan Francisco\n while the police department desperately searched for him. As they flew over the city and hitched a ride on the side of a police car, Lang asked Pym questions about the ants until he eventually fell unconscious due to feeling lightheaded from the shock of everything he had been through with this new technology.\n[\n3\n]\nHank Pym's Mission\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is greeted by \nHope van Dyne\n \n \n\"My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are over. What do you want me to do?\"\n\"I want you to break into a \nplace\n and steal some \nshit\n.\"\n\"Makes sense.\"\nScott Lang and \nHank Pym\n[src]\nThe next day, Lang woke up in a bed only to find \nHope van Dyne\n standing at the end of the bed watching him. Van Dyne explained that she had been watching him all night because the last time Lang was at the \nPym Residence\n he had robbed them. Lang was then invited down to breakfast, having to dodge the fire \nAnts\n that littered the floor around him.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang listens to \nHank Pym\n's explanation\n \n \nLang joined Van Dyne and \nHank Pym\n downstairs at their coffee table. Pym then revealed that it was Van Dyne who had Lang arrested for stealing the \nAnt-Man Suit\n and explained that she did not think Lang was needed for their \nupcoming heist\n. Pym explained he had been watching Lang ever since the \nVistaCorp\n \nrobbery\n as he felt his skills would be useful for them, while Lang was distracted by the ants moving across the table and obeying all of Pym's commands. He eventually decided to question everything that was happening and why he was there in the first place.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang and Pym discuss the \nYellowjacket Suit\n \n \nAs they both went downstairs, Pym explained that while he had been working with \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n he had created the \nPym Particles\n, only to decide they were too dangerous and hid them from the world, building \nPym Technologies\n. Pym took on a young protege called \nDarren Cross\n who went on to betray him trying to recreate the Pym Particles. Pym told Lang that Cross had almost completed the \nYellowjacket Suit\n which had the potential to destroy the world. Lang agreed to help, claiming his days of being a thief were over, except Pym explained that he needed Lang to be a thief and steal the Yellowjacket suit before Cross could sell it.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang agrees to assist in \nHank Pym\n's mission\n \n \nAs Pym explained that \nMitchell Carson\n was planning on buying the Yellowjacket, Lang suggested calling the \nAvengers\n but Pym refused; explaining that he had spent years keeping the technology away from \nHoward Stark\n and noting how \nTony Stark\n misused technology to create \nUltron\n. Lang questioned why Pym was not going and he explained that he was unable to use the suit anymore due to a toll it took on his body. Van Dyne also questioned if Lang was right for the job, leading to a brief argument until Lang agreed to steal the suit from Cross. In exchange, Pym would have Lang employed so that Lang could pay child support in order to retain visitation rights for his daughter.\n[\n3\n]\nBecoming Ant-Man\n[\n]\nBeginning Training\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang trains with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n \n \n\"This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your \ndaughter\n's eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It's not about saving our world, it's about saving theirs.\"\n\"Damn, that was a good speech.\"\n\"Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.\"\n\nHank Pym\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nTo begin their training, \nHank Pym\n then gave Lang the task of running towards a closed door and jumping through the keyhole while tiny, then use the \nPym Particles\n to return to normal size; this was the first test of mastering how to alter size with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n at the right time. While Lang remained confident, he failed time after time again, much to the annoyance of both \nHope van Dyne\n and Pym. Hope was secretly amused by Lang's failings, as she believed that she would have done better than all of his failed attempts.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang carefully studies the \nAnt-Man Suit\n \n \nHaving struggled with the tests he was given by both Pym and Van Dyne as he was still unable to leap through the keyhole correctly without crashing into the door and injuring himself, Lang decided to take it upon himself to try and use his own engineering skills to improve the design of the Ant-Man Suit, seeking a way to redesign the Ant-Man Suit in order to get the advantage over \nDarren Cross\n before they would steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n from him. With this in his mind, Lang took the suit into the \nPym Residence\n basement and began taking it apart to understand exactly how it worked.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is warned about the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \nWhile Lang was pulling the suit apart and studying the different pieces of technology, he was found and confronted by Pym. Lang explained that he intended to rework the regulator on the suit, but was told that if he did, then he would risk going subatomic. Lang questioned what Pym meant by this and was told he would enter the \nQuantum Realm\n where he would then become trapped for all time in the dark section of the \nMultiverse\n, with Pym hinting that he knew \nsomeone\n this had happened to. Now aware of the dangers, Lang agreed not to mess with the regulator.\n[\n3\n]\nCombat Training\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is combat trained by \nHope van Dyne\n \n \n\"You're going to have to learn how to punch.\"\n\"You're going to show me how to punch? Show me how to punch.\"\n\"That's how you punch.\"\n\nHope van Dyne\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nFor all the physical parts of \nstealing\n the \nYellowjacket Suit\n, Lang had to prepare himself for knocking out the guards as he made his way to the suit. He was then trained by \nHope van Dyne\n. She explained to Lang that the wearer of the \nAnt-Man Suit\n must control their strength or they could kill. Hope said she would teach him how to punch but Lang scoffed at this, noting he was in \nSan Quentin State Prison\n for three years for robbing \nVistaCorp\n so he knew how to punch, having hit \nPeachy\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is soon subdued by \nHope van Dyne\n \n \nLang invited van Dyne to show him how to punch, lifting up his hand for her, but she responded by punching him in the face and knocking him to the ground. They were joined by \nHank Pym\n who noted with great amusement that van Dyne had been looking forward to fighting Lang, explaining she had been trained in \nMuay Thai\n since a young age. It was noted by van Dyne that she had begun training when her own \nmother\n had died, saying that Pym had never told her the truth about her mother's death. As Pym left, Lang got up and questioned if van Dyne had aimed her punch for his hand or his face.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tends to all of his many new injuries\n \n \nThey trained together and neither one held back with their fighting styles, with Lang quickly learning that van Dyne was not a woman to be underestimated as she was a superior fighter compared to him. As Lang's fighting skills improved under van Dyne's training, he became cocky, mocking van Dyne when he landed a strike on her, only to be quickly silenced when van Dyne would pin him to the ground and twist his arm back, forcing him to yield. Lang soon found himself covered with bruises and cuts, which he patched up, being watched by van Dyne as he tended to all of his injuries.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang trains to use the \nPym Particle Discs\n \n \nLang was informed by van Dyne that Pym wanted to see him outside of the \nPym Residence\n in order to train with target practice. Pym then showed Lang his new \nPym Particle Discs\n, noting that because the Ant-Man Suit did not have any actual weapons, he had decided to design and make these, which would use the \nPym Particles\n to either strike or enlarge items without killing. Pym demonstrated this to Lang by throwing the discs at his garden gnomes which tripled in size upon contact with the disks before Lang and Pym practiced throwing the disks at their targets to master the skill for the mission.\n[\n3\n]\nMeeting the Ants\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is sent to meet his new ant allies\n \n \n\"I know this guy. I'm going to call him \nAnt-thony\n.\"\n\"That's good. That's very good, because this time, you're really going to have to learn how to control him.\"\nScott Lang and \nHank Pym\n[src]\nBeing taken into the basement, \nHank Pym\n told Lang that while he was still learning how to control the \nAnt-Man Suit\n, it was also time that he met and mastered controlling his most important allies for their mission, the \nAnts\n themselves. Donning the Ant-Man suit, Lang was sent into the \nPym Residence\n garden to explore the tunnels created by the ants while \nHope van Dyne\n and Pym watched him from the sidelines.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man first encounters the crazy ants\n \n \nWhile inside the tunnels, Lang first encountered the small crazy ant, which could be used to conduct electricity and also carry cameras and other devices into \nPym Technologies Headquarters\n to help him fry the security systems before Lang would be able to attempt to then steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. Lang at first viewed it as cute and allowed it to climb on top of him. However, when the rest of the small army of ants charged in and surrounded Lang, he freaked out and returned to normal size, slightly embarrassed as Lang burst through the ground while Pym and van Dyne were still watching all his actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man befriends and feeds \nAnt-thony\n \n \nThe next stage of Lang's training involved meeting the army of flying carpenter ants which would assist Lang to his missions by flying him inside. There, he was reintroduced to the ant that flew him out of \nSan Quentin State Prison\n. Lang almost immediately developed a strong connection to the ant, feeding him some water and even renaming him \nAnt-thony\n, which Pym approved of as he told Lang that he would soon need to master communicating with all of the ants ready for the mission by using the \nEMP Communication Device\n, tasking him with telling some of the ants to put some sugar in a mug of tea.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man runs alongside his teams of ants\n \n \nLang was introduced to a group of bullet ants, which he remembered as the kind that had covered the bedroom floor when he had awoken in the \nPym Residence\n. When the ants charged at Lang, he yet again freaked out and used the \nPym Particles\n to regrow to normal size. Finally, Pym showed Lang all of the fire ants which could be used as natural architects and transport Lang throughout tight corners and difficult to move locations by creating long structures, like rafts and bridges. Lang tested out his skills of communication with the Ants as he ran down the tunnels with them all as his tiny army.\n[\n3\n]\nWhile Lang initially had trouble communicating with the ants due to him constantly worrying about \nCassie\n, after some counseling from van Dyne, he concentrated his constant concern into forming a strong connection with the ants at his disposal.\n[\n7\n]\nBecoming One with the Ants\n[\n]\n\"To carry off the \nBig Job\n, I'd have to learn how to lead a variety of \nAnts\n as a team. That is what \nHank\n and \nHope\n had in mind when they brought me to the \nHill\n.\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nIn order to become more acquainted with the \nAnts\n, \nHope van Dyne\n and \nHank Pym\n requested that Lang take a journey into the \nHill\n, a massive anthill in the backyard of the \nPym Residence\n which served as a central hub for all of the ants in the area. After shrinking his way inside, Lang noticed that the colony was moving their eggs and larvae to a warmer part of the mound. Thinking that, if he assisted the ants in their task, they would become more friendly towards him, Lang grabbed one of the eggs, only for the ants to begin to swarm him response. Luckily, Lang kept his cool and successfully ordered the ants off of him and, with the help of a little bit of sugar to distract the ants, he was able to escape from the Hill.\nReturning to van Dyne and Pym in Pym's lab, Pym scolded Lang for returning so soon, but van Dyne was more reassuring. She told Lang that he needed to rally the ants behind a common cause, giving Pym's early EMP tests with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n as an example. With van Dyne's advice in tow, Lang journeyed back into the Hill.\nOnce in the Hill, Lang noticed a rotting lemon that was dripping its acidic juice down into the Hill. Realizing that this was a big problem for the ants, Lang called upon them to lift him up so he could move the lemon. Knowing that they had a common enemy, the ants happily accepted Lang's call to action, forming a tower that lifted Lang high enough for him to reach the lemon. Much to Lang's dismay, he saw Pym walking away from the scene, implying that he placed the lemon there. Lang didn't care that much, however, as he and the ants had finally become a team.\n[\n7\n]\nMission Planning\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is briefed on their new mission plans\n \n \n\"The \nYellowjacket\n pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.\"\n\"Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?\"\n\"The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.\"\n\nHope van Dyne\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nWhile still attempting to master all of the skills he would need for the mission, Lang was also briefed by \nHank Pym\n on exactly how they planned to \ninfiltrate\n the \nPym Technologies Headquarters\n in order to finally steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. Lang was informed that the headquarters had guards by the security systems, explaining that they would need to take out the guard in order to turn off the security and then retrieve the Yellowjacket Suit without being caught.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang concerns about the mission\n \n \nLang listened closely as \nHope van Dyne\n explained to him how the Yellowjacket Suit was currently secured within a pod which was hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube that they had estimated to be about five millimeters in diameter. Lang noted he was getting sick to his stomach as van Dyne explained he would have to get the \nAnts\n to shut off the power to the laser grid so he could collect the suit and get out within fifteen seconds when the backup power would come on, all before \nDarren Cross\n could even discover their deception, a plan which worried Lang.\n[\n3\n]\nHank Pym's Confession\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tries to communicate with the \nAnts\n \n \n\"\nHe\n doesn't want to shut you out. He trusts you.\"\n\"Then why are you here?\"\n\"It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I'm expendable, that's why I'm here. You must've realized that by now.\"\nScott Lang and \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nDespite all of his work in trying to master his new abilities, Lang still found it almost impossible to successfully communicate with all of the \nAnts\n, much to the continued frustration of \nHank Pym\n. Believing that their chances of successfully completing their mission with Lang as the Ant-Man were now nearly impossible, \nHope van Dyne\n once again proved that she was the better choice for the \nmission\n by demonstrating how she could easily communicate with the ants.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang connects with \nHope van Dyne\n \n \nEventually, Pym ordered van Dyne to stop, causing her to get in her father's face and tell him that she did not understand why she ever thought he could help stop \nDarren Cross\n in the first place before storming out of the \nPym Residence\n in frustration. Pym then told Lang that they could complete the plan without van Dyne's assistance, so Lang followed van Dyne out and listened as van Dyne explained how her relationship with Pym had fallen apart ever since her mother, \nJanet van Dyne\n had died, noting that Pym had never explained how she had died and sent her to boarding school as a result.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang finally communicates with the Ants\n \n \nWhen van Dyne claimed Pym chose Lang to be the Ant-Man as he did not trust her, Lang corrected her by noting that it was because he did not want to lose her like he had lost his wife, noting that Pym had clearly viewed him as expendable. Van Dyne then apologized for having Lang arrested by \nJim Paxton\n, noting that she did not know he had a \ndaughter\n at the time. Feeling a closer connection to Lang now, van Dyne gave him back the \nEMP Communication Device\n before she then assisted him in mastering communication with the ants, as Lang successfully made the ants spin a coin with his mind.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang ruins \nPym\n and \nvan Dyne\n's moment\n \n \nAs Lang and van Dyne returned to the \nPym Residence\n, they were greeted by \nHank Pym\n, who told van Dyne that her mother worked with him at \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n under the codename of the \nWasp\n and had been become trapped within the \nQuantum Realm\n when she saved the \nUnited States of America\n from a Soviet missile attack. Having learned the truth, van Dyne finally forgave her father and the two embraced. The emotional and intimate moment between Pym and his daughter ended when Lang commented on the beauty of the moment, unintentionally ruining it before quickly leaving.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man rides on the back of \nAnt-thony\n \n \nWith new confidence in his team, Lang excelled at the other forms of his training to prepare to break into \nPym Technologies\n and soon steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. Much to his delight, Lang perfected leaping through a keyhole in the \nAnt-Man Suit\n and communicating with the ants to form a tiny army ready to be used for infiltration. Lang even bonded with one ant which he named \nAnt-thony\n. Meanwhile, Pym continued to work with the \nPym Particles\n while Lang helped load tiny cameras onto the backs on the ants to allow Pym and van Dyne a way to watch the mission unfold in real time.\n[\n3\n]\nDuel at the Avengers Compound\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man rides \nAnt-thony\n to his mission\n \n \n\"You want to tell me what you want?\"\n\"I was hoping I could grab a \npiece of technology\n, just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.\"\n\nFalcon\n and Ant-Man\n[src]\nConfident that his training was going well, \nHank Pym\n sent Lang on a mission retrieve a \nSignal Decoy\n which was being held inside of an old building that was used by \nHoward Stark\n, citing that this device would later assist Lang when it came time to steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n from \nDarren Cross\n. However, it had turned out Pym's intel was long-outdated, as this \"storage facility\" had since been converted into the \nAvengers Compound\n, much to Lang's utter horror.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man attempts to reason with \nFalcon\n \n \nPym told Lang to return to \nSan Francisco\n. Instead, Lang still decided to go to the facility and landed on the roof leading to an encounter with \nFalcon\n, who was guarding the facility. Despite believing his small size would keep him undetected, Lang found that Falcon's goggles were able to zoom in on him. Lang attempted to explain his situation to Falcon, being polite and introducing himself while also noting that he was a big fan of the \nAvengers\n. Falcon did not believe his claims and attempted to arrest Lang, forcing Lang to shrink in size.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man attempts to avoid \nFalcon\n's attacks\n \n \nWhile the confused Falcon attempted to figure out where the now tiny Lang had disappeared to, Ant-Man then launched up and hit him in the face, resulting in Falcon activating his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n which had knocked Ant-Man off the roof with a gust of wind. Although he tried to escape, Ant-Man was quickly spotted by Falcon who then tried to shoot at him, with Ant-Man hiding beside the gun barrel and then defending himself. During the fight, Lang used the \nAnt-Man Suit\n and his new fighting skills to keep up with Falcon, although he continually apologized for being forced to hit him during their skirmish.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is forced to battle against \nFalcon\n \n \nDespite Lang using his size to his advantage, Falcon was eventually able to land a hard punch on his, causing the \nPym Particles\n to revert Lang to his normal size. While \nHank Pym\n furiously ordered Lang to stop what he was doing, Lang continued fighting as the Falcon hit him repeatedly and flew him high up into the air. However, Lang still remained determined to complete his current mission as he had been instructed to do and managed to use his suit's shrinking abilities and the Falcon's own technology to his advantage, dragging the Falcon across the ground before launching him through the air.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man tries to disable the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n \n \nEventually, seeing that Falcon would still be able to spot him in the grass, Lang called \nAnt-thony\n to assist him by quickly flying him inside the facility where he soon stole the device. Having taken the device as Pym and \nHope van Dyne\n had ordered him to do, Ant-Man managed to hide from the Falcon as Lang prepared to try and new tactic to defeat him and then make his escape. As the Falcon again attempted to stop him from getting away, Ant-Man shrunk down and entered inside of the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n Suit and attempted to disable it by ripped out all of the wires from within the suit itself.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man manages to escape from \nFalcon\n \n \nAs a result, the Falcon's wings began to malfunction, causing him to crash through the doors and back outside as Lang still continued to apologize for doing any harm to a member of the \nAvengers\n. Despite Falcon spinning around to attempt and throw Ant-Man out of his suit, Falcon eventually crash landed and was unable to find Ant-Man, with Lang escaping the facility with the help of Ant-thony, while the Falcon insisted that \nCaptain America\n never learn of the incident. This brief skirmish between them greatly impressed Falcon, who was on a lookout for some new and talented people to join the Avengers.\n[\n3\n]\nComplicating the Plan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang learns \nDarren Cross\n is in the \nhouse\n \n \n\"So we expand our team. What do we need? A \nfake security guard\n on the inside to depressurize the water system, \nsomebody else\n to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a \ngetaway guy\n.\"\n\"No, no, no, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.\"\nScott Lang and \nHank Pym\n[src]\nAs the group discussed the heist, \nDarren Cross\n arrived at the \nPym Residence\n, planning to kill \nHank Pym\n, but he chose against it. Not wanting Cross to see the plans, Lang had \nants\n roll them up. Cross eventually left but he called \nHope van Dyne\n to tell her that he was beefing up security. At this point, Cross knew Hank was the previous Ant-Man and worried that he might try to steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n, so he ensured that security measures were taken that could detect even the tiniest living beings, including a person the size of an ant.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang shows off the \nAnt-Man Suit\n \n \nKnowing that they would need help with getting past the extra security, Lang, despite Pym's misgivings, sought the aid of \nLuis\n, \nKurt Goreshter\n, and \nDave\n. He showed them how the suit worked managing to scare them into thinking it was magic briefly. After being briefed on the plan, Scott let Hope drug them with Xanax while Hank bored them by explaining the suit's science; as a result, the three got to spend some quiet time on the rest of the plan.\n[\n3\n]\nStealing the Yellowjacket\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang commands \nAnt-thony\n during the heist\n \n \n\"I'm employing the bullet \nAnts\n. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.\"\nAnt-Man\n[src]\nDespite the logistical setbacks imposed by Cross, the team still managed to \ninfiltrate the facility\n while Cross was holding an important event. Luis, posing as a security guard, gained access to the building's water main and shut it off long enough for Lang and his army of \nants\n to gain access. Lang managed to make it into the hermetically sealed chamber that contained the \nYellowjacket Suit\n, but at the last moment, Cross revealed his awareness of their plan and trapped Lang inside the chamber after removing the Yellowjacket suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man facing off against \nDarren Cross\n \n \nMomentarily having the upper hand, \nDarren Cross\n' security held \nHank Pym\n and \nHope van Dyne\n at gunpoint while he chastised Pym for his failures as a mentor and a scientist. Cross introduced \nMitchell Carson\n from \nHYDRA\n who intended to purchase the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. Cross then took a gun and aimed it at Pym, intending to execute his former mentor. A scuffle broke out in which Lang was able to escape the chamber by smashing through the glass and assisted Pym and van Dyne fighting Cross' guards. Pym fought Cross but was shot in the shoulder; Lang and van Dyne ran to Pym's aid, but he insisted that Lang go after Cross before he escaped.\n[\n3\n]\nStopping Darren Cross\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man holding on \nCross\n' helicopter\n \n \n\"Did you think you could stop the future with a \nheist\n?!\"\n\"It was never just a heist!\"\n\nYellowjacket\n and Ant-Man\n[src]\nDarren Cross\n attempted to evacuate the \nPym Technologies Headquarters\n via private helicopter, taking hostages with him. Ant-Man pursued him and while distracted, Cross donned the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. The two fought at both normal and shrunken sizes, with Yellowjacket's energy weapons disabling the pilots of the helicopter and sending it crashing to the ground. Lang and Cross fell from the helicopter as it was crashing, landing in an unsuspecting family's backyard pool while shrunk, only for the two of them to return to normal size and continue fighting, terrifying the family. Lang momentarily won the battle when he used a ping-pong paddle to swat Cross into a bug zapper, electrocuting him and rendering him unconscious.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is escorted by \nJim Paxton\n \n \nJim Paxton\n arrived due to the disturbance and despite Lang's attempts to explain, he was tasered by Paxton to shut him up and arrest him. Waking up in the back of the squad car, Lang attempted to explain again, but Paxton believed that Lang was simply delusional (given the Ant-Man suit made Scott look like he lost his mind and was playing dress up). At that moment, a dispatch call announced that there was a hostage situation at the address of \nJim Paxton's House\n. Lang knew that \nDarren Cross\n had woken up and was using his daughter to get to him.\n[\n3\n]\nDuel at Jim Paxton's House\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man fights \nYellowjacket\n \n \n\"You insult me, Scott.

You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!\"\n\"Yeah, I agree.\"\n\nYellowjacket\n and Ant-Man\n[src]\nDespite \nJim Paxton\n's refusal to listen to him, Lang managed to get his helmet back on and shrink out of his handcuffs. Lang arrived and the \nbattle between Scott and Cross\n continued, proving at this point to the rival father figure that he was morally sound. Lang used some of the devices that Pym gave him, often missing Cross and either shrinking or enlarging random items, such as \nenlarging an ant\n to the size of a \ndog\n, or a \nThomas the Tank Engine\n toy to the size of a real locomotive.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man kills \nYellowjacket\n \n \nEventually, Lang had the same revelation that \nHank Pym\n and \nJanet van Dyne\n had decades earlier when he failed to access the internals of \nCross' suit\n, which Cross defiantly gloats is due to its titanium construction. Lang accepted that his fate would be like Janet's and disabled the regulator on his suit, shrinking small enough to pass through the atomic structure of the titanium and into Cross' suit. Lang then permanently disabled the Yellowjacket and caused Cross to vanish into thin air.\n[\n3\n]\nQuantum Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is trapped in the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \n\"Scott, please. You don't remember anything?\"\n\"Hank, I... I don't.\"\n\nHank Pym\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nWhile he had succeeded in disabling the \nYellowjacket Suit\n and also stopping \nDarren Cross\n' plans, Ant-Man discovered that he continued to shrink at various intervals, just as \nHank Pym\n had hypothesized. Shrinking well into the subatomic world, witnessing an existence that was perceptually very strange from our own. As he traveled deeper and deeper inside the \nQuantum Realm\n where all time and space was eternal seemingly inescapable, Ant-Man began desperately searching for a way to return home rather than be trapped within there forever.\n[\n3\n]\n He was then met by \nJanet van Dyne\n who implanted something in his brain in hopes that Pym and \nHope van Dyne\n could find her.\n[\n4\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is reunited with \nCassie Lang\n \n \nA terrified Cassie cried out for him, with her voicing booming in the Quantum Realm. Being shaken back to his senses by this, Lang quickly thought of a way to return; he placed one of the \nPym Particle Discs\n into the regulator of his \nAnt-Man Suit\n. Activating the growth function, Lang instantly returned to the normal world and reunited with his Cassie, with \nJim Paxton\n expressing his own gratitude for saving them both. Knowing that he would be arrested if discovered, Lang promptly shrunk out of sight when the police then showed up, using a lamp to enlarge his shadow, Lang saluted goodbye to her and headed off to return to Hank Pym.\n[\n3\n]\nHeist Aftermath\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang and Pym discuss the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \n\"Whoa, hold on. Something's kind of happening.\"\n\"Well, if that's the case, shoot me again.\"\n\"Yeah, I don't know what \nyou\n're doing. grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope.\"\nScott Lang and \nHank Pym\n[src]\nFollowing the events, \nJim Paxton\n dropped the case against Lang. When questioned by \nHank Pym\n about his experience in the \nQuantum Realm\n, Lang could not recall anything, including Janet's presence. Pym guessed that the human mind can only handle so much out of the normal. \nHope van Dyne\n escorted him outside Pym's sitting room, leaving him to briefly contemplate that \nJanet van Dyne\n may still be alive.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is caught kissing \nHope van Dyne\n \n \nOnce they were alone in the \nPym Residence\n hallway, Lang and van Dyne shared a kiss: However, they were quickly discovered when Pym then opened the door to find Lang kissing his daughter. Lang feigned innocence, claiming that van Dyne had kissed him; she didn't deny it, though it looked like he had kissed her. He quickly walked off to go have dinner at \nJim Paxton's House\n with his family, as Pym called after him, calling him out for being a poor liar, something Lang did not even bother denying as he made his hasty departure.\n[\n3\n]\nSought by the Avengers\n[\n]\nUpdated by Luis\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang has dinner with \nJim Paxton\n \n \n\"So I asked \nIgnacio\n: \"Did \nbad-ass\n tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I'm tight with that man, that he's looking for him?\"\"\n\"And? What'd he say?\"\n\"He said yes!\"\n\nLuis\n and Scott Lang\n[src]\nMonths later,\n[\n5\n]\n \nJim Paxton\n invited Lang to have dinner with the family so he could spend time with \nCassie Lang\n, who had adopted the \ndog-sized ant\n as a pet, as payment for saving his daughter's life. During the meal, Paxton told Lang that he would not be arrested as it had been decided that a glitch in the system had caused his earlier release. Lang thanked Paxton personally for this action, knowing that it put his own career on the line, but Paxton insisted he was happy to do it to help out Cassie's father.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang learns that \nFalcon\n is searching for him\n \n \nDuring the dinner, Lang received a call from \nLuis\n who wanted to meet with him. When Lang met with Luis, who was also there with \nDave\n and \nKurt Goreshter\n, he recalled that in his chain of contacts, someone informed him that \nFalcon\n was looking for Lang, due to being impressed with his skills in their \nbrief fight\n and was now interested in recruiting him into the \nAvengers\n. Lang questioned what Luis had told his contacts and he explained that he had told them that he did indeed know the Ant-Man, much to Lang's great dismay at the news.\n[\n3\n]\nRecruited by Captain America\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang wakes up in \nBerlin\n \n \n\"Look, I wanna say: I know you know a lot of super-people, so, thinks for thanking of me.\"\nScott Lang to \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nLang was recruited by \nClint Barton\n during the resulting fallout caused by the Sokovia Accords to support \nSteve Rogers\n and his team. Lang arrived in \nBerlin\n by van and was introduced to Captain America and the rest of the team, showing a great deal of excitement at meeting Rogers and \nWanda Maximoff\n among others. He thanked Rogers for choosing him to assist during this skirmish, noting Rogers likely had other choices.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is introduced to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nLang apologized to \nSam Wilson\n for the \nfight\n they had; Wilson was not angry, calling the fight a great audition and claimed that it would never happen again. Rogers told Lang that they were acting outside the law, but Lang did not refuse to assist him. Rogers then explained that they were going up against the \nWinter Soldiers\n who were going to be freed by \nHelmut Zemo\n and must be stopped before they could cause chaos across the whole world.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man steals the \nshield\n from \nSpider-Man\n \n \n\"Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.\"\n\"Who's speaking?\"\n\"It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.\"\nAnt-Man and \nIron Man\n[src]\nWhen \nIron Man\n and his team approached \nCaptain America\n in the \nLeipzig-Halle Airport\n and the situation escalated with \nSpider-Man\n taking Captain America's \nshield\n, Ant-Man used the distraction of the ensuing argument to sneak forward and stole the shield, kicking Spider-Man in the face before proudly handing the shield back to Captain America.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man fighting against the \nBlack Widow\n \n \nWhile Iron Man and other members of the team charged after Rogers and other members of their team, including \nHawkeye\n and \nBucky Barnes\n, Lang was left face to face with \nBlack Widow\n, noting that he really did not want to hurt her. The two began fighting regardless and Ant-Man shrunk down and attempted to twist Black Widow's arm around her back; however, she activated her \nbite\n which sent Ant-Man flying backward while she moved onwards.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man assists \nCaptain America\n \n \nCatching up with Captain America, Ant-Man found what he thought was a water truck and shrunk it down, handing it to Captain America and telling him to throw it at one of his \nPym Particle Discs\n. Captain America did just that and the truck returned to its original size, falling towards \nWar Machine\n and \nBlack Panther\n. However, it exploded upon impact, much to Ant-Man's surprise as he apologized to Captain America for his mistake before they made a hasty retreat.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man runs with \nCaptain America\n's team\n \n \nRejoining \nFalcon\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n among the other members of Captain America's team, Ant-Man attempted to run to the \nQuinjet\n to escape, but their path was then blocked by the \nVision\n, forcing the two opposing teams to face off against each other. Following their leader's direction, Ant-Man followed his teammates as they charged forward and engaged in a \nfierce clash\n against the various heroes who had joined \nIron Man\n's team supporting the Sokovia Accords, with Ant-Man once again fighting against Black Widow.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man riding on one of \nHawkeye\n's arrow\n \n \nHaving gotten away from Black Widow, Ant-Man teamed up with \nHawkeye\n and they decided to take care of their opponent's leader in order to gain a much-needed advantage in this fight. Ant-Man took position on \nHawkeye's Scatter Arrow\n, giving his approval and was propelled through the air to hijack \nIron Man's suit\n, dodging shots fired from Iron Man's gauntlets and diving through Iron Man's fingers and get within the suit itself and cause some mayhem.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man damages \nIron Man\n's systems\n \n \nOnce inside the suit, Ant-Man used his mechanical knowledge to greatly damage the suit's many weapons systems, mocking \nTony Stark\n as he panicked and tried to understand what was happening, with Ant-Man claiming to be the voice of Iron Man's own conscience. Ant-Man continued the mission to damage the suit as much as possible, which he managed to do before Iron Man finally ordered \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to use the suit's own extinguishing foam to force Ant-Man out.\n[\n5\n]\nGiant-Man Attacks\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man prepares to unleash Giant-Man\n \n \n\"I got something kinda big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell, and if I tear myself in half, don't come back for me. I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss!\"\nAnt-Man to \nCaptain America\n[src]\nAs the fight progressed, \nHawkeye\n then noted that unless something drastic happened, this showdown was looking like an impending stalemate. \nCaptain America\n agreed, and \nFalcon\n asked the team for a distraction. Ant-Man chimed in that he had a possible idea, but had tested it only once in a laboratory, and the test had left him in rough shape.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man transforms into the Giant-Man\n \n \nRunning out of options, Captain America did not object and Ant-Man let loose his distraction. Ant-Man got his adrenaline pumping as he jumped onto the back of \nWar Machine\n and used the suit to grow into a monstrous size as he towered over the entire airport and grabbed War Machine by his leg, laughing maniacally at his success. Giant-Man reigned shock and mayhem on \nIron Man\n's forces, all of whom were too distracted by him to notice Rogers was escaping.\n \n \n \n \n \nGiant-Man rips apart an entire airplane\n \n \nWreaking havoc across the airport to keep the enemies distracted, Giant-Man threw War Machine across the airport before he ripped the wing of a nearby airplane. He then attempted to attack \nBlack Panther\n; however, he was knocked back by War Machine firing explosives near his face. Meanwhile, \nVision\n reappeared on the battlefield and knocked Giant-Man back before flying through him to try and stop Captain America's escape by blocking his path.\n \n \n \n \n \nGiant-Man tries to fight against \nSpider-Man\n \n \nWhile \nWanda Maximoff\n helped Captain America get past Vision, Giant-Man found himself surrounded by \nIron Man\n, War Machine and \nSpider-Man\n, all of whom worked together to try and defeat Giant-Man however they could. Taking inspiration from \nThe Empire Strikes Back\n, Spider-Man used his own \nWeb-Shooters\n to tie up Giant-Man's legs and force him to become unbalanced before Iron Man and War Machine both flew upwards and knocked him to the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is defeated in the battlefield\n \n \nAlthough Giant-Man was taken out of the fight, this stunt provided exactly the distraction Captain America and \nBucky Barnes\n needed to escape, taking control of the \nQuinjet\n and using it to get away from the battlefield. With his weight having been used against him, Giant-Man accepted his defeat. Exhausted at this point in the battle, Giant-Man engaged the suit and returned to his regular size, requested orange slices to help him recover from the painful experience.\n[\n5\n]\nPrisoner of the Raft\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tries and fails to insult \nTony Stark\n \n \n\"\nHank Pym\n always said, you never can trust a Stark.\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"...Come on, man.\"\nScott Lang and \nTony Stark\n[src]\nAfter the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, Lang, \nClint Barton\n, \nWanda Maximoff\n, and \nSam Wilson\n were all captured, along with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n, and taken to the \nRaft\n where they were imprisoned under the orders of \nThaddeus Ross\n for destroying the airport and aiding \nCaptain America\n, the \nWinter Soldier\n and \nFalcon\n. When \nTony Stark\n visited, Lang said \nHank Pym\n was right not to trust the Starks. Much to Lang's frustration, the Avenger leader asked him who he is sparing only a confused and dismissive glance at Lang before he moved on to speak with Wilson.\n[\n5\n]\nEscape from the Raft\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is freed by Captain America\n \n \n\"After the whole Accords \nsituation\n, \nhe\n and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families; they're on house arrest.\"\n\nNatasha Romanoff\n[src]\nLang was then forced to continue his sentence within the \nRaft\n, playing a beat by tapping his hands on a chair; however, Rogers infiltrated the Raft and freed him, \nClint Barton\n, \nSam Wilson\n, and \nWanda Maximoff\n from their imprisonment, with Lang recovering the suit.\nLang soon returned to his \ndaughter\n in \nSan Francisco\n, knowing he was still a wanted man for allying himself with Steve Rogers,\n[\n10\n]\n and alongside Barton ended up making a deal with the government to be placed under two years of house arrest instead of being returned to the Raft.\n[\n11\n]\n In order to prevent the suit from being taken, Lang informed the authorities, and later Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne that he had destroyed the suit, although in reality he had shrunk the suit down and mailed it to Luis for safekeeping. Van Dyne then broke up with Lang for his stint in \nGermany\n.\n[\n4\n]\nUnder House Arrest\n[\n]\nOccupying Himself\n[\n]\n\"This is going to sound beyond ironic, but those two years sequestered under house arrest (my sentence for joining some \nAvengers\n who were on the wrong side of the \nlaw\n) were some of the freest of my life.\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nAs per his deal, Lang was sentenced to two years of house arrest, followed by three years of probation, along with no contact with \nHank Pym\n or \nHope van Dyne\n. Should he disobey any of these conditions, he would face twenty years in federal prison.\n[\n4\n]\n One of the ways Lang kept himself occupied was arbitrarily change his daily routine in odd ways, such as sleeping standing up or having breakfast for dinner. This was something Lang had previously done during his time in \nSan Quentin\n. Lang did many other activities during this time including playing video games, learning \nClose-up magic\n, reading books he'd always meant to, cooking, and drumming, although his talents with the drums weren't appreciated neighbors.\n[\n7\n]\nReconnecting with Loved Ones\n[\n]\n\"House arrest literally gave me the opportunity of a lifetime: finally getting to hang with my precious \nCassie\n!\"\nScott Lang\n[src]\nStarting to feel the loneliness of house arrest creep up on him, Lang decided to use this time to reconnect with his family. One of the upsides of Lang's house arrest is it gave all the time in the world to be with especially \nCassie\n, with Lang turning the plethora of delivery boxes he had lying around his \nhome\n into various cardboard creations for him and Cassie to play with. These included the Cardboard Roller Coaster, the Cardboard Robot War, the Cardboard Pony Ride, and the Cardboard Water Park, which Lang would later call ill-advised. Lang also found other ways to keep Cassie entertained, such as using \nPym Particles\n to create a giant jelly donut. Lang also spent this time speaking with friends constantly,\n[\n7\n]\n going on to form the security consultation business \nX-Con Security Consultants\n with \nLuis\n, \nKurt Goreshter\n, and \nDave\n.\n[\n4\n]\nAlmost Free\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang playing a treasure game with \nCassie\n \n \n\"Your daddy went to \nGermany\n and \ndrew on the walls\n with \nCaptain America\n. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph Three of the \nSokovia Accords\n.\"\n\nJimmy Woo\n to \nCassie Lang\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang talks to \nLuis\n about the house pitch\n \n \nAfter nearly finishing his two years under house arrest, Lang was at his \nhouse\n with \nCassie\n, where they were playing a treasure game, trying to find a micro treasure. Using a pretend map, Lang went through trials to find it such as Ant-on for directions using Luis' help and going through fake lasers. Once they reached their destination, Lang was surprised to see his \"Greatest Grandma\" trophy, questioning why it was picked as the treasure. Cassie responded that it was a treasure to her and wanted to take to show-and-tell, but Lang rejected that idea.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang talks to \nCassie\n about shrinking down\n \n \nStating that the trophy was very important, Lang made the decision to keep it, leading Cassie to agree. Interrupted, Luis told Lang about the abundance of security cameras inside a house they are selling but told Lang told him not to worry about the amount as long as they are approved. Once they were done talking, Lang and Cassie went on over to the stairs filled with cardboard and slide onto Ant-oinette across the room and outside of the backyard, crash landing a fence.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tells \nLuis\n not to worry\n \n \nOnce they crash-landed, Lang was told by Cassie that she wished she shrank down to small size to which Lang agreed that it was cool to become minuscule. Luis came back to check up on Lang and told that he'll leave for work despite his nerves being unadjusted. Telling Luis to not worry, Lang discovered his leg with an \nAnkle Monitor\n was away from his house and broke the fence, resulting in the \nFBI\n coming to check on him.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is confronted by \nJimmy Woo\n \n \nOnce the FBI noticed the signal, Lang's home was checked upon his accident. Lang told \nJimmy Woo\n not to worry about the incident as he didn't mean to trigger the signal. Once Cassie questioned Woo of his actions, Lang noticed his explanation of the \nSokovia Accords\n and that he was in trouble for his visit with \nCaptain America\n. Lang sarcastically insulted Woo's explanation, but took it as a compliment. Woo then questioned Lang about any contact with \nHank Pym\n and \nHope van Dyne\n, but Lang told him that never tried to contact them.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang bids farewell to \nCassie\n as she leaves\n \n \nAfter suffering another checkup with the FBI, Lang witnessed \nMaggie Lang\n and \nJim Paxton\n picking up Cassie and promised her that once his three-day arrest is over, he will spend time with her by eating ice cream, simulating another card trick before her farewell. As he had the home all to himself, Lang spent the day on playing the drums, bowling, learning more \nClose-up magic\n, doing \nkaraoke\n, reading \nThe Fault in Our Stars\n, and making paper birds in his room.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang has a dream about \nJanet van Dyne\n \n \nDuring his regular bath routine, Lang had a dream where he saw himself in the \nQuantum Realm\n once again before taking on the body of \nJanet van Dyne\n in memory of hers in which he found a little girl hiding in a red dresser. Startled by the vision, Lang woke from his sleep and went to the room and inexplicably called Pym about it, using a secret phone to contact him, but no one answered and instead left a message.\n[\n4\n]\nKidnapped by Hope\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is stung by an artificial insect\n \n \n\"I'm sorry about \nGermany\n. \nThey\n just showed up.

It's what we call him.\"\nScott Lang and \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nOn the night after his rest, Lang was watching \nAnimal House\n on the TV while eating cereal only for a tiny insect to sting him on the neck. Not thinking anything of it, he continued eating cereal until he suddenly fell unconscious. After a brief sleep, Lang woke up in the passenger seat of a van and saw van Dyne sitting beside him, driving ahead. Lang then told van Dyne if being with her was a dream to which she retorted with asking if her \nmother\n was seen in his dream.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang reunites with \nHope van Dyne\n \n \nTaking a moment to realize his location, Lang freaked out as he knew the \nFBI\n would be on the chase for him. Van Dyne showed him that the \nAnkle Monitor\n was off and that he was safe, but both she and Pym were very mad at him for participating in the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n in \nGermany\n, as it caused her and Pym to be fugitives due to the fact that the \nAnt-Man Suit\n, which was a violation of the \nSokovia Accords\n, was built by and belonged to them, and had to cease communicating with Lang. Lang explained that he was recruited quickly by the Avengers who picked him up, stating \nSteve Rogers\n needed his help.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang tells \nPym\n about destroying the \nsuit\n \n \nWhen they arrive at the \nMobile Laboratory\n, Lang noticed a big structure being built by ants, which Pym and van Dyne mention is a portal to the \nQuantum Realm\n, whose concepts came from one Pym made when he worked at \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n. As they continued to talk, Lang was told that he destroyed the \nAnt-Man Suit\n in case of any suspicion but lied to Pym about destroying it, leaving Pym in such dismay. As he kept on apologizing, Lang mentioned his dream while calling him.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang refuses to get involve with the plan\n \n \nAs Pym and van Dyne noticed his mention of the dream, Lang told them about him being \nJanet van Dyne\n playing hide-and-seek with joy as a young little girl hides away from a dresser. After telling about his dream, Pym and van Dyne had finally gathered a connection that Janet may be alive in the Quantum Realm. To finish their portal, they still needed a component to keep the tunnel from powering up. As Pym and van Dyne are leaving the lab, Lang told them not to involve him with the plan or else he'll end up in prison.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang sees \nHank Pym\n's \nlab\n shrunken down\n \n \nOnce Hope van Dyne explained she'll bring him back to his home, Lang listened to Pym about the entanglement won't last him long enough and needed to move quickly. Lang then asked Pym and van Dyne that he needed to hide inside only for the lab being shrunken down and was told to put on his clothes that van Dyne brought along. To get the component, they drove on a new van from Pym's \ncar collection\n to close a deal with \nSonny Burch\n.\n[\n4\n]\nReturning to Ant-Man\n[\n]\nFirst Encounter with Ghost\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang sees \nWasp\n fighting \nSonny Burch\n's men\n \n \n\"Wings and \nblasters\n. So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.\"\n\"No, I did.\"\nScott Lang and \nHank Pym\n[src]\nWhen they arrived at the \nOui\n, van Dyne revealed she had purchased from Burch, a black-market dealer, the parts she and Pym needed for their Quantum Realm portal. However, van Dyne had been going by a different name, Susan, and Burch mentioned he had learned her real name and relation to Hank Pym, and then he forced her to give him the money. Van Dyne ended up leaving the money without the part, but she quickly fought them off afterward in her \nWasp Suit\n to successfully gain the portal part.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man and the \nWasp\n trying to find \nGhost\n \n \nJust after van Dyne succeeded, a figure known as \nGhost\n appeared and challenged van Dyne for the portal part. Van Dyne was losing, but Lang had no \nsuit\n with him until Pym offered a prototype suit. Ant-Man showed up and aided Wasp into taking down Ghost. She, however, knocked them out and then stole Pym's \nMobile Laboratory\n, which had their lab in it.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang at \nLuis\n' \nX-Con\n office\n \n \nTo find a place to figure out what happened, Lang suggested going to \nX-Con Security Consultants Office\n. \nLuis\n said that there were rumors about someone who could phase through walls, which they saw at the restaurant. They needed help, and although he didn't like it, Pym had a \nformer colleague\n from \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n who could help.\n[\n4\n]\nMeeting Bill Foster\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang, \nvan Dyne\n and \nPym\n visit \nBill Foster\n \n \n\"How big did you get?\"\n\"My record, twenty-one feet. You?\"\n\"Sixty-five feet.\"\n\"Whoa. That's huge.\"\n\"Sixty-five.\"\n\"If you two are finished comparing sizes...\"\nScott Lang, \nBill Foster\n and \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nLang realized that he would soon have to return home so that the \nFBI\n could not find out that he had been breaking house arrest. Pym and van Dyne insisted that they must get the lab back, as it was their only way of finding Janet and rescuing her from the \nQuantum Realm\n. The trio found that the tracker on Pym's lab had been disabled, leaving them with only one option for tracking it. Reluctantly and begrudgingly, they visited Pym's estranged former partner, \nBill Foster\n, at his college office. Foster told Lang that he and Pym used to work together on a project known as \nProject G.O.L.I.A.T.H.\n before Pym discredited Foster and broke off their partnership. Lang saw several FBI agents milling around the campus and suspected that the three of them must have been recognized. They narrowly escaped being arrested, but not before Foster can give them advice on how to track the lab using the regulator from one of Pym's suits.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang talks to \nvan Dyne\n about the \nbattle\n \n \nPym found that the only two suits remaining without a damaged regulator were the new one Lang was using and the one Lang had used in \nGermany\n, which he had promised he had destroyed. Lang confided that he actually did not destroy the second suit, but had kept it safe in case of an emergency inside a trophy \nCassie\n had given him. They found, however, that Cassie had taken the trophy to school for show-and-tell, forcing Lang and van Dyne to sneak into the school and steal the suit out of the trophy. While inside the school, Lang's regulator malfunctioned, causing him to grow and shrink to random sizes, before getting stuck at the height of an elementary schooler. They escaped the school and used the regulator to track down Pym's \nMobile Laboratory\n in the \nGhost\n's \nlair\n, where she knocked them out.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang, \nvan Dyne\n and \nPym\n captured by \nGhost\n \n \nWhen the three came to, the Ghost revealed herself to be Ava Starr, daughter of another of Pym's former partners, \nElihas Starr\n, who died in an accident that occurred while trying to replicate Pym's \nQuantum Tunnel\n after being discredited and fired from the project. The same accident killed Starr's \nmother\n as well but rendered Starr herself quantumly unstable. This meant she was capable of passing through walls and existing in multiple realities at once, though it took a toll on her: her powers were difficult to control and caused her immense pain, and would ultimately kill her if not cured soon. Foster had developed a way of using quantum energy fields to temporarily nullify her powers for periods of time, but they were not as effective anymore and Starr concluded that she would need to harvest \nJanet\n's quantum energy in order to cure herself, even if it killed Janet. Pym refused to let this happen and caused a distraction that allowed the three of them to escape with his lab once again.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang connects with \nJanet van Dyne\n \n \nNow in possession of the part, they were previously missing, Pym and van Dyne were able to open a stable version of the Quantum Tunnel, allowing Janet to send through a full message by temporarily possessing Lang's body. She, through Lang, helped them obtain the exact coordinates to find her in the Quantum Realm, but warned them that they had mere hours before the unstable realm separated them for centuries. Lang was then warned by Luis that Burch had tipped off contact at the FBI as to Lang's location and he was forced to flee home in order for the FBI to find him still under house arrest.\n[\n4\n]\nTricking Woo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is checked on by \nJimmy Woo\n \n \n\"I do some dumb things and the people that I love the most pay the price. Mainly you.\"\nScott Lang to \nCassie Lang\n[src]\nHaving been warned by \nLuis\n, Lang headed back home as quickly as the ant could fly, but not before getting the cold shoulder from van Dyne and Pym for getting them in trouble again. Seeing the \nFBI\n arrive, Lang headed to the bathroom, which was on the highest floor. When Cassie entered looking for him, Lang returned to normal size and asked her to buy some time by telling \nJimmy Woo\n that he was throwing up badly. Quickly changing into his pajamas, Lang feigned vomiting as he heard Woo coming up the stairs. Woo promptly left as there was no evidence of Lang breaking house arrest.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang talking with \nCassie\n \n \nLater, Cassie told him that he needed a partner to watch his back, suggesting herself. However, Lang tells her that he doesn't want her to be part of the dangerous side of his life. He tells her that van Dyne would be a good partner for him. Cassie agreed with him, saying it's a good fit.\n[\n4\n]\nChase for the Mobile Laboratory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang saves \nHank Pym\n and \nHope van Dyne\n \n \n\"Yes! I'm gonna call you \nAnt-tonio Banderas\n!\"\nAnt-Man\n[src]\nMeanwhile, \nHope van Dyne\n and \nHank Pym\n were caught by \nFBI\n agents once they shrink the \nMobile Laboratory\n. Agent \nStoltz\n managed to obtain it, but he was suddenly attacked by \nGhost\n, who then took the lab herself. Lang used the trained ants to help van Dyne and Pym break out of the FBI facility. The \nAnts\n guided the three to the lab's location, and \nLuis\n joined them as a backup.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man fighting against the \nGhost\n \n \nLang, van Dyne and Hank located the lab and used \nants\n to disable the machines so \nGhost\n and \nBill Foster\n would not be able to access the \nQuantum Realm\n. They then draw Ghost out, allowing Hank to go inside the lab. Ant-Man, Wasp and \nLuis\n looking for Ghost. Lang suddenly got attacked by Ghost and the two began to fight. However, the \nAnt-Man Suit\n continued to malfunction, causing him not to be able to escape. This was a distraction for Pym was successful in entering the Quantum Realm, allowing them to shrink the lab and drive off with it.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man rejoining \nHope van Dyne\n and \nLuis\n \n \nLang made his escape and met up with Wasp and Luis at the rendezvous point. As they were driving, van Dyne noticed \nSonny Burch\n approach them with his goons, causing them to chase through \nSan Francisco\n. Lang then joined them in the van as more goons approached on motorbikes. Lang and van Dyne then told Lang to drive as she moved to the back to defeat the goons herself. Lang and Luis then crashed the van, causing Starr to get away from them, but Burch was still chasing after the lab. Van Dyne soon found Starr and attempted to take back the lab and fight her. Lang went to help, leaving Luis behind as he jumped on the front of the truck.\n \n \n \n \n \nGiant-Man chasing after \nSonny Burch\n \n \nLang's suit began to malfunction again causing him to grow big. He then punched Starr in the face, breaking her mask and allowing van Dyne to take back the lab. Lang attempted to stop the truck, which he was successful. He then used the truck to make his way through the streets and reach Burch. Lang and van Dyne then went to help Luis, with Wasp taking out the goons and Lang going for the lab.\n \n \n \n \n \nGiant-Man confronting \nSonny Burch\n \n \nLang, who was still in giant form, crashed Burch's car and then began to chase him on foot, but was not able to catch him due to his size. Burch then made his way onto a ferry and Lang attempted to follow him by calling in an ant, but they kept getting eaten by a seagull. He was able to get further with one ant, but it also got eaten, causing him to fall into the water. He then grew big again and swam after the ferry. He then emerged from the water and grabbed the lab from Burch.\n \n \n \n \n \nScott is kissed by \nHope\n \n \nDue to him being too big for too long, Lang started to lose consciousness as he attempted to return to the lab so they could enlarge it so Pym could get out of the Quantum Realm with \nJanet van Dyne\n. He was able to put the lab on the ground as Wasp and Luis arrived. Van Dyne realized that Lang was losing consciousness and went to save him as he fell into the water. She swam towards him and repaired the regulator, causing him to shrink, allowing her to save him. She took Lang to the surface where he grew back to normal size. He regained consciousness and the two kissed.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man and \nWasp\n arrive to stop the \nGhost\n \n \nAnt-Man and the \nWasp\n showed up and disabled \nBill Foster\n's machine, giving \nHank Pym\n and \nJanet van Dyne\n enough time to come out of the \nQuantum Realm\n. Van Dyne reunites with her mother at last. Janet then sees Starr's problem, and she puts her hands on Starr to stabilize her and stop her phasing. Everyone left as they took the \nMobile Laboratory\n.\n[\n4\n]\nFree Man Again\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is free from his home arrest\n \n \n\"Are my two years over already? What's it like out there? Do people still dance? Are food trucks still a thing?\"\n\"You got away with it this time, Scotty, but I'll be seeing you again.\"\nScott Lang and \nJimmy Woo\n[src]\nBack home, Lang played on his drum set to pass time until \nJimmy Woo\n, again, came to see if he broke house arrest again. When Woo arrives, Lang playfully asked if he was there to tell him his three days were up. Without any evidence to prove he broke house arrest, Woo was forced to remove the \nAnkle Monitor\n. As Woo left, he threatened to see Lang again; however, Lang turned the threat into a joke by asking when.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang goes to see \nCassie\n \n \nNow free, the first thing Lang did was go see \nCassie\n. He was warmly welcomed not only by Cassie, who was happy to see her father free but \nMaggie Lang\n and \nJim Paxton\n as well. Meanwhile, \nX-Con Security Consultants\n obtained new clients; after Luis, Dave and Kurt took down Burch, the new clients keep their business from going under. Lang, van Dyne, and Cassie spend time together in a shrunken car, with a laptop set up akin to an old drive-in theater.\n[\n4\n]\nTrapped in the Quantum Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man about to enter \nQuantum Realm\n \n \n\"Healing particles secured for our new \nghost friend\n.\"\n\"Great.

OK, seriously, don't joke around. Bring me up, let's go. GUYS?!\"\nScott Lang and \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nSometime soon afterwards, Lang arrived at an empty rooftop in \nLuis' Van\n with a portable \nQuantum Tunnel\n for van Dyne and family. Their objective was to extract energy from the \nQuantum Realm\n to be able to continue curing \nAva Starr\n's affliction. Janet warned Lang to steer clear from the carnivorous tardigrades, as well as to not get sucked by a time vortex, because it would be difficult to get him out.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is trapped in the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \nLang went subatomic, harvested the needed energy, and then waited for van Dyne to finish the countdown to return him to the regular world. Suddenly, her comm went static. Thinking they were playing a joke on him, Lang laughed it off. However, when it became apparent they weren't on the other end, he panicked and called out to them frantically.\n[\n4\n]\nJoining the Avengers\n[\n]\nEscape from the Quantum Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is finally freed from \nQuantum Realm\n \n \n\"Hey, kid! \nWhat\n the hell happened here?\"\nScott Lang to a young biker\n[src]\nLang remained trapped in the \nQuantum Realm\n for five hours until he was freed by a \nrat\n that walked across the \nvan\n's hood and accidentally activated its control panel. Finally out of the realm at last, Lang found himself trapped in a \nstorage room\n and saw that \nHope van Dyne\n, \nHank Pym\n, and \nJanet van Dyne\n were nowhere to be seen.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang leaves the \nstorage facility\n \n \nConfused by his surroundings, Lang then asked Hope where she was. He then called for help on a security camera and a security guard saw him and let him go with some of his belongings. Lang escaped the storage room along with some of his belongings, which he took in a wagon with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang frantically explores \nSan Francisco\n \n \nLang then went around exploring the neighborhoods of \nSan Francisco\n, seeing most of it looking post-apocalyptic. While looking around, Lang spotted a boy riding a bicycle and asked him what had happened, but the boy simply ignored him and kept on riding his bike.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang discovers the \nWall of the Vanished\n \n \nLang soon made his way to the city's \nWall of the Vanished\n and discovered that many people had vanished and had their names etched on the memorial. Fearing that his \ndaughter\n's name was on there, Lang went and looked on the plaques hoping not to find her name. Much to his relief, he didn't find her name etched on any of the plaques but instead found his own along with Hope and her parents' names, much to his shock and confusion.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is reunited with his teenage \ndaughter\n \n \nLang ran to his \nex wife\n's \nhouse\n and knocked on the door and rang the doorbell repeatedly. When his daughter answered the door, Lang was relieved to find that she was alive, but was surprised that she was now a teenager. She was relieved to find her father alive as she had believed he was dead. The two reunited in a tearful, joyful reunion and hug while Lang had commented on how big she had gotten.\n[\n6\n]\nAfter his escape, Lang spent many nights crying himself to sleep due to all of the time he had lost with his daughter. He also began experiencing survivor's guilt, questioning why he was spared when so many others were not.\n[\n7\n]\nDiscussing the Quantum Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang arrives at the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"What if we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it?

Like before \nThanos\n.\"\nScott Lang to \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n[src]\nAfter overcoming his survivor's guilt and thinking about his time in the \nQuantum Realm\n,\n[\n7\n]\n Lang drove from \nSan Francisco\n to the \nAvengers Compound\n in \nNew York\n in \nLuis' Van\n. Arriving at the Compound's entrance, Lang called up at the security camera, helpfully reminding anyone watching that they \nfought together\n back a \nfew years ago\n in \nGermany\n; he asked them to let him in and that he really needed to talk to them. Lang was then let inside, and he reunited with \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who were shocked he was alive and wondered if he was okay.\n[\n6\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang explains the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \nOnce inside the Avengers Compound Lang had Rogers and Romanoff explain what he'd missed, and heavy hearts they explained the events of the \nInfinity War\n and its aftermath.\n[\n7\n]\n Afterwards, a frazzled Lang then asked if either Rogers or Romanoff had ever studied Quantum Physics to which Romanoff said she was, only for conversation; so she had a basic grasp of the concept. He then told them about how he got trapped in the Quantum Realm five years ago due to the Snap, making them wonder how he maintained his sanity that long. However, Lang surprised them by explaining that for him, it was actually five hours; hence why he was the same age as he was back in \n2018\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang discusses his time travel theory\n \n \nWhile speaking, Lang noticed a sandwich on the table and rushed to eat it since he was hungry. Rogers then tried to get Lang to clarify what he was saying, so he explained that time worked differently in the Quantum Realm, but there was no way to navigate it. Lang proposed the idea to control the Quantum Realm, entering at one point in time and then exiting at another point in time, to find a way to undo the damage.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang asks who they should ask for help\n \n \nRogers then asked Lang if he was talking about a time machine, to which Lang said he wasn't and that it was something else, but suddenly realized he was talking about a time machine. He told them that he can't stop thinking about it and that it's crazy. However, Romanoff informed him that she gets emails from a \nraccoon\n and that nothing sounded crazy anymore. Lang then asked who they should talk to about this.\n[\n6\n]\nAsking For Assistance\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang arrives to meet \nTony Stark\n at his \nhome\n \n \n\"I know you got a lot on the line.

And you're telling me that won't even\"\n\"That's right, Scott. I won't even. I got a kid.\"\nScott Lang and \nTony Stark\n[src]\nJoining \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, Lang headed off to find \nTony Stark\n, who was living a simple life with his family. Once they had arrived at his \nhome\n, Lang proposed their idea of traveling back in time to collect the \nInfinity Stones\n before \nThanos\n got them and snap their own fingers to bring back everyone who perished in \n2018\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang discusses \ntime travel\n with \nTony Stark\n \n \nStark disagreed with the group's decision to use Quantum energy to mess with time, thinking they'll never be coming back to their original timeline or that it may erase his \ndaughter\n and the new life he found from existence. Once Lang told Stark that he came back from the past, he told Lang that his case was a billion in one chances of a cosmic fluke, thus it could not happen, being told that the group was pulling a \nTime Heist\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang urges \nTony Stark\n to help them out\n \n \nStark continued to tell the group that it was a pipe dream. When Lang sat down with Stark, he told him that they would follow strict rules of time travel, but Stark rejected his proposal with concern about following logic from \nBack to the Future\n. Despite Lang urging Stark to help them try to bring everyone back, Stark still refused, leaving Lang, Rogers, and Romanoff to find someone else with a really big brain, bigger than Stark's.\n[\n6\n]\n While Lang was disappointed by Stark's refusal, he empathized will Stark's fear of losing his daughter.\n[\n7\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang meets a transformed \nBruce Banner\n \n \nThe three then called \nBruce Banner\n to meet with them at a diner. However, to Lang's astonishment and great confusion, Banner was now in complete control of his Hulk alter ego; while physically the Hulk, Banner retained control. Banner laughed off Lang's confusion with the fact that he was now wearing shirts as the Hulk. Lang, still overwhelmed by Hulk speaking and eating like a human, required further explanation.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang listens to \nBruce Banner\n's explanation\n \n \nBanner revealed his guilt about losing twice to \nThanos\n; first as Hulk, then as Banner, and because of that, the Snap happened. He further explained to Lang that after eighteen months in a Gamma Lab, he was able to merge his mind and Hulk's body into one being. At that moment, some kids wanted to take a picture with Banner, so he asked Lang to take the picture, to which he obliged.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang getting turned down to be in a picture\n \n \nAfter he took the photo, Lang asked the kids if they wanted to take a picture with him since he was also a superhero, but quickly changed his mind as he believed they were just Hulk fans and didn't know who he was. He asked Banner to take the phone and even let out a swear as the kids left. Returning to the topic of time travel, Banner said that it was out of his expertise but agreed to do a few tries.\n[\n6\n]\nTesting Time Travel\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang about to test \ntime travel\n in \nLuis' Van\n \n \n\"I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in ten seconds. Makes sense?\"\n\"Perfectly not confusing.\"\n\"Good luck, Scott. You got this.\"\n\"You're right. I do, Captain America.\"\n\nBruce Banner\n, Scott Lang and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nThe four returned to the \nAvengers Compound\n, where they began working on navigating the \nQuantum Realm\n to ensure \ntime travel\n. Lang put on the \nQuantum Realm Exploration Suit\n and waited to be sent through time. When \nBruce Banner\n mentioned not wanting something to go wrong and have Lang stuck in the \n1950s\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n said he was kidding. Banner then told Lang that he would send him back a week and then bring him back in ten seconds to which Lang said was perfectly not confusing.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is accidentally turned into a baby\n \n \nSteve Rogers\n then wished Lang good luck, as they commenced the experiment, and he was sent into the Quantum Realm. Instead of Banner sending Lang through time, he ended up sending time through Lang as he returned as a twelve-year-old, an elderly man, and a baby. Lang was brought back to his normal self when Romanoff killed the power. Returned to his normal form, Lang stated that someone had peed in his pants and he wasn't sure if it was baby him or old him, or just him.\n[\n6\n]\n Lang would later reflect on this experience in his \nmemoir\n, stating that while it was brief, it gave him some perspective on things.\n[\n7\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang meets \nRocket\n and \nNebula\n \n \nAfter their failed experiment, Stark had arrived at the Compound having found a way to perform time travel successfully. Lang later went outside to have some tacos for lunch. When he was about to eat his lunch, Lang's taco was destroyed when the \nBenatar\n landed on the lawn. Lang then saw \nRocket\n and \nNebula\n exiting, and when Rocket asked where Banner was, Lang responded that he was in the kitchen.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is given some tacos by \nBruce Banner\n \n \nAs Nebula walked past him, Lang stated that she looked awesome before she notified \nJames Rhodes\n that Lang was in the landing zone, calling him an \"idiot\". Rhodes then landed very close to Lang, which startled him. He then teased Lang by calling him \"Regular Size Man\" before entering the facility. Seeing this Lang lose his lunch, Banner decided to give him some of his own tacos before flying off.\n[\n6\n]\nTesting the Time Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is fitted into the \nTime Suit\n \n \n\"We go back, we get the \nstones\n before \nThanos\n gets them, Thanos doesn't have the stones! Problem solved!\"\n\"Bingo.\"\n\"That's not how it works.\"\nScott Lang, \nClint Barton\n and \nNebula\n[src]\nOnce all of the \nAvengers\n were assembled, they began working on the method in order to travel through the \nQuantum Realm\n. Lang was being fitted into the \nTime Suit\n by \nBruce Banner\n and \nNebula\n, and when Banner tried to put a \nPym Particle\n into the suit, Lang started to get unnerved and reminded him that since \nHank Pym\n was \ngone\n, they only had limited Pym Particle and they weren't making anymore. However, Lang accidentally triggered the suit, and he shrunk and said he was not ready for the test.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang gets angry about the \nPym Particles\n \n \nClint Barton\n volunteered to do the test run, so Lang gave him the suit to wear. Lang witnessed \nJames Rhodes\n suggest killing \nThanos\n as a baby, which Banner said couldn't work. However, Lang supported Rhodes' idea by stating that they go back in time and get the \nInfinity Stones\n before Thanos. Nebula stated that that's not how time travel works. Lang and Rhodes then listed an array of films that featured \ntime travel\n. However, Banner explained that when traveling back in time, changing the past does not change the future. Surprised and confused, Lang stated that \nBack to the Future\n was a bunch of nonsense.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang learns that \ntime travel\n was a success\n \n \nThey all then went to the hangar to watch the test, with Barton being the first to travel through time in a controlled manner. They all stood together as Barton stood on the platform of the \nQuantum Tunnel\n while Banner prepared to send him into the past. Barton soon returned, and Lang witnessed as Barton threw \nTony Stark\n a mitt that he had acquired from the past after successfully time-traveling.\n[\n6\n]\nTime Heist\n[\n]\nLocating the Infinity Stones\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang during the planning of the \nTime Heist\n \n \n\"\nMorag\n's a planet. \nQuill\n was a person.\"\n\"A planet?

They decided to brief themselves on each stone and the history of where they've been.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang listens to \nThor\n talk about the \nAether\n \n \nLang gleefully listened to \nThor\n while he told them about the \nAether\n and how his \nex-girlfriend\n got it stuck inside her body and that he had to take her to \nAsgard\n, which was where he was from. However, Thor began to get off-topic due to not coming to terms with some of the trauma in his life, including his \nmother\n's death.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang being teased by \nRocket\n \n \nThat night as they all had dinner, \nRocket\n informed the team about the \nPower Stone\n and how \nPeter Quill\n stole it from \nMorag\n, to which Lang was amazed about the prospect of space. Rocket began to tease Lang by patting him on the head and calling him a puppy, mockingly saying that he would take Lang to space.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang listens to \nNebula\n talk about \nVormir\n \n \nNext, \nNebula\n informed them on the \nSoul Stone\n and how \nThanos\n \nkilled\n her \nsister\n on \nVormir\n, making Lang say out loud that he would not be going to that planet. By the third day, the Avengers had finished their brainstorming of the Infinity Stones and planned when and where they would travel to, to get all six stones. They then split the Avengers into small teams, each responsible for a different stone.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nAvengers\n complete their plan\n \n \nThey assigned three teams: \nTony Stark\n, \nSteve Rogers\n, \nBruce Banner\n and Lang going to \n2012\n to get the \nSpace\n, \nMind\n, and \nTime Stones\n, Thor and Rocket going to \n2013\n to get the \nReality Stone\n, and \nClint Barton\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n, \nJames Rhodes\n, and Nebula going to \n2014\n to get the Soul and Power Stones. However, they only had enough Pym Particles to send them back in time and back to the present, meaning that this was their only chance.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang prepares to enter the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \nThe Avengers all then suited up in their \nTime Suits\n and made their way to the platform of the \nQuantum Tunnel\n, where Rogers gave them a speech about everything that had led up to that moment and that this was their only chance to change \nwhat\n had happened. Lang shared with Rocket's surprise on how good Rogers was at giving them a motivational speech. Banner then activated the machine and they were all transported to the \nQuantum Realm\n, where they each traveled to their designated time.\n[\n6\n]\nTheft of the Space Stone\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man arrives in \n2012\n \nNew York City\n \n \n\"\nCap\n.

While \nBruce Banner\n left for the \nTime Stone\n, \nTony Stark\n, Rogers, and Lang went to \nStark Tower\n to retrieve the \nTesseract\n and the \nScepter\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man sees the \nAvengers\n arresting \nLoki\n \n \nArriving at \nStark Tower\n, Lang rode on Stark's shoulder as they quietly infiltrated the building to obtain the \nTesseract\n. While Stark and Lang watched the alternate versions of the \nAvengers\n arresting an \nalternate Loki\n, Stark radioed to Rogers about his alternate self's buttocks being crapped into his former uniform, to which Lang complimented that it was \"America's ass.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nLang asks \nTony Stark\n about \nSTRIKE\n \n \nSubsequently, \nSTRIKE\n arrived to confiscate the \nScepter\n, leaving Stark and Lang to hide out of sight. Lang asked who they were to which Stark informed him that the two lead agents, \nJasper Sitwell\n and \nBrock Rumlow\n, were both \nHYDRA\n agents infiltrating \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, but didn't know it at the time, much to Lang's shock as he claimed that they looked like bad guys before being quieted by Stark. Stark then flicked Lang onto his alternate self in order to get closer to the Tesseract.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man being flicked onto \n2012\n \nTony Stark\n \n \nLang quietly hid onto the alternate Stark, who was transporting the Tesseract, along with STRIKE and the Avengers while Stark departed from the building in the \nIron Man Armor: Mark LXXXV\n and stole a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform to disguise himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man smells body spray from \n2012\n \nStark\n \n \nUnder Stark's orders, Lang went under alternate Stark's shirt, where he smelled Axe body spray, having Stark to explain he had one under a desk for emergencies. While the alternate versions of Stark and \nThor\n argued with an alternate \nAlexander Pierce\n, Stark instructed Lang to shut off the alternate Stark's \nArc Reactor\n to give him a cardiac arrest as a distraction.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man enters \n2012\n \nStark\n's \nArc Reactor\n \n \nLang then damaged it, causing alternate Stark to suffer a heart attack. While alternate Stark had suffered pain from his heart, Lang kicked the case containing the Tesseract to Stark, his actions being noticed by alternate Loki. Unfortunately, just before Stark made it out of the Tower, he was struck by \nalternate Hulk\n, sending both Stark and the Tesseract flying.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man disables \nTony Stark\n's \nArc Reactor\n \n \nLoki used the opportunity to steal the Tesseract and escape captivity, ruining Lang and Stark's mission. Lang then jumped onto Stark and told him that that part of the plan wasn't supposed to happen, leading him to tell Lang that they messed up the plan. Lang and Stark then met back up with Rogers in the alley, who had been successful in retrieving the Scepter.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang upset about their \nmission\n failures\n \n \nUpon meeting with Rogers, Lang complained that the \nTime Heist\n was a complete failure with their blunder of the Tesseract. Lang lectured the group that they only had enough \nPym Particles\n for one journey home and won't be coming back. However, Stark suddenly had an idea and suggested going further back in time to a place where both the Tesseract and more Pym Particles were in the same place. Lang listened while Stark and Rogers discussed where to go to seek the Tesseract.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is given the \nScepter\n by \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nRogers then instructed Lang to take the Scepter back to the \nAvengers Compound\n while he and Stark went to an \nalternate 1970\n. Before they departed, Lang informed them that if they fail again at getting the Tesseract, they won't be coming home, to which Stark thanked him and teased him by calling him \"piss ant\".

Lang made sure to lock on his mask as the rest of the Compound was \nlocked down\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man sees birds appear out of nowhere\n \n \nBanner put on the gauntlet, and though he became overwhelmed by its power, he still managed to snap his fingers. As everyone checked on Banner, Lang walked out of the room and looked at the inner garden and saw a flock of \nbirds\n appear out of nowhere.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man realizes the \nBlip\n worked\n \n \nLang was amazed by the sight and told everyone that he believed the \nBlip\n had worked. At that moment, the Compound was \nbombed\n by an \nalternate Thanos\n and his \nwarship\n. As the missiles obliterated the Compound, Lang shrunk down to survive.\n[\n6\n]\nAttack on the Avengers Compound\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man gets up after the destruction\n \n \n\"We're drowning!

However, \nTony Stark\n informed them that their \nQuantum Tunnel\n had been destroyed. Shrinking back to normal size, Lang then informed them that they could use \nLuis' van\n, which contained a smaller Quantum Tunnel and called on the horn to the van.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is reunited with \nWasp\n in battle\n \n \nHe was then found by \nHope van Dyne\n, who smiled at him, as Stark asked him how long he needed to get the van working, to which he said ten minutes.

Lang accepted and chose to turn the book into a memoir titled \nLook Out for the Little Guy!\n, detailing his journey as a superhero,\n[\n7\n]\n which he later published in \n2025\n.\n[\n22\n]\n In addition to Lang's perspective on super heroics, the book featured a chapter dedicated to \nNatasha Romanoff\n, with \nSteve Rogers\n and Barton reflect on their time with Romanoff.

Lang left the bookstore and met \nHope van Dyne\n at the station to pick up Cassie, discovering that she had shrunk a police car while trying to help a \nBlip\n-displaced homeless camp. As they drove, Lang voiced his disapproval of Cassie's actions, even though he understood he desire to help those in need, as he just wanted her to have a normal life.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang learning about \nCassie Lang\n's secret\n \n \nThey arrived at \nHank Pym\n and \nJanet van Dyne\n's \nhouse\n for dinner, where Lang discovered that Cassie had briefly been in jail once already. This made Lang want to address his daughter's desire to help others, claiming that he didn't want her wasting her life. She then responded by accusing him of no longer doing anything with his, so Lang brought up how he saved the world, causing everyone to tease him about how much he brings that up. Lang then learned that Cassie had been working with Pym and Hope, so they decided to fill him in.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is amazed by \nCassie Lang\n's \ninvention\n \n \nThey all went down to Pym's lab, where Lang noticed an ant farm filled with smart \nants\n building their own tech. Cassie then presented the \nQuantum Satellite\n that she had built with Pym and Hope's help, commenting that its scanning capabilities could have helped her find Lang when he was trapped in the Quantum Realm for five years. Lang was impressed with his daughter, but when Janet discovered that it sends a signal down to the Quantum Realm, she shut it down, much to everyone's confusion.\n[\n21\n]\nAdventure in the Quantum Realm\n[\n]\nMeeting the Freedom Fighters\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang is again stuck in the \nQuantum Realm\n \n \n\"I know you want to help.

As Lang fell, he put on his \nAnt-Man Suit\n and caught Cassie in his giant form before they hit the ground. They then looked around and realized they were in the \nQuantum Realm\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang taken to the \nFreedom Fighters\n's camp\n \n \nLang tried to comfort his daughter that they were going to be fine, but they were then attacked by \ntwo\n creatures. They were rescued by a \ngroup of rogue Quantum Realm inhabitants\n, who then captured them and brought them to their camp, where they were forced to drink the \nOoze\n, which allowed them to understand the people.

Lang told Jentorra that he was just wanting to get back home, and she responded by revealing that their homes had been destroyed because of Kang. Cassie told Jentorra that they could help, so Lang spoke to his daughter in private, telling her that they needed to focus on getting back home, which disappointed Cassie, who accused him of not caring. When Lang mentioned Janet, Jentorra ordered Lang and Cassie to be taken away as Kang would be after them.\n[\n21\n]\nAttacked by M.O.D.O.K.\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man teaching \nStature\n on how to fight\n \n \n\"What?...

While hiding, Lang saw \nJentorra\n being attacked, so he went to help her, but saw that Cassie had already left his side, put her own \nsuit\n on and was fighting the enemies. However, she wasn't able to defeat them all, so Lang rushed in to save her, giving her tips on how to fight when small.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is reunited with \nM.O.D.O.K.\n \n \nAs the \nFreedom Fighters\n were being captured and taken away, Lang and Cassie were targeted by an \nunknown attacker\n, who managed to corner them, and welcomed Lang back to the \nQuantum Realm\n, saying that their fates were forged together. Lang soon realized that the attacker was \nDarren Cross\n, who had become a giant head and was now going by M.O.D.O.K.. Lang was surprised and confused to see M.O.D.O.K., but when he called him Darren, M.O.D.O.K. fired a blast at them, incapacitating Lang and Cassie, who were then taken as prisoners.\n[\n21\n]\nMeeting Kang the Conqueror\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nLang learns about \nM.O.D.O.K.\n's past\n \n \n\"Let me make this easy for you.

They were then joined by \nM.O.D.O.K.\n, who explained what had happened to him when he entered the \nQuantum Realm\n. Lang interrupted the story after realized his name was an acronym and teased him about his tiny legs. M.O.D.O.K. yelled at Lang for ruining his life, and claimed that he was now free.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang given an offer by \nKang the Conqueror\n \n \nKang the Conqueror\n then arrived, and Lang told him that he was making a mistake, lying about calling the \nAvengers\n for backup. However, Kang calmly asked if he had killed Lang, saying that he had killed Avengers before. Kang then commented that both of them had lost a lot of time in their lives, and began to make his offer for them to help each other, bringing up Lang's skills as a thief. Kang revealed that \nJanet van Dyne\n stole his means of escape, and he needed Lang to steal it back for him so that he could stop what was coming, which was \nmore of him\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang agrees to help \nKang the Conqueror\n \n \nKang reiterated that he was Lang's only chance of getting out of the Quantum Realm, but he refused to help. Immediately, Kang used his powers to force Lang against the cell barrier as he told him that his refusal would result in him having to witness Cassie being killed, and then reliving the moment until he would beg for his own death. Lang continued to hold out, even as Kang began tightening his suit around his body, but it was when Kang began to hurt Cassie that he gave in and reluctantly agreed to help him.

However, Lang comforted his daughter by saying that she was the only thing in his life he didn't mess up was her. Lang secretly gave Cassie a \nshrink and grow disc\n and dove into the Core.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man inside of the Probability Storm\n \n \nOnce he reached the Core, Ant-Man went to shrink it, but a duplicate of himself manifested in front of him. M.O.D.O.K. explained that he was currently in a probability storm, meaning that the duplicate was just a possibility of another him as every choice that he could ever make existed all at once. At that moment, countless more duplicates manifested, all confused about their situation, including a duplicate of him that still worked at \nBaskin-Robbins\n. Ant-Man then witnessed one of his duplicates charge at the Core in giant form, only to instantly die.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man attempting to shrink the \nCore\n \n \nAnt-Man and all of the duplicates panicked and ran away. As more duplicates were manifested, Ant-Man was soon drowned underneath them all. But, hearing his daughter call out to him focused Ant-Man, and his duplicates all began working together to pull him upwards to the Core, now all united with a common goal to get back to Cassie. Ant-Man managed to climb to the top of the mountain made of his duplicates, but when he fired a shrink disc, it failed to reduce the size of the Core. The mountain then toppled over, and Ant-Man fell, but he was saved by \nWasp\n. The two managed to remove all of their duplicates, and together they successfully shrunk the core.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man and \nWasp\n trying to attack \nKang\n \n \nAnt-Man and Wasp fell to the ground, and when they got up, Wasp tried to get them to leave, but he revealed that Kang had Cassie as prisoner. \nJanet van Dyne\n joined them and insisted that they leave, assuring Ant-Man that they would rescue Cassie. Kang then arrived, and demanded the core be handed over. Ant-Man demanded that his daughter be freed, as per their deal, but Kang decided to betray them and he stole the Core.

They arrived at Axia, so Ant-Man and \nWasp\n flew out of the ship and they made their approach to the city, with Ant-Man turning into Giant-Man and Wasp standing on his shoulder. As Giant-Man began destroying the \nCelestium\n, he called out Kang for going against their deal.

Giant-Man once again called out Kang, only to witness him commence his escape from the Quantum Realm. Giant-Man rushed to stop Kang, but was only able to briefly penetrate the Celestium's shield. He then came up with an idea for Wasp to throw him at the shield when shrunken down and then turn back into Giant-Man before impact, which worked. With the shield down, Giant-Man was reunited with his daughter, who was also in giant form.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man standing with \nWasp\n and \nStature\n \n \nThey both returned to normal size and were joined by Wasp. The three then headed to the Celestium where Kang was slaughtering many of the Freedom Fighters. Ant-Man, Wasp and Stature attacked Kang together, but weren't able to do much damage, even when Ant-Man turned into giant form and repeatedly hit Kang. As the three recovered, Kang ranted about how powerful he was compared to them, remarking that they only talked to ants. The smart ants arrived, led by Pym, and alongside M.O.D.O.K., they overwhelmed and defeated Kang.\n[\n21\n]\nDefeating Kang the Conqueror\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man awkwardly watching \nM.O.D.O.K.\n die\n \n \n\"You could've gone \nhome\n.

Once M.O.D.O.K. finally passed, \nJanet van Dyne\n told them that she had opened a portal for them to escape through, so they rushed up to the tower.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man is greatly overpowered by \nKang\n \n \nJanet, \nHank Pym\n and \nWasp\n went through the portal, but Ant-Man spotted Kang running towards them, so he instinctively pushed his \ndaughter\n through the portal to save her. Now just Ant-Man and Kang remaining in the \nQuantum Realm\n, Kang made a run for the portal, so Ant-Man tackled him. The two then began to brawl, with Kang immediately overpowering him, and viciously stomping on his helmet. Ant-Man got himself back up and tried to fight back, only to be brutally beaten to the ground repeatedly.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man and \nWasp\n kill \nKang the Conqueror\n \n \nAs Kang continued to beat up Ant-Man, he told him that he could have gone home had he just looked the other way, but now he had no chance of winning. While being pushed against the \nMultiversal Engine Core\n, Ant-Man responded that he didn't have to win, so long as they both lost, and he slammed a bunch of \nPym Particle Discs\n on the Core, destabilizing it. Kang rushed towards the portal, but was blasted away by Wasp who came back through. Ant-Man and Wasp then worked together to knock Kang into the Core, killing him and causing the core to explode.\n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man and \nWasp\n embracing each other\n \n \nIn a great deal of pain, Ant-Man asked Wasp if his daughter was safe, and she told him that she made it safely back \nhome\n.

Ant-Man expressed how touched he was that Wasp came back for him, and the partners embraced each other by resting their heads on one another. Ant-Man told Wasp he loved her, and she reciprocated.

After picking up a cake from \nBaskin-Robbins\n, Lang began to worry whether they had in fact defeated Kang, and if so, did that mean \nsomething worse\n was coming. However, Lang chose to stop thinking about it.\n \n \n \n \n \nLang having dinner with his family\n \n \nBecause he missed a few years of \nCassie Lang\n growing up due to the \nSnap\n, Lang decided to hold a fake birthday party for her at a restaurant with \nHope van Dyne\n, \nHank Pym\n and \nJanet van Dyne\n attending. Cassie remarked on how it wasn't actually her birthday, but Lang told her that he wanted to make up for the time that he had missed with her. As Lang happily looked upon his family all together, he assured himself that he had definitely seen that last of Kang and that everything would be fine.\n[\n21\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"You're welcome for all not being dust.\"\nScott Lang to \nHank Pym\n, \nJanet van Dyne\n, and \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nScott Lang is an affable rogue with tongue-in-cheek humor. Despite his criminal activity, Lang is a man of honor, good morals, and justice, though to the point of being stubborn, with it being his sense of honor that had led him to his break-in at \nVistaCorp\n, where Lang avenged all the people the corrupt corporation wronged. Lang's desire to right wrongs was often the motivation for his illegal activities, yet his love for his \ndaughter\n, Cassie, also made him determined to go straight upon his release from \nSan Quentin State Prison\n. Lang only went back to criminal activities when his criminal record ostracized him and gave him no other choice in supporting his daughter. Lang will \"do the wrong thing for the right reason\", which is why he joined \nCaptain America\n's team during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, seeing Rogers' point of view on the \nSokovia Accords\n far more just and honorable than \nTony Stark\n's.\nLang also had the drive to prove himself worthy, as he felt he didn't deserve the admiration of his daughter Cassie. In fact, Lang was initially unwilling to take up the mantle of Ant-Man from \nHank Pym\n due to his own fears of having used the \nsuit\n. But upon a chat with the former hero, Lang realized he had a chance to become the hero that his daughter already thought he was.\nDespite being a thief, Lang is a big fan of the \nAvengers\n, admiring their heroism deeply. Although he shared the same dislike of \nTony Stark\n as his mentor, Lang was quick to request they ask the Avengers for help to deal with Darren Cross. Rather than trying to fight \nFalcon\n, a member of the Avengers, immediately, Lang tried to reason with him, attempting to no avail to appeal to the Avenger's desire to protect the world, and apologized for having to \nfight\n and harm him. He is a particular fan of \nCaptain America\n, calling it an honor to meet him and was awestruck towards Rogers, shaking his hand for too long and babbled before Rogers brought him back to reality. Lang's respect for Rogers was so great that he allowed him and \nBucky Barnes\n to escape by creating a distraction which he implied could have killed him, and knowing that even if he survived he would've been captured. In addition, although \nBlack Widow\n was his enemy during the conflict, Lang showed reluctance and regret that he would have to fight her.\nLang also had a considerable dislike towards \nTony Stark\n and the latter's attitude. This was highlighted when he was interviewed on \nWHiH World News\n, as when \nChristine Everhart\n said he that he was \"no Tony Stark\", Lang was relieved at the news, genuinely desiring to be nothing like Stark. This was highlighted once again during the \nAvengers Civil War\n. Prior to the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, he reacted with alarm and distrust to Stark's name. Lang also takes great pleasure in mocking Stark and battling against him; whilst shrunken down during the Civil War, he started disabling Stark's \nMark XLVI Armor\n from the inside and implied he didn't have a conscience despite the fact that not saying anything may have allowed Lang to do more damage without being detected. When he was later imprisoned in the \nRaft\n, he again mocked Stark to his face saying that Pym was right not to trust Stark's family. The fact that Stark asked him who he is was a severe blow to Lang's ego. However, after Lang escaped the \nQuantum Realm\n by sheer happenstance five years after the \nSnap\n, he sought out Stark's help in reversing it and worked with him as his partner during the \nTime Heist\n, appearing to let go of his dislike towards him. After Stark sacrificed himself to defeat \nThanos\n, Lang recognized him as a hero and knelt down along with the other heroes out of respect, later attending his funeral with a somber look.\nSince being put under house arrest after escaping the Raft, Lang had time to prioritize what was important in his life. He respected Hank Pym enough to hide the \nAnt-Man Suit\n instead of destroying it; he also refused to attempt contacting them as by using the \nPym Particles\n in the \nAvengers Civil War\n, it put him on the Most Wanted list. Lang learned \nUp Close Magic\n and set up imaginary heists and getaways throughout his apartment as entertainment for his daughter. He also used his former thief skills to set up \nX-Con Security Consultants\n with Luis and the rest of his buddies, now creating security systems instead of bypassing them. Lang retained a romantic interest in Hope, a woman who he respected for both her intelligence and fighting skills; as Lang put it, if he was going to have a partner, there was no one else he would want but Hope (professionally and romantically).\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"When you're small, energy's compressed, so you have the force of a 200-pound man behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide. You're like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone. Too soft, it's a love tap.\"\n\nHope van Dyne\n to Scott Lang\n[src]\nAnt-Man Suit\n Capabilities\n: In need of a new Ant-Man for his \nheist\n, \nHank Pym\n tricked Lang into breaking into \nPym's house\n and stealing the \nAnt-Man Suit\n. After some practicing, Lang became very good with the technology and used it to complete the heist. He then kept the suit.\nSize Manipulation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man shrinking down into small size\n \n \n Using technology developed by \nHank Pym\n, Lang is able to reduce himself to approximately the size of an ant, though he can also grow his body to gigantic sizes. He still maintains his regular-sized strength and resilience when shrinking; while in reduced scale, this translates to granting him inhuman effort and exertion capabilities. Also, obtaining momentum and kinetic energy in small scale and exerting it immediately while returning to or right after returning to normal size can result in a feat of superhuman effort and exertion, and therefore, momentarily give Lang enhanced strength while in regular size, enough to send a man flying while attacking and enlarging himself at the same time. The process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around the target that charge the target with momentum. Initially, Lang could not maintain his giant transformation for extended periods time, as it causes some heavy stress on his body and if done long enough he can even faint. However, Lang seemed to be getting used to it the more times he does it, and instead of fainting he only gets very exhausted; by the time of \nBattle of Earth\n, Lang remained most of the conflict in giant form without fainting, exhausting, or showing any major drawback.\nSuperhuman Strength\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nGiant-Man knocking down a \nLeviathan\n \n \n While wearing the \nAnt-Man Suit\n in its miniature form, Lang possesses superhuman strength due to his increased density, effort, and exertion, enabling him to take out multiple opponents of normal \nhuman\n size while shrunk. He can also use the physical force and momentum attained from changing size to simulate superhuman strength directly after returning to normal size. This strength also extends to legs, allowing him to jump, spring, and leap across with great force. This allows him to move through the air like a bullet to strike and impact opponents and incapacitate them instantly or move halfway across a room in a single bound. However, exerting too much force into impacts and physical attacks can accidentally kill an opponent, due to the force of attacks being comparable to that of a bullet. The process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around Lang that charge the target with enough momentum that can briefly enhance the target's strength while enlarging or immediately after enlarging. In his enlarged form, Lang's strength enables him to crush huge vehicles, tear a passenger plane apart, punch a \nLeviathan\n into the ground, crush \nCull Obsidian\n by stomping him into the ground, killing him.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man taking missiles from \nWar Machine\n \n \n While wearing the \nAnt-Man Suit\n in its miniature form, Lang's increased density also affords him superhuman durability, retaining the resilience of a human of regular size. This notably allows him to withstand impacts that would easily stun or even kill a normal human, enough to him to fall from great heights and crash onto a surface with the force of a bullet, leaving a bullet hole like a crater in the surface while he remains unharmed. When he has increased his size into a giant-sized man, he naturally becomes far tougher and more durable than normal. This is due to his increased density and muscle mass, and it was enough to withstand missiles from \nWar Machine\n. However, this enormous amount of durability comes at the cost of his speed and balance, making his movements somewhat clumsy as a result.\nInsect Manipulation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man controlling many ants at once\n \n \n Lang, through the use of the \nEMP Communication Device\n within the suit's helmet and the earpieces given to him by \nHank Pym\n, can affect the pheromones of insect-sized organisms and stimulate their olfactory nerve centers, allowing him a rudimentary form of control over ants. He can direct their actions and behavior at will to cause them to work together, such as by forming themselves into bridges or walkways, allowing themselves to be used as mounts, or attacking a target, usually in swarms as a distraction for the user.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"\nVista\n's security system was one of the most advanced in the business. It was supposed to be unbeatable. But you beat it.\"\n\nHank Pym\n to Scott Lang\n[src]\nMaster Thief\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nLang breaking into \nPym Residence\n \n \n Lang was highly trained in theft, specializing in breaking into homes or facilities and other places to steal, even some of the most advanced facilities in the world like \nVistaCorp Headquarters\n, \nAvengers Compound\n and \nPym Technologies Headquarters\n. He has shown to break into \nVistaCorp Headquarters\n, \nGeoff Zorick's Mansion\n, \nPym Residence\n, \nAvengers Compound\n, \nPym Technologies Headquarters\n, \nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n, \nBrookemont Elementary School\n and \nGhost's Hideout\n. He is also highly skilled in utilizing chemistry when opening locked safes and bypassing security systems.\n\"You taught me that kick. Remember?\"\n\"Yeah, great form.\"\nAnt-Man and \nWasp\n[src]\nExpert Martial Artist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man fighting against \nGhost\n \n \n Initially, Lang had limited fighting skills as he avoided confrontations during his heists. \nHope van Dyne\n trained him and he slowly became a highly skilled fighter. His fighting style includes \nMuay Thai\n, \nBrazilian Jiu-jitsu\n, \nJudo\n and \nkickboxing\n. His skills, combined with the \nAnt-Man Suit\n, and shrinking powers, allowed him to defeat armed security personnel and keep with both \nFalcon\n and \nBlack Widow\n in his respective duels with them, despite her being a supremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. Two years later, Scott retained his training and used it in a fight against \nGhost\n at the \nOui\n in conjunction with van Dyne, and the latter even commended his form when he caught her fist and kicked her to the floor. During his battle with \nKang\n, he was easily outmatched due to the latter being a superior fighter. However, Lang trades and counters a few blows to deliver some long enough to keep him away from escaping the quantum realm and getting close to the \nMultiversal Engine Core\n to plant his Pym Particle discs before aided by Wasp which allowed him to throw one strike that subdues the conquer.\n\"You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast.\"\n\nHank Pym\n to Scott Lang\n[src]\nExpert Acrobat\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nAnt-Man knocking down \nSpider-Man\n \n \n Lang is adept in acrobatics, parkour and free running maneuvers, leaping across steep divides and climbing difficult structures. He does not just perform these stunts in his shrunken state, but also when breaking into houses while in the process of thievery.\n\"Maybe he's an idiot savant.\"\n\nHank Pym\n to Scott Lang\n[src]\nGifted Intellect\n: Lang possesses above average intelligence, as he was able to figure out how to use the highly complex \nAnt-Man Suit\n and gain a master's degree in electrical engineering, along with bypassing the security of \nHank Pym\n's home.\n\"The Qubit generates a new combination every 1.5 seconds. Scott broke past it because he was able to read the pattern and predict which combination would come next.\"\n\nHank Pym\n to \nHope van Dyne\n[src]\nExpert Tactician\n: Lang has a keen mind for formulating elaborate plans and schemes, and is especially notable for being able to modify those plans to adapt to unforeseen circumstances at short notice - sometimes within seconds. Examples include when he discovers the fingerprint scanner in \nHank Pym\n's home, when he discovers that the warehouse he is breaking into is actually now the \nAvengers Compound\n, when he is discovered by \nFalcon\n, and when \nDarren Cross\n tripled security on the Pym Technologies building, in all of these situations he was able to improvise and solve these problems quickly and effectively. He, alongside \nHope van Dyne\n and \nHank Pym\n, worked together on creating the heist mission to stop Darren Cross and steal the \nYellowjacket Suit\n. He later orchestrated the breakout of Hope and Hank from police captivity. Lang has quite a good understanding of chemistry. He poured water in the locking mechanism of Pym's 1910 Carbondale safe and froze it with nitrogen, knowing it would expand but the steel would not.\n\"Look man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, alright? I'm gonna be fine.\"\nScott Lang to \nLuis\n[src]\nExpert Engineer\n: Lang was an electrical engineer, having earned a master's degree in the subject. He was formerly employed by VistaCorp as one of the chief engineers.\n\"He hacks into the security system and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.\"\n\"Posts all the bank records online.\"\n\nLuis\n and \nDave\n[src]\nMaster Hacker\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nLang hacking the systems of \nVistaCorp\n \n \n As one of the chief engineers of \nVistaCorp\n, an international cybersecurity and data storage conglomerate, Lang possessed a large amount computer programming and hacking skills. Lang was able to create and improve the security systems for VistaCorp Headquarters and easily corrected and fixed a program that made the company overcharge customers in their transactions. Lang was even able to hack the systems of VistaCorp Headquarters, stealing nearly four million dollars and paying back the money to VistaCorp's customers, even \nHank Pym\n was impressed by his skill in hacking as VistaCorp Headquarters has one of the most advanced security systems in the world.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\n\"In the right hands, the relationship between man and \nsuit\n is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power.\"\n\nHank Pym\n[src]\nAnt-Man Suit\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nLang in his third suit\n \n \n The suit can manipulate its wearer's size while simultaneously enhance both the wearer's density and strength. He originally wore \nHank Pym\n's suit before wearing a new one for the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n and later wore a third suit when he partnered with the \nWasp\n and joined the \nAvengers\n. Lang acquired a fourth suit during his newfound popularity, presumably \nnanotechnology\n as it can be contained in a small disc which rapidly expands on his chest.\nEMP Communication Device\n: Within the suit's helmet and in the form of earpieces developed by \nHank Pym\n, allowing for the control of ants.\nPym Particle Discs\n: About the size of a coin and shaped like a triskelion-styled shuriken, the disks are filled with specified forms of \nPym Particles\n. Targets impacted by \nRed Disks\n shrinks to the size of an insect. Targets impacted by \nBlue Disks\n enlarges to a bigger size.\nAnkle Monitor\n: In the aftermath of the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, Lang was charged for using Hank Pym's technology which were against the \nSokovia Accords\n and was sentenced to serve two years under house arrest while ordered by the FBI to wear a tracker for monitoring his daily routines and positions.\nQuantum Realm Exploration Suit\n: Lang wore this suit when he and the Avengers were performing a test to see if \ntime travel\n through the Quantum Realm is possible.\nTime Suit\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nLang's time travel apparel\n \n \n This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.\nVehicles\n[\n]\nLuis' Van\n: In \n2015\n, Lang rode in the van with his friends, \nLuis\n, \nDave\n, and \nKurt Goreshter\n. In \n2018\n, Lang used the van to house a smaller portable \nQuantum Tunnel\n. The van, however, was eventually destroyed by \nThanos\n during the \nBattle of Earth\n.\nFacilities\n[\n]\nVistaCorp Headquarters\n: During his early career as an electrical engineer, he was a chief engineer for \nVistaCorp\n who was doing shady business with their customers and illegally fraud them with overcharge bills.\nApartment\n: Prior to his incarceration, Lang lived with his then-wife, \nMaggie\n, and daughter, \nCassie\n, in this apartment.\nBaskin-Robbins\n: Once being released from prison, Lang briefly worked as a cashier at Baskin-Robbins until the manager learned of his criminal record and had him fired.\nJim Paxton's House\n: Lang resided in the house along with his wife, \nMaggie\n, and his daughter, \nCassie\n until the divorce. In \n2015\n, Lang visited the house to see Cassie during her birthday, to wish her a good night, to rescue her from \nYellowjacket\n, and was invited later for dinner. In \n2018\n, Lang went to the house after his house arrest was over. In \n2023\n, Lang went to the house to see if Cassie was alive and had an emotional reunion with her. Later, he and Cassie were joined by \nHope van Dyne\n and watched celebratory fireworks.\nThe Milgrom Hotel\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nLang with Dave and Kurt\n \n \n After Lang's release, he was invited by his former cellmate \nLuis\n to live with him and his two colleagues, \nKurt Goreshter\n and \nDave\n, in this low-end hotel until he found enough money to afford a new apartment.\nPym Residence\n: Lang broke into Hank Pym's house and steal anything valuable, but only the \nAnt-Man Suit\n before he returned it to back until he was arrested again. Once Hank aided his escape, Lang takes upon the residence with Hank and his daughter, \nHope\n.\nAvengers Compound\n: In \n2015\n, Lang retrieved a device from the Facility's storage unit.

He also had a relationship with \nJessica Jones\n with Jessica's best friend \nCarol Danvers\n acting as their matchmaker.\nHis Giant-Man persona doesn't exist in the Earth-616 (mainstream) continuity, but rather on Earth-1610, the \nUltimates\n comics. Here, Lang never became Ant-Man, but inherits from \nHank Pym\n the title of Giant-Man, a super-soldier working for \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\nScott Lang is the first character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to have taken over the mantle of a former superhero, followed by \nRobbie Reyes\n, \nHope van Dyne\n and \nSam Wilson\n.\nAnt-Man is one of the three heroes, to have defeated the main antagonist of their first standalone movie without any assistance, the other two being \nHulk\n and \nSpider-Man\n.\nScott Lang is a fan of the baseball team, the \nSan Francisco Giants\n.\n[\n7\n]\nBehind the Scenes\n[\n]\nBefore \nPaul Rudd\n was cast as Ant-Man, \nAdrien Brody\n, \nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\n, \nSimon Pegg\n and \nEwan McGregor\n were all in the running for the role.\nColin Follenweider\n, \nMark Wagner\n, \nBrett Smrz\n, \nMarlow Warrington-Mattei\n and \nJames Harris\n were stunt doubles for \nPaul Rudd\n in the role of Ant-Man.\nMichael Aaron Milligan\n, \nBrian Simpson\n and \nKevin Marshall\n were stand-ins for \nPaul Rudd\n in the role of Ant-Man.\nAccording to \nAndy Park\n, in the early stages of development of \nCaptain America: Civil War\n, Lang was meant to side with \nIron Man\n during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, like \nHank Pym\n in the original \nCivil War\n comic book storyline. This was later changed as the script evolved.\n[\n23\n]\nScreenwriters \nChristopher Markus\n and \nStephen McFeely\n later revealed that had \nSony\n declined \nMarvel Studios\n the use of \nSpider-Man\n, Lang would have been on the opposite team.\n[\n24\n]\nReferences\n[\n]\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of images and media related to \nAnt-Man\n.\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of quotes related to \nAnt-Man\n.\n \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n1.4\n \n1.5\n \n1.6\n \n1.7\n \nAnt-Man - Scott Lang: Small Time\n\n \nThe underlined portion of the name indicates that it is not confirmed and is applied via the \nConjecture Policy\n.\n \n3.00\n \n3.01\n \n3.02\n \n3.03\n \n3.04\n \n3.05\n \n3.06\n \n3.07\n \n3.08\n \n3.09\n \n3.10\n \n3.11\n \n3.12\n \n3.13\n \n3.14\n \n3.15\n \n3.16\n \n3.17\n \n3.18\n \n3.19\n \n3.20\n \n3.21\n \n3.22\n \n3.23\n \n3.24\n \n3.25\n \nAnt-Man\n \n4.00\n \n4.01\n \n4.02\n \n4.03\n \n4.04\n \n4.05\n \n4.06\n \n4.07\n \n4.08\n \n4.09\n \n4.10\n \n4.11\n \n4.12\n \n4.13\n \n4.14\n \n4.15\n \nAnt-Man and the Wasp\n \n5.0\n \n5.1\n \n5.2\n \n5.3\n \n5.4\n \n5.5\n \nCaptain America: Civil War\n \n6.00\n \n6.01\n \n6.02\n \n6.03\n \n6.04\n \n6.05\n \n6.06\n \n6.07\n \n6.08\n \n6.09\n \n6.10\n \n6.11\n \n6.12\n \n6.13\n \n6.14\n \n6.15\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n \n7.00\n \n7.01\n \n7.02\n \n7.03\n \n7.04\n \n7.05\n \n7.06\n \n7.07\n \n7.08\n \n7.09\n \n7.10\n \n7.11\n \n7.12\n \n7.13\n \n7.14\n \n7.15\n \n7.16\n \n7.17\n \n7.18\n \n7.19\n \n7.20\n \nLook Out for the Little Guy!\n \n8.0\n \n8.1\n \n8.2\n \nAvengers: Doomsday | Now in Production\n\n \nWHIH Newsfront: 1.05: WHIH EXCLUSIVE: Scott Lang Interview\n\n \nAvengers: Infinity War Prelude, Issue 1\n\n \nAvengers: Infinity War\n\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n \nDeleted Scene\n\n \nHawkeye: 1.03: Echoes\n\n \nHawkeye: 1.06: So This Is Christmas?\n\n \nThor: Love and Thunder\n\n \nHawkeye: 1.02: Hide and Seek\n\n \nHawkeye: 1.01: Never Meet Your Heroes\n \n18.0\n \n18.1\n \nMs. Marvel: 1.01: Generation Why\n\n \nMs. Marvel: 1.04: Seeing Red\n\n \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.02: Superhuman Law\n \n21.00\n \n21.01\n \n21.02\n \n21.03\n \n21.04\n \n21.05\n \n21.06\n \n21.07\n \n21.08\n \n21.09\n \nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n\n \nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\n \nCivil War Concept Art Reveals Iron Mans Team Almost Featured GIANT MAN/ANT-MAN\n\n \nWhy Ant-Man Was Originally Team Iron Man In Captain America: Civil War\nExternal Links\n[\n]\n \nScott Lang\n on \nMarvel Database\n \nScott Lang\n on \nWikipedia\n \nScott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\n on \nWikipedia\n \nAnt-Man\n on \nMarvel.com\n \nAvengers\nCaptain America\n  \nIron Man\n  \nBlack Widow\n  \nHulk\n  \nThor\n  \nHawkeye\n  \nQuicksilver\n  \nWanda Maximoff\n  \nVision\n  \nWar Machine\n  \nFalcon\n  \nSpider-Man\n  \nCaptain Marvel\n  \nNebula\n  \nRocket\n  \nOkoye\n  \nAnt-Man\n"
