The \nGuardians\n must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of \nPeter Quill\n's true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes' aid as the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n continues to expand.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\nIn \n1980\n, \nMeredith Quill\n is courted by \nEgo\n who shows her an alien seedling he had planted in the woods of \nMissouri\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThirty-four years later\n, the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n are renowned as heroes after defeating \nRonan the Accuser\n. They accept a job from \nAyesha\n, leader of the \nSovereign\n, to defend valuable batteries from an \nAbilisk\n in exchange for \nNebula\n, whom the Sovereign captured following the \nBattle of Xandar\n. After defeating the Abilisk, \nRocket\n steals several of the \nAnulax Batteries\n for himself, and when the Sovereign discover this, they attack the Guardians' ship, the \nMilano\n, with their own fleet of \nOmnicrafts\n. The \nMilano\n is heavily damaged and forced to crash-land on a nearby planet, but the \nSovereign fleet\n is single-handedly destroyed by Ego, who reveals himself as \nPeter Quill\n's father. Ego invites Quill to return to his home, accompanied by \nGamora\n and \nDrax the Destroyer\n. Rocket and \nGroot\n remain to repair the \nMilano\n and guard Nebula.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAyesha hires \nYondu\n, who has been exiled from the greater \nRavager\n community for trafficking children, to recapture the Guardians. Udonta's crew track down the \nMilano\n and capture Rocket, but when Udonta shows reluctance to turn Quill over to the Sovereign, \nTaserface\n leads a mutiny with help from Nebula, who tricked Groot into freeing her. Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Ego, along with Egos empathic assistant Mantis, travel to Egos home, a living planet that is an extension of his body. Ego explains that he is a \nCelestial\n who created a humanoid avatar to travel the galaxy and interact with other species. Quill soon learns he can access and manipulate the power within Egos planet. Drax becomes friendly with \nMantis\n, who wants to reveal a secret about Ego.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTaserface imprisons Rocket and Udonta aboard the \nEclector\n and turns Groot into a mascot for the crew, while Nebula takes a ship and leaves, planning to track down and kill Gamora, blaming her for the torturous cybernetic enhancements inflicted by her father \nThanos\n. In their imprisonment, Rocket and Udonta discover they are very alike, and Udonta shares his low opinion of Ego, who originally hired Udonta's Ravagers to deliver Quill after his mothers death. He reveals to Rocket that he decided to keep Quill safe in his own way, instead of handing him over to Ego. Groot attempts to steal a new \nYaka Arrow Controller\n for the \nYaka Arrow\n to aid an escape attempt, and is helped by \nKraglin Obfonteri\n, a Ravager loyal to Udonta. Together, Rocket, Groot, Udonta, and Obfonteri escape in a detachable section and engage in a risky space maneuver to reach Ego's planet in time to help Quill. Taserface alerts the Sovereign of the escape before Udonta kills him and the Ravager mutiny.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNebula arrives at Egos planet and tries to kill Gamora. Gamora survives and reaches an uneasy truce, and together, she and Nebula explore the caverns beneath Egos planet and discover hundreds of skeletal remains. Ego reveals his master plan to Quill: he traveled the universe and, finding the life-forms he found 'disappointing', he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that would terraform them into new extensions of Ego, but he needed a second Celestials power to activate the seedlings, so he conceived children with hundreds of women all across the galaxy and hired Udonta's Ravagers to collect them. Every other child was killed when they proved unable to access Celestial power, but Quill can harness the power, and Ego uses him to activate all the seedlings, which begin their terraforming that will eventually consume every world and every person. Quill is hypnotized by Egos power until Ego reveals he deliberately caused the death of Quills mother, prompting Quill to fight back.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMantis informs Gamora, Drax, and Nebula of Egos plan just as Rocket, Groot, Udonta, and Obfonteri arrive. Reunited, the Guardians fight their way through a fleet of Sovereign drones, as well as Ego himself, to reach the core of Egos planet where a thick shell protects the Ego's brain. Groot plants a bomb made from the stolen Sovereign batteries on Egos brain, and most of the Guardians escape while Quill remains to battle his father using his access to Egos celestial power. When the bomb explodes, Ego melts away and the planet starts collapsing. Udonta flies in and saves Quill, but sacrifices himself to keep Quill safe, as he has come to view him as an adopted son, much to Quills sadness. Later, Nebula reconciles with Gamora but chooses to leave to kill Thanos anyway. The Guardians cremate Udonta's remains and release his ashes into space. Suddenly, a swarm of Ravager ships appears and surround the Guardians' ship. It turns out that Rocket sent word about Udonta's sacrifice and all the Ravagers came to perform a traditional Ravager funeral for Udonta, signifying his acceptance back into the Ravagers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfterwards\n: Obfonteri takes up Yaka Arrow and controller and tries to master it, only to end up non-fatally impaling Drax; \nStakar Ogord\n is moved by the death of Udonta, his good friend and former teammate, and reunites with his former \nteammates\n \nAleta Ogord\n, \nMartinex\n, \nCharlie-27\n, \nMainframe\n, and \nKrugarr\n; Ayesha, now imprisoned by her fellow Sovereign for wasting resources in her hunt for the Guardians, is seen with a \nBirth Pod\n, containing a male being inside, that she decides to name '\nAdam\n', in response to her fellow Sovereign questioning her about said machine; \nyears later\n, Groot continues growing back to normal size, exhibiting typical teenage behavior in the process, to Quill's chagrin; and the \nWatcher Informant\n discusses his experiences on \nEarth\n along with a group of \nWatchers\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nChris Pratt\n as \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nWyatt Oleff\n as Young \nPeter Quill\nZoe Saldana\n as \nGamora\nDave Bautista\n as

\nKevin Feige\n announced the change on October 28, 2014, \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n was slated for July 28, 2017.\n[\n4\n]\nOn June 2, 2015, \nJames Gunn\n revealed on his Twitter account that the first draft of \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n had been done.\n[\n5\n]\nIn a live periscope session, James Gunn confirmed that \nTyler Bates\n would return to score \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\nVia Facebook, James Gunn confirmed on February 17, 2016, that principal photography had begun and that \nKurt Russell\n would play Peter Quill's \nfather\n, but not \nJ'son of Spartax\n.\nOn April 16, Gunn confirmed that both \nJohn C. Reilly\n and \nBenicio del Toro\n will not return in \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n as \nRhomann Dey\n and the \nCollector\n, respectively.\nOn May 11, \nKurt Russell\n officially finished shooting his scenes.\n[\n6\n]\nOn June 10, \nPom Klementieff\n announced she officially finished shooting her scenes.\n[\n7\n]\nOn June 14, \nZoe Saldana\n had officially finished shooting her scenes.\n[\n8\n]\nOn June 17, \nChris Pratt\n officially finished shooting his scenes.

The cast assemblage ended with the revelation that \nKurt Russell\n would portray \nEgo the Living Planet\n, solving the mystery of the parentage of \nPeter Quill\n.\nAs Ego the Living Planet was officially considered a \nFantastic Four\n character, the movie rights to the character initially belonged to \n20th Century Fox\n. On November 14, 2016, Paul Wernick and James Gunn revealed that Marvel Studios had agreed on a deal where Fox would surrender the movie rights to Ego in exchange for being allowed to alter \nNegasonic Teenage Warhead\n's powers (intending to use the character in \nDeadpool\n).
