In the aftermath of \nCaptain America: Civil War\n, \nScott Lang\n grapples with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father. As he struggles to rebalance his home life with his responsibilities as Ant-Man, he's confronted by \nHope van Dyne\n and Dr. \nHank Pym\n with an urgent new mission. Scott must once again put on the \nsuit\n and learn to fight alongside The Wasp as the team works together to uncover secrets from their past.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \n1987\n, \nJanet van Dyne\n shrinks between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, disabling it but permanently entering the microscopic \nQuantum Realm\n. \nHank Pym\n raises their daughter \nHope\n believing that Janet is dead.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \nthe present day\n, \nScott Lang\n spends time with his daughter Cassie. Although he was arrested and imprisoned for \nhelping\n \nCaptain America\n during a \nskirmish\n between the \nAvengers\n in violation of the \nSokovia Accords\n, Lang took a plea bargain and was allowed to return to the USA. Lang was sentenced to two years under house arrest, with a twenty-year minimum prison sentence waiting if he leaves his home during his sentence or defies the Sokovia Accords again. As Pym and Hope had provided Lang with the technology he used against the Avengers, the United Nations ruled them to have also breached the Accords. A warrant for their arrest was issued, forcing the two to go on the run while severing all contact with Lang.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his time on house arrest, Lang kept himself busy (including learning close-up magic). He also sets up a \nsecurity company\n with his friends \nLuis\n, \nDave\n, and \nKurt Goreshter\n to earn an honest income. With just three days left until his release from house arrest, Lang has a dream where he relives one of Janet's memories of when Hope was a child. Despite not wanting to jeopardize his release, Lang contacts Pym on a phone he'd hidden away and leaves a voicemail about the dream, before deciding he sounds like an idiot, going on to apologize for all the trouble he landed on them. Lang smashes the phone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat night, as Lang relaxes, he notices something buzzing nearby, before being suddenly knocked out. When he wakes up, Lang finds he has been kidnapped by Hope, who left an enlarged ant as a decoy to avoid suspicion from \nFBI\n agent \nJimmy Woo\n. Hope is upset with Lang for using the Ant-Man suit and helping Captain America without telling her, as well as forcing her and her father into hiding. She tells Scott that his dream coincided with Pym briefly opening a quantum tunnel.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeeing the message as confirmation that Janet is alive, Pym and Hope work in their new lab (which Pym can shrink whenever they need to move) to create a stable tunnel, with the intention that Hope will take a vehicle into the Quantum Realm and retrieve Janet. Lang reunites with Pym, who is also very bitter toward Scott for his actions. However, Pym sets his grudge aside as he and Hope decide Lang is their only hope of locating Janet's coordinates in the Quantum Realm.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHope arranges to buy a part needed for the tunnel from the black market dealer \nSonny Burch\n, however, Burch has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym and Hope's research and double-crosses them. Hope then reveals she has a shrinking suit of her own, one which can fly and has blasters, and uses it to fight Burch and his men off and retrieve the part. Before Hope can leave, however, she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman, referred to as the \nGhost\n. Lang tries to help fight off the Ghost with a prototype suit and they keep hold of the part, but Ghost escapes with Pym's portable lab.\nLang announces that he can get them some help. Pym argues with Lang, but eventually agrees to meet with \nX-Con Security Consultants\n. After talking, they decide to ask Pym's former partner, \nBill Foster\n, for help in locating the lab. They go to \nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n to meet with the Professor. He argues with his former partner about their differences that eventually led to them splitting up. Meanwhile, Woo gets a lead on Pym and arrives at the college. Foster tells them that if they modify the diffraction units on one of their regulators, they can maybe locate the lab. They thank him and quickly leave before Woo meets with Foster, who tells them he hasn't talked to Pym in years.\nIn the van, an annoyed Pym says that he got rid of the regulators with the new suit. Lang realizes that he still has his old suit that does have a regulator. They call Luis who tells them that the trophy it is being kept in isn't at the house. Lang remembers that \nCassie Lang\n took it to school that day for show and tell. Ant-Man and the Wasp break into the school and grab the suit. However, Ant-Man's prototype suit glitches, causing him to unwillingly change size. They escape before it gets worse.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter locating the lab, the trio finds it in the middle of a forest and breaks in. Ghost restrains Lang, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. She tells them about how her father, \nElihas Starr\n, accidentally killed himself and his wife during a quantum experiment that caused Starr's unstable state. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava after the accident, who they plan to cure using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet in the Quantum Realm, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manage to escape by staging a fake heart attack with Pym.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPym and Hope contact Janet with the tunnel fitted with the new part. She talks with them through Lang because of their quantum entanglement. She gives them a precise location to find her, but warns that they only have two hours to find her. At \nX-Con Security Consultants Office\n, Burch enters and uses a truth serum to get information from Luis then informs a \ncontact\n at the FBI. However, as they go to leave, Ghost enters having heard the location of Lang. Luis warns Lang, who then confesses to Hope and Pym, which angers them and prompts them to sever ties with him again. Lang is forced to rush home to save his house arrest. This leaves Pym and Hope to be arrested, and for their lab to be taken by Stoltz. However, he is found and killed by Ghost, who then takes the lab. Back at home, Lang is convinced by Cassie to rescue Hope and Pym despite the risks, promising that she'll love him no matter what happens.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody. They meet with Luis at the Pier and discuss a plan. They decide to have Pym dive into the quantum realm to get Janet. They will then shrink the lab and take it away from the enemy before they enlarge it in a secure location to get Janet and Pym home safe. They then wait for Ghost and Foster to activate the lab causing it to enlarge to where they can find the location. Lang and Hope distract Starr while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but end up fighting Burch and his men allowing Starr to begin the process of taking Janet's energy. A \ncar chase\n ensues across the streets of \nSan Francisco\n, ending at \nPier 39\n. Lang takes the lab and enlarges it, while Burch and his goons are apprehended.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPym finally \nencounters\n Janet in the Quantum Realm, and they arrive safely from the \nQuantum Tunnel\n. Ava attempts to sabotage their return, but when Lang and Hope intervene, she is stopped. Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to stabilize her condition. Lang returns home once again, in time for a suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. He then happily reunites with Cassie, while Hank restores the family home (which he had shrunk and was hiding) on the beach for him and Janet.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLang ventures into the Quantum Realm to collect particles to help heal Starr, while monitored by Pym, Janet, and Hope. Although he is successful in harvesting the particles, Hope's countdown to bring him back suddenly cuts out. It is revealed that, as a result of \nThanos's Snap\n, Pym, Janet, and Hope have all been turned to ash, leaving Lang trapped in the Quantum Realm. In a post-credits scene, \nan oversized ant\n plays the drum kit in Lang's house while the television is broadcasting a \nstate of emergency\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nPaul Rudd\n as \nScott Lang/Ant-Man\nEvangeline Lilly\n as \nHope van Dyne/Wasp\nMadeleine McGraw\n as Young \nHope van Dyne\nMichael Douglas\n as Doctor \nHank Pym\nDax Griffin\n as Young \nHank Pym\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n as \nJanet van Dyne\nHayley Lovitt\n as Young \nJanet van Dyne\nBobby Cannavale\n as \nJim Paxton\nMichael Pea\n as \nLuis\nLaurence Fishburne\n as Doctor \nBill Foster\nLangston Fishburne\n as Young \nBill Foster\nDavid Dastmalchian\n as \nKurt Goreshter\nT.I.\n as \nDave\nJudy Greer\n as \nMaggie Lang\nAbby Ryder Fortson\n as \nCassie Lang\nHannah John-Kamen\n as \nAva Starr/Ghost\nRaeLynn Bratten\n as Young \nAva Starr\nRandall Park\n as Agent \nJimmy Woo\nWalton Goggins\n as \nSonny Burch\nDivian Ladwa\n as \nUzman\nSean Thompson Kleier\n as Agent \nStoltz\nBenjamin Byron Davis\n as Agent \nBurleigh\nSuehyla El-Attar\n as Agent \nPearson\nGoran Kosti\n as \nAnitolov\nRob Archer\n as \nKnox\nMichael Cerveris\n as \nElihas Starr\nRiann Steele\n as \nCatherine Starr\nDarcy Shean\n as \nRose\nTim Heidecker\n as \nDaniel Gooobler\nAna Maria Quintana\n as Sister \nAna Maria\nJulia Vera-Andrews\n as \nLuis' Grandmother\nBryan Lugo\n as Officer \nScott\nStan Lee\n as \nShrunken Car Man\nJoshua Mikel\n as \nDerek\n \n(uncredited)\nUnknown Actor as \nHancock\n \n(uncredited)\nAppearances\n[\n]\nLocations\n[\n]\nEarth\nSan Francisco\n, \nCalifornia\nPym Residence\nScott Lang's House\nOui\nX-Con Security Consultants Office\nBrookemont Elementary School\nJim Paxton's House\nSan Francisco FBI Office\nPier 39\nKarapetyan Apartment\n \n(blueprints)\nPym Technologies Headquarters\n \n(mentioned)\nCalifornia\nGhost's Hideout\nMuir Woods\nSan Quentin State Prison\n \n(flashback)\nBerkeley\n, \nCalifornia\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nBuenos Aires\n, \nArgentina\n \n(flashback)\nGermany\n \n(mentioned)\nLeipzig-Halle Airport\n \n(mentioned)\nMinnesota\n \n(mentioned)\nMultiverse\nQuantum Realm\nSub-Atomica\nVoid\n \n(flashback)\nTime Vortex\n \n(mentioned)\nEvents\n[\n]\nBattle at the \nOui\nAmbush at Ghost's Hideout\nArrest of Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne\nChase for the Mobile Laboratory\nRescue of Janet van Dyne\nSnap\nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n \n(mentioned)\nHYDRA Uprising\n \n(mentioned)\nItems\n[\n]\nAnt-Man Suit\nWasp Suit\nWasp's Stingers\nPym Particles\nMobile Laboratory\nQuantum Tunnel\nGhost Suit\nQuantum Stabilizer\nQuantum Energy Chamber\nEMP Communication Device\nUzman's Truth Serum\nPym Particle Discs\nQuantum Realm Exploration Suit\nQuantum Energy Collector\nQuantum Healing Particles\nOnline Close-up Magic University\nAnkle Monitor\nThe Fault in Our Stars\nAnimal House\nThem!\nICBM\n \n(flashback)\nSokovia Accords\n \n(mentioned)\nGoliath Suit\n \n(indirectly mentioned)\nConcepts\n[\n]\nDreams\nMagic\n \n(mentioned)\nVehicles\n[\n]\nHot Wheels Car Collection\nHyundai Veloster\nLuis' Van\nQuantum Vehicle\nJeep\nSentient Species\n[\n]\nHumans\nGhosts\n \n(mentioned)\nCreatures\n[\n]\nAnts\nUlysses S.
