Because my \nAunt May\n taught me that everyone deserves a second chance.\"\nSpider-Man to \nGreen Goblin\n, \nSandman\n, \nElectro\n and \nLizard\n[src]\nPeter Benjamin Parker\n is a former \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n student who gained superhuman abilities and fought crime in \nNew York City\n as the superhero \nSpider-Man\n. While he juggled his hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was recruited by \nTony Stark\n to join the \nAvengers Civil War\n, putting Spider-Man into a \nbrief conflict\n with \nCaptain America\n. Parker was given a \nnew suit\n as well as new Stark technology in exchange for his help and was allowed to keep them when he returned home to continue his own hero work.\nWhile he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of \nIron Man\n so he could join the \nAvengers\n, Parker began investigating the illicit criminal activities of \nVulture\n, who was attempting to sell his \nChitauri\n based weapons onto the black market, with only the assistance of his best friend \nNed Leeds\n, while also trying to win his academic decathlon finals. Eventually, Parker gained the affections of classmate \nLiz Allan\n, but learned her father, \nAdrian Toomes\n, was Vulture. Spider-Man thwarted Vulture's \nrobbery\n of a \nStark Industries\n \ncargo plane\n, to which Stark showed his respect by offering Parker an official place with the Avengers. Parker turned this down in order to continue being a local hero in Queens, despite his \nAunt May\n discovering his secret identity.\nParker was pulled back into the Avengers' \nconflict\n when the \nBlack Order\n had \ninvaded\n \nEarth\n, joining Stark as a stowaway to \nrescue\n \nDoctor Strange\n from space. Given a new \nIron Spider\n \narmor\n, Parker, Stark and Strange joined forces with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, joining their attempts to prevent \nThanos\n from collecting the six \nInfinity Stones\n. But the heroes failed to defeat Thanos during the \nBattle of Titan\n; resulting in \nhalf of life being wiped out\n; including Parker. \nFive years later\n, Spider-Man was resurrected in the \nBlip\n, and rejoined the \nfight\n against \nThanos\n, ultimately watching Stark sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.\nThe bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties, while also being pressured by the press if he would be the next Iron Man, and seeking refuge on his school trip to \nEurope\n. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of \nMichelle Jones\n, Parker witnessed \nHydro-Man\n's attack in \nVenice\n and was recruited by \"\nNick Fury\n\" to work with \nMysterio\n to defeat the \nElementals\n. Dubbed \nNight Monkey\n after \ndefeating\n \nMolten Man\n in \nPrague\n, Parker bequeathed Stark's \nglasses\n to Mysterio, only to discover that Mysterio manipulated him in doing so to gain access to Stark's \nweaponized drones\n to stage more threats. Recruiting \nHappy Hogan\n's help, Spider-Man traveled to \nLondon\n and \ndefeated\n Mysterio, who died of a misfired gunshot on the \nTower Bridge\n.\nUpon Parker's return to New York, doctored footage was sent to \nThe Daily Bugle\n incriminating him as the mastermind of the drone attacks, as well as the murderer of Mysterio, while exposing his true identity to the world. While he was eventually cleared of all charges with \nMatt Murdock\n's help, the resulting controversy upended his and his friends' futures, leading Parker to enlist \nDoctor Strange\n to cast a \nmemory-altering spell\n, wishing to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more. However, Parker's repeated amendments mid-casting ruined the spell, resulting in a \nmultiversal\n rift that unleashed foes of Spider-Man from alternate universes. Although intending to cure them before sending them back to avert their ill-fated deaths in their native universes, \nGreen Goblin\n convinced the villains to \nbetray\n Parker, ultimately resulting in his aunt's death. Parker then met two \nalternate\n \nversions\n of himself who helped him overcome his grief and cure their enemies in a \nbattle\n on the \nStatue of Liberty\n. Faced with an impossible choice, Parker had Strange cast another spell to make their universe oblivious to his existence in order to protect the Multiverse from collapsing, erasing himself from his friends and allies' memories in his universe. Starting anew and believing himself to be dangerous to those around him, Parker decided to isolate himself from everyone, including his friends and allies, in order to keep them safe and resumed his duties undisturbed as an independent Spider-Man.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nGrowing Up in New York\n1.1.2\n \nBattle at Stark Expo\n1.1.3\n \nBecoming Spider-Man\n1.1.4\n \nInternet Sensation\n1.2\n \nAvengers Civil War\n1.2.1\n \nRecruited by Tony Stark\n1.2.2\n \nNew Spider-Suit\n1.2.3\n \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n1.2.4\n \nFighting Captain America\n1.2.5\n \nTaking Down Giant-Man\n1.2.6\n \nKeeping the Suit\n1.3\n \nBack to Daily Life\n1.3.1\n \nA Morning Rush\n1.3.2\n \nMidtown Science Student\n1.3.3\n \nHero Duty\n1.3.4\n \nStopping a Bank Robbery\n1.3.5\n \nFound by Ned Leeds\n1.3.6\n \nDinner with Aunt May\n1.3.7\n \nParty Invitation\n1.3.8\n \nLiz Allan's Party\n1.4\n \nConflict with Vulture\n1.4.1\n \nChase of Vulture's Crew\n1.4.2\n \nSaved by Iron Man\n1.4.3\n \nTracking Vulture\n1.4.4\n \nDecathlon Trip\n1.4.5\n \nDamage Control Truck Attack\n1.4.6\n \nTrapped in the Storage Vault\n1.4.7\n \nWashington Monument Rescue\n1.4.8\n \nBack to New York\n1.4.9\n \nStaten Island Ferry Incident\n1.5\n \nFinal Test\n1.5.1\n \nLosing His Suit\n1.5.2\n \nReturn to School\n1.5.3\n \nVulture's Secret\n1.5.4\n \nShocker's Ambush\n1.5.5\n \nConfronting Vulture\n1.5.6\n \nStopping the Stark Cargo Plane Hijacking\n1.5.7\n \nDuel at Coney Island\n1.6\n \nHero of New York\n1.6.1\n \nReturning to School\n1.6.2\n \nRejecting the Avengers\n1.7\n \nInfinity War\n1.7.1\n \nNew York Invasion\n1.7.2\n \nRescue of Doctor Strange\n1.7.3\n \nMeeting the Guardians\n1.7.4\n \nMaking a Plan\n1.7.5\n \nBattle of Titan\n1.7.6\n \nThanos' Victory\n1.7.7\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.7.8\n \nProtecting the Gauntlet\n1.7.9\n \nLosing Tony Stark\n1.8\n \nSummer Trip\n1.8.1\n \nDiscussing Travel Plans\n1.8.2\n \nRunning Several Errands\n1.8.3\n \nAttack on the Manfredi Crime Family\n1.8.4\n \nPressure from the Public\n1.8.5\n \nFlying to Europe\n1.8.6\n \nEncountering Hydro-Man\n1.8.7\n \nMeeting Nick Fury\n1.8.8\n \nAttacked on the Highway\n1.8.9\n \nLectured\n1.8.10\n \nNight at the Opera\n1.8.11\n \nFighting Molten Man\n1.8.12\n \nTalking with Mysterio\n1.8.13\n \nLearning Mysterio's Tricks\n1.9\n \nConflict with Mysterio\n1.9.1\n \nAmbushed by Mysterio\n1.9.2\n \nCreating a New Suit\n1.9.3\n \nBattle of London\n1.9.4\n \nDuel with Mysterio\n1.9.5\n \nLeaving Europe\n1.10\n \nIdentity Crisis\n1.10.1\n \nDate with MJ\n1.10.2\n \nPublic Enemy Number One\n1.10.3\n \nRepresented by Matt Murdock\n1.10.4\n \nInterviewed by Betty Brant\n1.10.5\n \nCondominium Relocation\n1.10.6\n \nCollege Admission Problems\n1.11\n \nMultiversal Crisis\n1.11.1\n \nSeeking Doctor Strange\n1.11.2\n \nTampering with the Spell\n1.11.3\n \nAppealing to MIT\n1.11.4\n \nBattle with Doctor Octopus\n1.11.5\n \nTracking Multiversal Trespassers\n1.11.6\n \nCapturing Sandman and Electro\n1.11.7\n \nMeeting Norman Osborn\n1.11.8\n \nScuffle with Doctor Strange\n1.11.9\n \nAttempting to Alter Fates\n1.12\n \nLosing Everything\n1.12.1\n \nChaos and Calamity\n1.12.2\n \nMeeting Other Spider-Men\n1.12.3\n \nMidtown Lab Project\n1.12.4\n \nBattle at Liberty Island\n1.12.5\n \nFighting Green Goblin\n1.12.6\n \nOne Way Home\n1.12.7\n \nMaking Sacrifices\n1.12.8\n \nNew Independence\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nFormer Powers\n3.3\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nWeapons\n4.2\n \nOther Equipment\n4.3\n \nFormer Equipment\n4.4\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nFacilities\n6\n \nRelationships\n6.1\n \nFamily\n6.2\n \nAllies\n6.3\n \nEnemies\n7\n \nAppearances\n8\n \nTrivia\n9\n \nBehind the Scenes\n10\n \nReferences\n11\n \nExternal Links\nBiography\n[\n]\nThis is an in-depth biography of Spider-Man.

Orphaned by his parents during childhood, leaving the young Parker to be raised by his loving aunt \nMay Parker\n and uncle \nBen Parker\n, the latter of whom died later in his life.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nBattle at Stark Expo\n[\n]\n\"Nice work, kid.\"\n\nIron Man\n to Peter Parker\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker bravely challenges a \nHammer Drone\n \n \nIn \n2010\n, Parker visited the \nStark Expo\n and acquired toy replicas of the Iron Man helmet and glove, as well as \nTony Stark\n's autograph. During his second visit, \nHammer Drones\n sent by \nIvan Vanko\n began \nattacking\n the expo, prompting Stark, the host, to fight them as Iron Man. One drone had landed in front of Parker, who held his hand up in defiance and aimed his toy repulsor at the suit. Iron Man arrived shortly thereafter and annihilated the drone, thanking Parker for his help before flying off to continue his battle, leaving Parker awestruck.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n11\n]\nBecoming Spider-Man\n[\n]\n\"Ever since I got bit by that spider, I've only had one week where my life has felt normal.\"\nPeter Parker to \nMichelle Jones\n[src]\nIn his teens, Parker attended \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n, where he quickly became best friends with his classmate \nNed Leeds\n, and the target of bullying from \nFlash Thompson\n. Parker also became acquainted with \nMichelle Jones\n, who often teased him, and developed a crush on \nLiz Allan\n, a popular student.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker becomes Spider-Man\n \n \nIn late \n2015\n, at the age of fourteen, Parker was bitten by a spider and acquired superhuman powers, including strength and speed proportional to that of a spider and an uncanny ability to adhere to walls.\n[\n4\n]\n Resolving to use his abilities to help those in need, Parker developed his own \nsynthetic web fluid\n and \nWeb-Shooters\n to use when battling criminals in \nNew York City\n as the masked superhero Spider-Man. To keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret, Parker maintained an unassuming lifestyle, refusing to join the football team or do anything he would not have done before.\n[\n2\n]\nInternet Sensation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man stops a car from hitting the bus\n \n \n\"That's all on \nYouTube\n though, right? I mean that's where you found it. 'Cause you know that's all fake. It's all done on a computer.\"\nPeter Parker to \nTony Stark\n[src]\nSince beginning his vigilante and amateur superhero career, Spider-Man had caught the attention of various news organizations and reporters.\n[\n16\n]\n Witnesses had filmed footage of his feats, such as subduing a thief and stopping a speeding car from hitting a bus,\n[\n17\n]\n and they have posted said footage to \nYouTube\n and other video hosting sites.\n[\n2\n]\n The video of Spider-Man catching the bus was also viewed on YouTube by \nTony Stark\n, who then managed to discern his identity and looked into his activities.\n[\n18\n]\nAvengers Civil War\n[\n]\nRecruited by Tony Stark\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker returns \nhome\n to find \nTony Stark\n \n \n\"So, you're the Spiderling? Crime-Fighting-Spider? Spider-Boy?\"\n\"...S-Spider-Man.\"\n\nTony Stark\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nOne day in \n2016\n, after Parker returned \nhome\n from \nschool\n, he greeted his \nAunt May\n and made mention of a \"crazy car\" parked outside their apartment building. The presence of \nTony Stark\n, his biggest idol, in the living room then caught Parker off-guard, leaving him speechless. Parker became confused when Stark told his aunt that \nStark Industries\n planned to give him a sizable \ngrant\n, claiming that Parker had signed up for it in the past, which he had not.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker watches online footage of himself\n \n \nDuring a private conversation in Parker's room, Stark showed him footage of Spider-Man apprehending criminals and stopping speeding cars with his bare hands. Stark jokingly wondered if that figure was not Parker, to which Parker awkwardly denied the figure's existence, instead simply claiming that all of the footage had been edited.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker explains the origins of Spider-Man\n \n \nParker kept claiming that the video was fake footage that was made on a computer, but his cover was blown when Stark uncovered the makeshift outfit that Parker used as his \ncostume\n hidden in a loft space. Parker had no other choice but to confess that he had been Spider-Man for six months. Stark ridiculed Parker for his cheap costume, but was impressed by, and complimented, the tensile strength of his web fluid and asked who had made it, to which Parker admitted that he had made it.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is recruited to join \nIron Man\n's team\n \n \nParker became defensive when Stark mocked the design of Parker's goggles from his costume, explaining that the goggles helped him focus his enhanced senses. When Stark wondered why he became Spider-Man, Parker, without going into detail, explained that he understood that he needed to stop bad things from happening. Stark invited him to come to \nGermany\n to confront \nCaptain America\n, but Parker claimed he had too much homework to go out and join the mission.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker webbing \nTony Stark\n to the doorknob\n \n \nIgnoring Parker, Stark said that the mission could be dangerous and decided to tell May that he was taking Parker out on a field trip. As Stark walked toward the door, Parker overreacted for a moment and had used his own \nWeb-Shooters\n to web Stark's hand next to the doorknob, ordering him not to tell May. Stark relented but after a brief silence, asked to be freed from his webbing. Embarrassed, Parker freed Stark's hand from the door awkwardly so he could leave as they then went to Germany.\n[\n2\n]\nNew Spider-Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker films a video diary for his sudden trip\n \n \n\"What the? This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\"Let's go!\"\n\"Yeah, well, I, I don't understand, is this for me? Happy? Happy, wait! This is... insane! Insane! Look at this thing, look at the eyes! It's like... it's like a skin-tight \nIron Man\n suit.\"\nPeter Parker and \nHappy Hogan\n[src]\nParker was then escorted by \nHappy Hogan\n onboard \nStark Industries Private Jet\n bound for Germany. While Hogan was driving him, Parker made a video throughout his trip which Hogan reminded him that he could not show it to anyone. When Parker tried to make conversation with Hogan by asking why people often called him Happy, he was ignored for the rest of the trip to the airport by the highly irritated Hogan.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker films his trip with \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nWhen Parker arrived on the jet, he was amazed by all the cool features on board, such as its need for no pilots as well as the fact that there were bathrooms located on board the jet itself. When Parker sat down, Hogan was confused by all Parker's awkwardness, as he had never been on a plane before as he chose to sit down just across from him, noting he had never left \nNew York City\n before. While Hogan slept on the jet, Parker videoed him, waking him up in shock.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker finally arrives in \nBerlin\n for his mission\n \n \nWhen they arrived in \nBerlin\n, Parker explored the country video-logging everything without actually knowing why he was there in the first place, Parker was simply told that \nCaptain America\n had now apparently gone crazy which was the reason why \nIron Man\n had requested his help. When they arrived at the hotel, Hogan directed Parker to his room which was right next door to Hogan's own room, but to the delight of Parker and the irritation of Hogan.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man prepares to go on the mission\n \n \nHaving then been told to suit up to go onto the \nmission\n in just a few minutes, Parker then prepared for his upcoming fight with all of the rogue \nAvengers\n and put on his \noriginal suit\n and warmed himself up by filming himself in the mirror. Hogan soon walked in on Parker and, bewildered, asked Parker why he was not wearing the suit that \nTony Stark\n made him, only for Parker to question what Hogan meant as he had not yet found anything from Stark in the hotel for him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker amazed by his new \nSpider-Man Suit\n \n \nParker, who was unaware of such a suit, then located the suitcase in another part of his hotel room and opened it, revealing the new suit and its features and upgrades which had been designed for him by Stark. Parker, speechless, put on the suit and joined Hogan who took him to \nLeipzig-Halle Airport\n, with Hogan showing no patience for Parker's excitement for the new upgraded Spider-Man Suit as Parker continued filming his reaction.\n[\n4\n]\nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man prepares to join in the fight\n \n \n\"Nice job, kid.\"\n\"Thanks! Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better, it's just this \nnew suit\n... it's nothing. Mr. Stark, it's perfect, thank you.\"\n\"Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.\"\n\nIron Man\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nWhile waiting for his cue from \nIron Man\n to join the fight, Spider-Man secretly filmed and shortly narrated the standoff from some distance away, excitedly capturing Iron Man along with other members of the \nAvengers\n. While he was wondering who \nBlack Panther\n was as he was currently standing alongside the Avengers, Iron Man then gave Spider-Man the cue to come out, much to his great excitement.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man steals \nCaptain America\n's \nShield\n \n \nSpider-Man quickly put down his phone\n[\n4\n]\n and swung to the standoff, thereby stripping \nCaptain America\n of his \nshield\n with his \nwebbing\n while also binding Rogers' hands together. Spider-Man then gracefully landed on a tug, casually greeting everyone. He then quickly became distracted at the sight of the Avengers, who he idolized, much to Iron Man's annoyance since he told Spider-Man to stop talking and instead focus onto their mission. After saluting Captain America, Spider-Man looked on as Iron Man and Captain America continued to argue about the \nSokovia Accords\n, keeping the shield so Captain America was at a disadvantage.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man asking what he should do next\n \n \nHowever, Spider-Man was surprised by \nAnt-Man\n, who had managed to sneak onto the shield and kick him in order to return it to Captain America. As the Avengers began to fight each other, Spider-Man asked Iron Man what he was supposed to do. Iron Man had told Spider-Man to keep his distance and use his \nWeb-Shooters\n against Captain America and his companions, as he did not want to hurt any of them or Spider-Man himself during the fight against the Avengers.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man battles against \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nSpider-Man then followed \nFalcon\n and \nBucky Barnes\n in the airport terminal building by ascending onto and crawling along the outside windows, much to the great confusion of both. Spider-Man had then proceeded to smash his way through the glass and knocked Falcon to the ground with a hard kick, turning upon Barnes to stop his punch, though he became fascinated by his \nmetal arm\n, calling it awesome, as Barnes was confused by the statement.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man scraps against \nFalcon\n in the air\n \n \nThis momentary distraction allowed Falcon to tackle him and fly into the air while Spider-Man wrestled him, trying to insist that he would take Falcon into custody somehow as they continued to wrestle in mid-air. While Spider-Man swung through the airport terminal in pursuit of Falcon, he \nsensed\n Barnes had just thrown something at him, allowing Spider-Man to barely dodge out of the way before then throwing it back towards Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man traps \nFalcon\n with his webbing\n \n \nDuring a battle against Falcon, Spider-Man managed to use his webbing to damage the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, causing Falcon to crash land before Spider-Man then webbed him up to some hand railings in the terminal building, but became distracted, this time by his wingsuit, as Spider-Man began wondering if they were made from carbon fiber as he had rambled about the sophistication of the harness, much to Falcon's irritation as he noted he should not talk as much.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man beats \nBucky Barnes\n and \nFalcon\n \n \nAs Barnes tried to intervene, Spider-Man was able to trap him and Falcon in his webbing, knocking them both onto the ground floor below, taking them out of the fight for the time being. As he began to apologize for their fight, Spider-Man was caught off-guard and was snatched away by \nRedwing\n, which grappled his leg and flew through a window, dropping him outside while Falcon and Barnes had then escaped the webbing while Spider-Man was gone.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man runs into battle with his allies\n \n \nUnfazed by his defeat, Spider-Man rejoined his teammates as they lined up against \nCaptain America\n's own team in a brief standoff, with \nVision\n trying to divide the pair with a powerful beam which was fired from the \nMind Stone\n. When the two teams began charging straight towards each other, Spider-Man had initially thought that Captain America's team would back down, but \nIron Man\n noted that they would not back down from a fight either as they all began running.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swinging across the battlefield\n \n \nAs he charged into battle with the rest of his team, Spider-Man briefly fought with \nWanda Maximoff\n as he fired his \nWeb-Shooters\n at her while dodging the cars she threw back in return and evading \nHawkeye\n's various \ntrick arrows\n before Hawkeye had then ignored Spider-Man in order to fight against the \nBlack Widow\n. Spider-Man then just swung across the airport dodging whatever Maximoff threw at him in an attempt to assist Iron Man's fight against the opposing team.\n[\n2\n]\nFighting Captain America\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man confronting \nCaptain America\n \n \n\"Look, kid, there's a lot going on here that you don't understand.\"\n\"Mr. \nStark\n said you'd say that.\"\n\nCaptain America\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nAs Spider-Man swung across the airport, he witnessed \nWanda Maximoff\n saving \nBucky Barnes\n from \nBlack Panther\n before his \nwebbing\n was cut as \nCaptain America\n brought Spider-Man to the ground by throwing his \nshield\n at Spider-Man's webbing. The pair expressed their respect to each other while Captain America also asked what \nIron Man\n had said about him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man battling \nCaptain America\n alone\n \n \nSpider-Man explained to Captain America that Iron Man had believed Captain America was wrong about his views on the \nSokovia Accords\n and that made him dangerous. Spider-Man also explained that Iron Man had advised him to aim for his legs, which he did, using his \nWeb-Shooters\n to trip Captain America and drag him across the ground before kicking him. Spider-Man attempted to subdue Captain America by webbing his arms and pulling him back, struggling against Captain America's strength.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is defeated by \nCaptain America\n \n \nWith Captain America then quickly able to flip away from Spider-Man's grasp and threw Spider-Man away, Spider-Man still continued to try and subdue Captain America with webs. Eventually, Captain America was able to yank on one of the webs and threw Spider-Man towards him before hitting him hard across the face with his shield, forcing Spider-Man to retreat by leaping back, while Captain America continued asking what Iron Man had told Spider-Man about him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempts to hold up a platform\n \n \nSeeking to end the fight, Captain America used his shield to damage the support beams of a platform, which fell and forced Spider-Man to hold it up. Captain America found Spider-Man's strength impressive and his heart genuine. As Captain America retrieved his shield and prepared to rejoin the battle, he asked Spider-Man where he was from, as Spider-Man then told he was from Queens, while Captain America was from Brooklyn before he had left the beleaguered hero behind.\n[\n2\n]\nTaking Down Giant-Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man vlogging while the fight occurs\n \n \n\"Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, \"\nEmpire Strikes Back\n\"?\"\nSpider-Man to \nWar Machine\n and \nIron Man\n[src]\nOnce he concluded fighting against \nCaptain America\n, Spider-Man once again picked up his phone and described what was transpiring during his scuffle, explaining how he had stolen Captain America's \nshield\n during their skirmish. However, while he was narrating to the camera, Spider-Man witnessed \nAnt-Man\n transforming himself into his giant form before grabbing hold of \nWar Machine\n's leg in mid-air which briefly stopped the battle. Spider-Man shouted an expletive at the sheer disbelief of the sight he was beholden to.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to save \nWar Machine\n \n \nRealizing that he had to go and help his team fight against Giant-Man, Spider-Man placed his phone on the ground,\n[\n4\n]\n and cursed in amazement at the sight of Giant-Man towering above them all. When \nWar Machine\n was thrown across the airport by Giant-Man, he was about to smash into an aircraft parked just outside, but Spider-Man saved him by firing his own \nSynthetic Webbing\n at War Machine and then pulling him away from the aircraft and swinging him back.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man getting a lift with \nWar Machine\n \n \nWhile Captain America and \nBucky Barnes\n used the distraction to attempt to escape by stealing their \nQuinjet\n from the nearby hanger, Spider-Man continued to fight against Giant-Man with the help of War Machine and \nVision\n, unaware that this all was actually merely a distraction. While Spider-Man had then attached himself onto War Machine's \narmor\n with his webbing, he swung up and stuck his web to Giant-Man's arm, while using the momentum to kick him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man climbs on \nGiant-Man\n's face\n \n \nSpider-Man then climbed onto Giant-Man's face and attempted to distract him by pressing himself against his goggles but was forced to retreat when Giant-Man threw him off from his own face with his own gargantuan hand. Towards the end of their battle, Spider-Man was inspired by the movie \nThe Empire Strikes Back\n and had come up with a strategy to defeat Giant-Man, although War Machine was also briefly mortified by realizing how young Spider-Man was.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to defeat \nGiant-Man\n \n \nSpider-Man then proceeded to use his Web-Shooters and webbed up Giant-Man's knees so that he then lost his balance, and then let War Machine and \nIron Man\n both fly up at full speed and strike him against the helmet with full power. As a result, Giant-Man fell over, hitting the now overly excited Spider-Man on the way down, making him fly into a pile of wooden boxes; knocking him unconscious for a short while on the battlefield as the fight continued elsewhere.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man finally collapses after the fight\n \n \nAfter the battle, Iron Man had told the exhausted Spider-Man, whose mask had come out of his face, that he was done and should now go home, threatening to call \nMay Parker\n if he did not. Feeling like he had disappointed Iron Man, Spider-Man desperately tried to convince him that he could still keep fighting, but soon reluctantly agreed while Iron Man flew off to chase Captain America, and admitted he was indeed done as he lay down utterly exhausted from the fight on the floor.\n[\n2\n]\nKeeping the Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker detailing the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n \n \n\"So when's our next... When's our next \"retreat,\" you know?\"\n\"What, next mission?\"\n\"Yeah, the mission. The missions.\"\n\"We'll call you.\"\nPeter Parker and \nTony Stark\n[src]\nOnce he was back in his hotel room, Parker filmed himself describing in excitement what had happened during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, noting how \nIron Man\n had called him into the battle and he had stolen \nCaptain America's Shield\n before getting involved in the conflict. Before going on, he was interrupted by the arrival of \nHappy Hogan\n, who knocked on the door and informed him that he could hear him through the thin walls.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man celebrates with all of his fans\n \n \nUnable to go to sleep, Parker then wore the \nSpider-Man Suit\n and left his hotel room via the window, and using all the rooftops, he quickly traversed all through \nBerlin\n until he got to a nightclub. Spider-Man, vlogging the entire experience, took pictures with the partygoers and used his \nWeb-Shooters\n to swing around with female guests, taking every chance to celebrate the incredible experience. Spider-Man had continued partying before quietly returning to the hotel.\n[\n19\n]\n Parker also purchased and watched an adult video through the hotel's pay-per-view that night.\n[\n3\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is confronted again by \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nThe next morning, Parker got breakfast and enjoying being flirted with by a waitress when Hogan questioned if he had been out as Spider-Man. The unimpressed Hogan thrust a German newspaper in his face, which featured the photo of Spider-Man saving the Berlin chancellor, with the German media dubbing him as \"Der Erstaunliche Klebrige Junge.\"\n[\n19\n]\n Returning home from \nGermany\n, Parker and \nTony Stark\n were driven by Hogan to his \napartment\n in \nNew York City\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker learning that he can keep the \nSuit\n \n \nParker filmed Stark explaining to \nAunt May\n that Parker had done an impressive job at the internship for \nStark Industries\n, although Stark still could not resist making suggestive remarks about May while they were still filming. When they arrived home, Stark told Parker that he could keep the \nSpider-Man Suit\n, with Hogan keeping an eye on him. Parker returned home after Stark had given him some advice on how he should operate as Spider-Man for the foreseeable future.\n[\n4\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker lies to \nAunt May\n about the fight\n \n \nParker returned home, resting in his bedroom as May gave him an ice bag for his black eye, which he had gained when \nCaptain America\n had struck him hard across the face with \nhis shield\n during the battle. When May asked Parker who had injured him, he told her about a Brooklyn man named \"Steve\" and his \nhuge friend\n. May then jokingly asked how he had done during the \nfight\n, hoping he had stood up for himself and Parker assured his aunt he got a few punches in himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker discovering his new \nSpider-Signal\n \n \nWhen May had exited the room to leave him alone, Parker continued to inspect his new \nWeb-Shooters\n designed by \nStark Industries\n. When Parker accidentally pressed a button hidden underneath the devices, a bright red beam suddenly emitted from the Web-Shooter on his right wrist, projecting the \nSpider-Signal\n onto the ceiling  much to Parker's surprise and delight as he considered what his own future as Spider-Man would hold with Stark's backing behind him.\n[\n2\n]\nBack to Daily Life\n[\n]\nA Morning Rush\n[\n]\nOne night, Parker sneaked out of his apartment to do some work as Spider-Man. However, he was unable to find any crimes and ended up falling asleep on a roof. In the morning, he woke up to the sound of sirens and looked to see what was happening.\n[\n20\n]\n Suddenly, a crow came out of nowhere and grabbed his mask off of his head. Parker tried to fight back, but the crow flew away. Parker looked around and found a clothesline, taking a shirt off of the wire to wear as a mask. He then pursued the \nEnforcers\n and got them arrested before returning to his apartment just in time for breakfast.\n[\n21\n]\nMidtown Science Student\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker attempts to contact \nHappy Hogan\n \n \n\"Did \nLiz\n get a new top?\"\n\"No. We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.\"\n\"We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nTwo months later, Parker continued his daily life as a high school student at the \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n. He continued to try to get back into contact with \nHappy Hogan\n in order to arrange another mission with the \nAvengers\n to prove his worth, only to find Hogan would not reply to his messages.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker arrives back at \nMidtown High\n \n \nArriving at Midtown once he had taken the train across from \nNew York City\n, Parker accidentally got in the way of \nFlash Thompson\n, who was driving his father's expensive sports car; Thompson immediately mocked him and called him \"Penis Parker\" as a way of greeting, which Parker ignored. Parker then walked into school through a sea of other students and made his way to his locker, where he put away his jacket and prepared for another day in his education.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n walk through school\n \n \nBefore classes began, Parker met with his best friend \nNed Leeds\n, who invited Parker to build his new \nLego Death Star\n. While highly excited, Parker claimed he could not join Leeds tonight as he instead had his internship at \nStark Industries\n. When Leeds was somewhat disappointed, Parker expressed his hope it could lead to a real job with \nTony Stark\n. Parker then became distracted by \nLiz Allan\n walking by as Leeds suggested he would come over later that night to work on the Death Star after making some headway on it.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker answers \nMonica Warren\n's question\n \n \nDuring physics class, Parker watched clips of himself as the Spider-Man performing various heroic deeds to try and get a sense of the public's perception of him. However, \nMonica Warren\n noticed he was not paying attention and since Thompson had just failed to answer her question of determining linear acceleration on a pendulum swing between two points, she invited Parker to try. Parker took one look at the board and solved the problem, innately familiar with its concept due to his web-slinging. Warren complimented him, to which Thompson tried intimidating Parker.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker returns to his normal school life\n \n \nAs he kept a close watch on the clock throughout the day, Parker then went to \nCobbwell\n's lab, in which he was being taught \nNeils Bohr\n's discoveries regarding quantum theory. Parker had finished his lab early, so he instead focused on upgrading his web fluid for his \nWeb-Shooters\n. Parker secretly mixed the chemicals together in a beaker hidden in his class drawer to create the fluid but discovered that it was forming much too fast and soon began to overflow over the beaker. Parker simply shut his drawer and continued listening to Cobbwell's lesson, while still keeping an eye on the clock to keep track of how long until he could leave school and be Spider-Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n admiring \nLiz Allan\n \n \nOver their lunch break, Parker and Leeds continued admiring Allan from afar in the cafeteria, watching her as she put up a banner for the upcoming homecoming dance. As they discussed what top Allan was wearing and if it was new or not, \nMichelle Jones\n interrupted and stated they were both creepy losers. Parker was confused and Leeds tried to turn the insult back on Jones, who calmly noted that she did not have any friends and therefore did not care about what they said.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker chooses to quit the decathlon team\n \n \nBelieving that Spider-Man would soon be recruited as an Avenger, Parker quit marching band and robotics lab to ensure his availability. He then told \nRoger Harrington\n that he would be unavailable for their school's academic decathlon team's Nationals in favor of his heroic activities which he covered up by saying it was for the Stark Internship. As Thompson questioned if Parker had ever even met \nTony Stark\n in person, the rest of their team, particularly Allan and \nCindy Moon\n, expressed their shock that Parker would be quitting right before Nationals.\n[\n4\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker defends quitting the decathlon team\n \n \nAfter practice while eating with his teammates, Parker was forced to defend his sudden decision to quit the decathlon team as Allan noted how little time there was before they went to \nWashington, D.C.\n for Nationals and Parker was their best player in physics. Although Parker tried to argue that they had Thompson to replace him, \nAbe Brown\n noted that everyone on the team preferred Parker. Parker then insisted that the decathlon would not do a physics challenge two years in a row.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is confronted alone by \nLiz Allan\n \n \nAs some decathlon members threw food at him out of annoyance for him quitting, Parker continued apologizing as he left the table. Allan followed him down the hallway, assuring Parker that she understood the struggle of trying to juggle everything in his life, but suggested he could still come experience Washington with their team, who were counting on him. Parker continued to insist that he simply did not have the time, leaving Allan disappointed.\n[\n19\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker finally is allowed to leave the \nschool\n \n \nHaving sat through several more classes within the Midtown Science School and became increasingly impatient to get outside, finally, the bell rang at quarter to three and Parker was able to leave. Charging out the front doors, Parker took a brief look around to ensure that nobody else could see him before using his Spider-Man powers to leap several feet above the school fence before making his way back into \nNew York City\n to begin his next adventure as Spider-Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker buying his sandwich from \nDelmar\n \n \nParker first stopped at \nDelmar's Deli-Grocery\n, where he greeted \nDelmar\n and bought himself a sandwich and gummy worms as an after-school snack. Delmar asked after Parker's \naunt\n before saying in Spanish that May was a beautiful woman. Parker retorted in Spanish by asking after Delmar's own daughter. Delmar threatened to overcharge him for the sandwich, but Parker apologized, convincing him to sell for the original price. Parker then greeted \nMurph\n and paid for the sandwich.\n[\n4\n]\nHero Duty\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker puts the \nSpider-Man Suit\n back on\n \n \n\"Hey, Happy, here's my report for tonight, I stopped a grand theft bicycle, Couldn't find the owner, so I just left a note. I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. I just feel like I could be doing more.\"\nPeter Parker to \nHappy Hogan\n[src]\nThus, every day after at \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n, Parker made his way into the outskirts of \nNew York City\n where he would soon find an empty alleyway to hide his school bag and don the \nSpider-Man Suit\n. Seeking to prove himself as a hero, Spider-Man would then patrol the city and continue his crime-fighting in New York, searching for anybody who may need his assistance.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man stops a bike thief with his webs\n \n \nAs he swung across the city looking for trouble going on, Spider-Man soon came across a bicycle thief charging down the sidewalk in an attempt to get away. So, Spider-Man leaped into action and blocked the thief's path before then using his \nWeb-Shooters\n to send the thief flying up to be arrested by the \nNew York City Police Department\n, all while Spider-Man then took possession of the bicycle, awkwardly searching for its owner who was nowhere to be found. As he could not find the owner, Spider-Man left a note signed by the \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man giving an old lady directions\n \n \nAs his search for people to aid with his super-powers proved more challenging than he expected as he struggled to find some legitimate crimes going on which he could stop, Spider-Man ended up using his time on the streets to perform minor acts of kindness, including helping to guide an old woman through New York City when she had gotten lost, being rewarded with a churro for his efforts in helping her, which Spider-Man gratefully took and later ate and enjoyed.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempts to capture a carjacker\n \n \nNot all heroics were successful, in one instance he webbed a man trying to get into his car, which he had mistaken for him attempting to steal the car. This resulted in the man's car alarm being set off while he demanded to be free of the webbing. This, in turn, landed Spider-Man in a lot of trouble among the neighbors, with \nthe man\n yelling out while \nMarjorie\n also yelled out from her own window as Spider-Man awkwardly attempted to resolve the matter peacefully.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man gives \nHappy Hogan\n an update\n \n \nDesperate for something more exciting and meaningful, Parker kept trying to call and text \nTony Stark\n through \nHappy Hogan\n but was continuously ignored by him. While taking a break from his attempts at heroics, Parker left a message on Hogan's voicemail in which he explained how he had stopped the bike thief and helped the old lady, hoping this would help get him into the \nAvengers\n so he could be a real hero at last and be able to make a real difference.\n[\n4\n]\nStopping a Bank Robbery\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man arrogantly interrupts a \nrobbery\n \n \n\"What's up, guys? Forgot your PIN number? Whoa! You're the \nAvengers\n! What are you guys doing here? \nThor\n, \nHulk\n  nice to finally meet you guys. Thought you'd be more handsome in person. \nIron Man\n! What are you doing robbing a \nbank\n? You're a billionaire.\"\nSpider-Man to \nCriminal Avengers\n[src]\nLater that night, Spider-Man spotted a small \ngroup of thieves\n attempting to \nrob an ATM\n. Building up confidence, preparing a posture, and determined to prove himself as a hero, Spider-Man went to confront them. Getting their attention, Spider-Man mocked the group for having disguised themselves with cheap \nAvengers\n masks, questioning why \nTony Stark\n would be robbing a bank, as the robbers attacked him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fights against all of the \nrobbers\n \n \nSpider-Man then fought the whole gang off effortlessly, continuing to mock them as if they were the real Avengers. During the fight, Spider-Man blocked a punch from the robber dressed as \nThor\n and threw him into the robber dressed as \nHulk\n. Using his enhanced abilities as well as his own \nWeb-Shooters\n, Spider-Man soon subdued almost all of the robbers, becoming more confident as the fight went on with Spider-Man easily dominating the entire skirmish.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is shot by an \nAnti-Gravity Gun\n \n \nHowever, one of the thugs used a highly advanced \nAnti-Gravity Gun\n made from \nChitauri\n technology to even the odds, knocking back Spider-Man. The fight resulted in one of the weapons accidentally destroying one of the nearby shops where \nDelmar\n was working. Spider-Man managed to capture the thieves and rescue Delmar and his cat before allowing the \nNew York City Police Department\n and the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n to come in and deal with the robbers.\n[\n4\n]\nFound by Ned Leeds\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sneaking back inside his bedroom\n \n \n\"Oh, \nshe\n doesn't know?\"\n\"Nobody knows! Well, I mean \nMr. Stark\n knows because he made my \nsuit\n but that's it!\"\n\"\nTony Stark\n made you that?! Are you an \nAvenger\n?\"\n\"...Yeah, basically.\"\n\nNed Leeds\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nSpider-Man returned to the \nParker Residence\n, slowly opening the window into his bedroom and crawled on the ceiling, stealthily moving through once closing the window after making sure \nAunt May\n wouldn't notice him. Taking special care not to make any noise as he arrived, before using his \nWeb-Shooters\n to quietly close the door so that he could then change into his normal clothes once again.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker's secret is discovered by \nNed Leeds\n \n \nHowever, just as Spider-Man relaxed and turned back towards his bed, he discovered that \nNed Leeds\n was inside his room all along and had just witnessed Parker crawling across the ceiling while wearing his \nSpider-Man Suit\n. Amazed by what he had just witnessed, Leeds then dropped his \nDeath Star Lego Set\n onto the floor while Parker desperately attempted to insist that he was not the Spider-Man, although Leeds had clearly figured it all out already.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker keeping \nAunt May\n from finding out\n \n \nAfter Parker took off the suit and realized he had accidentally invited Leeds over to finish the Lego Death Star, they were interrupted by May. She informed Parker that they would be eating out tonight as her turkey meatloaf had failed to cook properly. May invited Leeds to join them for Thai food, but Parker claimed that he had another engagement. May then recommended that Parker put on some clothes before they leave. When Leeds questioned if May knew the truth, Parker revealed that nobody but \nTony Stark\n knew.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nNed Leeds\n to keep his secret\n \n \nWhen Parker revealed that Stark had made the suit for him, Leeds excitedly wondered if he was a member of the \nAvengers\n, to which Parker awkwardly claimed that he \"basically\" was. Following some more arguing, Parker managed to convince Leeds to keep his Spider-Man activities a secret from May, not wanting to cause any more distress for his aunt after the death of \nhis uncle\n, which Leeds reluctantly agreed to. As Leeds left, he tried to ask Parker more questions about being Spider-Man, which an overwhelmed Parker promised to answer tomorrow at school.\n[\n4\n]\nDinner with Aunt May\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker goes out for dinner with \nAunt May\n \n \n\"If you spot something like \nthat\n happening, you turn and you run the other way.\"\n\"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.\"\n\nMay Parker\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nTogether, Parker and \nAunt May\n went to \nPrachya Thai\n. As Parker pondered over recent events, May then questioned him over why he was so distracted and barely touching his food, as larb was his favorite. Parker excused that the internship at \nStark Industries\n was stressing him out. Just then, he noticed a \nNY1\n news broadcast reporting Spider-Man's fight at the \nRobbery of the Queens Community Bank\n and the destruction of \nDelmar's Deli-Grocery\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks for a new backpack\n \n \nParker's attention was brought back to May when she recommended that he never get involved with anything like that, which Parker quickly promised not to. Parker then changed the subject by revealing that he lost his fifth backpack and needed a replacement. They were interrupted by a \nThai Waiter\n, who offered May dessert on the house, prompting Parker to tease his aunt over the man having a crush on her.\n[\n4\n]\nParty Invitation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker explaining his origins to \nNed Leeds\n \n \n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Helping you out, did you not hear her? \nLiz\n has a crush on you.\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nParker tried to resume his daily life with his friend aware of his heroic activities. On the way to \nSchool\n, Parker explained to \nNed Leeds\n how he gained his powers from being bitten by the spider, noting that the spider was now dead. On route, they came across the aftermath of the \nRobbery of the Queens Community Bank\n, as Parker noted the arrival of the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n and \nAnne Marie Hoag\n before they continued towards school.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is bombarded with more questions\n \n \nWhile they sat in their classes, including science and one lecture on the origins of the \nSokovia Accords\n, Leeds continued pestering Parker with questions regarding his abilities as Spider-Man; such as how he gained his powers as well as other trivial matters which soon began to annoy Parker. As the questions continued, Parker ignored most of the questions as Leeds asked if he laid eggs, how far he could fire his \nWeb-Shooters\n and if he could summon an army of spiders.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker admits to knowing \nCaptain America\n \n \nAs they prepared for Coach \nAndre Wilson\n's gym class, they were shown a video of \nCaptain America's Fitness Challenge\n, as Leeds questioned if Parker had ever met \nCaptain America\n in person while going out on his missions as Spider-Man. Somewhat pleased with himself and willing to brag for a moment, Parker revealed to Leeds that he had managed to successfully steal \nCaptain America's Shield\n during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, much to Leeds' complete amazement.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker practices training with \nNed Leeds\n \n \nWhen they were continuing their training in the school's gym, doing Captain America's Fitness challenge, Leeds still would not stop and questioned if the \nAvengers\n had to pay taxes and what \nHulk\n actually smelled like and if \nSteve Rogers\n was cool or like a mean grandpa, until Parker told him to shut up. Leeds still did not stop and instead asked if he could be Parker's man in the chair giving him assistance during missions, much to Parker's considerable annoyance.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is revealed to know the Spider-Man\n \n \nParker and Leeds then overheard \nLiz Allan\n talking with her friends \nBetty Brant\n, \nCharles Murphy\n, and \nSeymour O'Reilly\n, during which Allan confessed to harboring a crush on Spider-Man while discussing the \nAvengers\n. As Leeds then suddenly announced that Parker was friends with Spider-Man and that he would be at Allan's party, annoying Parker. Having endured mockery from \nFlash Thompson\n, Leeds had then convinced Parker this was a good chance to get involved with Allan.\n[\n4\n]\nLiz Allan's Party\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and Leeds say goodbye to \nAunt May\n \n \n\"No, no, no. I can't, I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I'm just gonna be myself.\"\n\"Peter, no one wants that.\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nLater that same evening, \nAunt May\n drove the pair up to the \nToomes Residence\n, noting her own love for house parties. While outside the house, May complimented \nNed Leeds\n on his hat while Parker became nervous and suggested going home, only for May to tease him by questioning if he was going through puberty and felt apprehensive about his own body's changes until Parker had finally relented and he and Leeds went into the party, much to Leeds' great delight.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is personally greeted by \nLiz Allan\n \n \nAs they arrived, Parker revealed to Leeds that he was indeed wearing the \nSpider-Man Suit\n beneath his clothing, much to Leeds excitement. Entering the house, they saw that \nFlash Thompson\n was acting as the DJ for the party while \nMichelle Jones\n teased them for coming to the party while denying that she was also attending the party. They were soon greeted by \nLiz Allan\n, who had expressed her happiness that Parker had come while Parker complimented her on her party.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is rudely mocked by \nFlash Thompson\n \n \nWhile Leeds insisted that he needed to dress up and be Spider-Man to impress everybody there, Parker refused and was adamant to be himself, despite Leeds insisting that this would impress nobody. However, after another taunt from Thompson, who mocked Parker for failing to arrive with Spider-Man while still calling him Penis Parker while the crowds laughed, Parker excused himself and donned his costume outside on the Toomes Residence's roof in private.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker considers impressing \nLiz Allan\n \n \nHaving put on the \nSpider-Man Suit\n, Parker began practicing how he would arrive at the party and impress everybody, although he began to get cold feet. While on the roof, Parker then spotted a \nlarge blue explosion\n far off in the distance. Wishing to investigate, Spider-Man donned his mask and swung off the roof, only to quickly find himself in the middle of the park with nothing for his \nWeb-Shooters\n to attach onto, forcing Spider-Man to simply run towards the explosion.\n[\n4\n]\nConflict with Vulture\n[\n]\nChase of Vulture's Crew\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man spies on an illegal deal\n \n \n\"Hey, hey! If you're gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me!\"\n\"...A'ight.\"\nSpider-Man and \nHerman Schultz\n[src]\nBefore long, Spider-Man found \nJackson Brice\n as he was trying to sell weapons on the black market, some of which Spider-Man deduced were the same as from the \nRobbery of the Queens Community Bank\n the other day, with Brice demonstrating the \nUltron Blaster Gun\n. As Spider-Man watched, \nAaron Davis\n, the buyer explained that he was not interested in such dangerous weapons and still preferred a simple gun to use.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nJackson Brice\n \n \nWhile Brice was attempting to show off his \nBlack Hole Grenade\n set and other equipment for Davis to possibly buy, their deal was suddenly interrupted when they heard a call ringtone as \nNed Leeds\n' had called Spider-Man about his whereabouts as he was expecting him back at \nLiz Allan\n's party to impress the guests. This made the two criminals instantly believe that Davis had set them up and aimed their guns at him. Intent on saving Davis, Spider-Man then intervened and told the two thugs to shoot him instead of Davis. \nHerman Schultz\n happily obliged before Brice put on \nShocker's Gauntlet\n and punched Spider-Man with some considerable force before they attempted to make their escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is dragged across the streets\n \n \nA chase then ensued as Spider-Man used his \nWeb-Shooters\n to web onto the thug's van and was dragged along as they tried to make their escape, causing damage throughout the neighborhood. While Spider-Man was dragged through the streets, Brice then used his weapons within the truck to continue firing at Spider-Man, managing to also damage his own truck during their clash. Eventually, Spider-Man was driven into a brick post and lost his grip on the truck.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man runs into neighborhood homes\n \n \nFinally managing to shake him off the van, Brice and Schultz attempt to make their escape while Spider-Man was left to chase and search for them yet again. Running through the outskirts of \nNew York City\n, Spider-Man struggled to use his Web-Shooters as he ran through residential housing, encountering local people while bringing down a treehouse and crashing through a garden shed. Spider-Man landed by a girl's tent, as the girls then loudly screamed.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man being ambushed by \nVulture\n \n \nSpider-Man continued to keep track of the van, causing considerably more disturbance throughout the neighborhood in his pursuit. Before long, he managed to find the criminal's van. Just as he was about to jump onto their van, \nVulture\n appeared and grabbed him from behind, using his \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n to violently pull Spider-Man into the sky. Spider-Man struggled to get off this new adversary's grip as Vulture continued bringing him higher up into the sky.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man's life is just saved by \nIron Man\n \n \nDuring their struggle when Vulture reached high enough, the \nSpider-Man Suit\n's emergency parachute activated. The parachute caught the wind and allowed Spider-Man to get off Vulture's grip, crashing him into the lake below. The parachute hindered Spider-Man and he struggled to release himself from it, seemingly about to drown. All of a sudden, \nIron Man\n appeared and rescued him, managing to pull him out of the lake and onto dry land before he could drown.\n[\n4\n]\nSaved by Iron Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is soon confronted by \nIron Man\n \n \n\"Can't you just be a friendly... neighborhood Spider-Man?\"\n\"But I'm ready for more than that now.\"\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\"That's not what you thought when I \ntook\n on \nCaptain America\n.\"\n\"Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would've. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call \nHappy\n.\"\n\nIron Man\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nPulling him up from the lake, \nTony Stark\n talked to Parker as he dried off in the neighborhood playground. Parker had inquired how Stark knew where was, asking if he put a tracker into the \nSpider-Man Suit\n before Stark then revealed that he actually did put a tracker inside the suit, along with various other advanced features, including a heater to dry him off following his near-drowning inside the lake. Spider-Man suggested that the \nAvengers\n might need to get involved to bring down \nVulture's Crew\n, but Iron Man insisted the situation with \nVulture\n was below the Avengers' pay grade.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man and \nIron Man\n discuss \nVulture\n \n \nAs Parker insisted that Stark did not have to have come all the way out to help him, Stark then revealed that he was not there in person and that he was remotely controlling the \nMark XLVII Armor\n while he was currently in \nIndia\n. While Iron Man insisted that he stop looking into Vulture and just protect \nNew York City\n from muggers, Spider-Man insisted he was ready for more, pointing to his fight with \nCaptain America\n, but Stark had still refused to accept this explanation.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man discovering \nChitauri\n weapons\n \n \nOnce Stark had left, \nNed Leeds\n called Parker and advised him not to return to the party since \nFlash Thompson\n had continued to make a mockery out of him while he had been gone. As Spider-Man began to leave the area, he discovered a \nChitauri Energy Core\n that had been left behind by Brice and Schultz during the chase, while Spider-Man took it away to attempt to get a lead on what weaponry the criminals were working with and how to eventually track them all down.\n[\n4\n]\nTracking Vulture\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n test the technology\n \n \n\"\nWhoever\n's making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours.\"\n\"That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey...\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nDespite his talk of desisting with \nTony Stark\n, Parker still began investigating his new adversary. He had told \nNed Leeds\n about his own terrifying encounter with \nVulture\n and his discovery of their \nChitauri Energy Core\n which had been left behind in the wake of his chase with \nJackson Brice\n. While Leeds expressed his delight at merely being a part of this situation, Parker used a hammer to break the core, as \nBarry Hapgood\n advised his students to keep their fingers clear of the blades, while Parker and Leeds agreed on what to do next before doing their own traditional handshake.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker attempting to follow \nHerman Schultz\n \n \nOnce they had spent some time examining the \nChitauri\n power core which Leeds could only think to call their glowy thingy, they had then encountered \nHerman Schultz\n and \nRandy Vale\n who had both arrived while they were still searching for the core through \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n. While Parker dragged Leeds out of the way, he explained that Schultz had attempted to kill him the night before alongside \nJackson Brice\n. Although Leeds insisted that they run and hide, Parker noted that by following them he could try and get a lead on Vulture, ignoring Leeds' pleas as he attempted to follow Schultz and Vale, as they searched through the school.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker puts a tracker onto \nHerman Schultz\n \n \nHaving eventually managed to convince a reluctant Leeds to stay put beside \nTiny McKeever\n's chess game for his safety, Parker followed Schultz and Vale during their search, as they then made their way into Hapgood's workshop where they had just been studying. Hiding underneath a table, Parker watched as Schultz and Vale eventually gave up their search and, as they were both leaving the school, Parker then fired his \nSpider-Tracer\n onto Schultz's shoe.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker waits to learn of \nVulture\n's location\n \n \nReturning to the \nParker Residence\n together, Parker and Leeds used the Tracer on Schultz's boot to begin following the gang's current movements as they made their way outside of \nNew York City\n. While Leeds marveled at all the technology that \nTony Stark\n had supplied Parker with, Parker himself passed the time by experimenting with the \nSpider-Signal\n and some of the other bits of tech all while Leeds had still continued closely following Schultz's movements. In boredom, Leeds asked Parker to wear his mask, finding it to be rather awesome.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n locate \nVulture\n \n \nEventually, while Leeds was trying on the \nSpider-Man Mask\n and Parker was resting on the ceiling, they learned that Schultz and Vale had finally stopped in \nMaryland\n. While they discussed with Schultz and his gang had an \nevil lair\n, they discussed how they would get to Maryland, with Parker remembering that the Decathlon was taking place in \nWashington, D.C.\n so he could get a lift with their team who were heading out the next day for the Decathlon finals.\n[\n4\n]\nDecathlon Trip\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker rejoins the \nschool\n's decathlon team\n \n \n\"I'm sick of \nhim\n treating me like a kid all the time! It's not cool!\"\n\"But you \nare\n a kid.\"\n\"Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands!\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nSeeking to get a lift to \nMaryland\n to intercept Vulture's Crew, Parker ran up to the decathlon team as they were all heading onto the bus to \nWashington, D.C.\n for the national tournament, asking to rejoin the team. Although \nFlash Thompson\n protested the idea as he had taken Parker's spot, \nRoger Harrington\n was delighted to have Parker back and immediately agreed. Thompson then reluctantly returned Parker's spot and team jacket to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker fields a phone call from \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nDuring the bus ride to Washington, D.C., \nLiz Allan\n quizzed the team to get them ready for Nationals, with Parker even correctly answering a question about \nVibranium\n. However, Parker excused himself when he got a call from \nHappy Hogan\n, who wondered why he had just left \nNew York City\n, having followed the tracker in the \nSpider-Man Suit\n. Parker answered that he was on a school trip and managed to convince Hogan that the situation was no big deal, although Hogan reminded Parker that he would still be watching him.\n[\n4\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker overlooking the \nTriskelion\n cleanup\n \n \nWhile nearing their destination, Parker and Leeds caught sight of the wreckage of the \nTriskelion\n still present. \nMichelle Jones\n came over to them and explained that the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n was still clearing up the destruction left behind by \nCaptain America\n during the \nBattle at the Triskelion\n several years prior. While Jones expressed her own conspiracy theories about these events, Parker wondered where Damage Control would take all the equipment and technology that they recovered.\n[\n19\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n hack into his suit\n \n \nIn their hotel room, Parker began removing the tracker from inside his Suit with Leeds' help, as he did not want \nTony Stark\n to know that he would be following \nVulture's Crew\n to their base. When Leeds questioned him now lying to \nIron Man\n, Parker insisted that he was not lying but just wanted Stark to fully understand everything he could do as a hero. Parker successfully found and pried off the tracker from his suit's circuits which he placed on a lamp, leaving Hogan to track that instead.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is upset over being treated like a kid\n \n \nLeeds then discovered that the suit had many advanced subsystems which were all currently disabled by the \nTraining Wheels Protocol\n, much to Parker's frustration. He believed he did not require such limitations in the suit, complaining how Stark still treated him as a child. Parker managed to convince Leeds to override the protocol despite his friend's misgivings over the decision. Parker claimed that doing this favor for him would make Leeds his guy in the chair, while also allowing Parker to truly prove himself to Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is invited swimming by \nLiz Allan\n \n \nHaving seen that \nHerman Schultz\n was on the move again, Parker donned the suit under his clothes and prepared to track him down, also requesting Leeds to look after the \nChitauri Energy Core\n while he was gone. Just as he began making his way out, Parker then encountered Allan, who along with the rest of their Decathlon team was about to sneak into the hotel pool to go swimming, with Thompson running by and slapping Parker on his behind. Parker, however, claimed he could not join him because he was going to study.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker decides to leave his friends behind\n \n \nDespite Allan having expressed just how important winning this competition was to her and her belief that the team engaging in a rebellious activity together could boost their ability, Parker still decided to prioritize tracking down \nVulture\n and the rest of his men. Sitting outside a window in the Spider-Man Suit, Parker wistfully watched Allan playing in the pool with Thompson, \nCindy Moon\n and the rest, enjoying themselves as Parker remained alone, focused on his current mission.\n[\n4\n]\nDamage Control Truck Attack\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries looking for \nVulture's Crew\n \n \n\"Hey, \nBig Bird\n, this doesn't belong to you!\"\nSpider-Man to \nVulture\n[src]\nUpon donning the \nSpider-Man Suit\n with removed restrictions, Spider-Man discovered that the suit was harboring his own personal \nA.I.\n system. Upon introducing herself to him and congratulating him on seemingly passing through the \nTraining Wheels Protocol\n, the A.I. began to teach Spider-Man all about the suit's full capabilities. Spider-Man then told the A.I. about the \nSpider-Tracer\n and he was shown exactly where it was and how to find it as they traveled through \nWashington, D.C.\n to find the Tracer's location.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man finally finds \nHerman Schultz\n \n \nBefore long they located \nVulture's Crew\n near an empty gas station, which Spider-Man mistook for their \nHeadquarters\n. Using the suit's advanced function to overhear their conversation, Spider-Man then overheard \nHerman Schultz\n and \nPhineas Mason\n talking together as they discussed getting \nShocker's Gauntlet\n from \nCrossbones\n before Spider-Man then learned that the crew intended to steal confiscated alien tech from the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n transfer trucks coming by shortly.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries out his new \nWeb-Shooters\n \n \nAs Spider-Man prepared to engage with Vulture's Crew, his new A.I. recommended new features active in his suit, only for Spider-Man to discover she meant an \n\"instant kill mode\"\n which he rejected, not wishing to kill anyone. The A.I. then showed Spider-Man his new \nWeb-Shooters\n and it's many more advanced web-shooter combinations. However, Spider-Man was still learning, this resulted in him picking the wrong options and falling on his face before electrocuting the gas station.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man witnesses \nVulture\n's robbery\n \n \nSpider-Man had then witnessed the arrival of \nVulture\n, who was using his \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n to catch up with and attach himself to the Damage Control truck that was driving by. Spider-Man went after the truck and found Vulture had used a \nMatter Phase Shifter\n to get inside where he was stealing all of the \nChitauri\n and \nUltron\n based technology that he could get his hands on. Taking his bag from him, Spider-Man confronted Vulture when he was about to leave.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is forced into fighting \nVulture\n \n \nVulture, however, refused to allow Spider-Man to take his profit away from him and reattached himself to his Exo-Suit and furiously attacked Spider-Man. Spider-Man managed to \ndodge the attack\n, however, he discovered that the Webs that his A.I. had selected were useless in the fight. While Spider-Man was forced to desperately avoid all Vulture's attacks, he had then begged his A.I. to fix his webs while Vulture still furiously attempted to take his bag back.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is knocked out inside of the van\n \n \nDuring the course of the battle, Spider-Man pulled the bag back from Vulture and fell back inside the van, causing the bag to fall with him while the Matter Phase Shifter closed behind him. Not noticing that the Phase Shifter had closed, Spider-Man accidentally knocked himself unconscious when he banged his head against the ceiling in his hasty attempt to get out, allowing Vulture time to make his escape, despite still losing the bag full of stolen technology.\n[\n4\n]\nTrapped in the Storage Vault\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man prepares to confront \nVulture\n \n \n\"Karen, you have to help me override that time lock. Lower the voltage and run it.\"\n\"Trial unsuccessful.\"\n\"Okay, we're just gonna have to try every sequence.\"\nSpider-Man and \nKaren\n[src]\nSpider-Man eventually awoke inside the truck, as the \nAI\n informed him that he appeared to have a mild concussion from \nsmashing his head\n into the truck's ceiling. Hours later, Spider-Man questioned where he was, although his A.I. was unsure, leading Spider-Man to conclude that the truck had been hijacked and taken into Vulture's \nheadquarters\n, leading Spider-Man to believe that they would have to fight their way to freedom. Charging towards the doors, Spider-Man then smashed through and expected to be confronted by the rest of Vulture's \ncrew\n, only to discover he was in a massive federal warehouse.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man being trapped inside the \nfacility\n \n \nWhile he looked around confused, the A.I then informed Spider-Man that he was inside the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n's \nDeep Storage Vault\n and that he would most likely not be able to leave until the following morning. At first, Spider-Man desperately attempted to force the door open to no avail, kicking it in annoyance before finally giving up and exploring the facility. While waiting, Spider-Man discussed giving the AI her own name, soon deciding on \nKaren\n which she approved of.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man names his suit's AI \nKaren\n \n \nDeciding to wait it out, Spider-Man then spent some time learning his different \nWeb-Shooters\n combinations such as the web-grenade and web-net, ricochet web, splitter web, and web-wings, also looking at the \nSpider-Man Suit\n's upgrades which included wings. During all this time, Spider-Man made a hammock from his web-shooters and lay in it, seemingly nothing to do but just wait the night. Spider-Man talked to her about his close feelings for \nLiz Allan\n with Karen.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man searches for the technology\n \n \nEventually, Parker asked how many minutes have gone by, Karen had replied with thirty-seven minutes, growing impatient and he went on to explore, searching through \nVulture\n's duffel bag he left behind. Finding \nUltron\n's head and another purple \nChitauri\n power core, Karen told Spider-Man that \nChitauri Energy Core\n will explode if exposed to enough radiation. Horrified and knowing that \nNed Leeds\n had still the core with him, Spider-Man realized his friend was in danger.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to unlock the door\n \n \nSpider-Man immediately began to try to get himself out of the Vault as he worked together with Karen to attempt to manually open the door by tinkering with the fuse box. Following two hundred and forty-seven attempts of using different combinations to unlock the door, Spider-Man then managed to open the door and immediately began making his journey back to \nWashington, D.C.\n, while still desperately attempting to contact Leeds and inform him of the danger.\n[\n4\n]\nWashington Monument Rescue\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man rushes back to save his friends\n \n \n\"Hey, don't worry. I got you.\"\n\"Yes! Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\"Hey, big guy! Quit movin' around!\"\n\"So sorry, sir. So sorry.\"\nSpider-Man and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nAfter managing to get out of the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n facility, Spider-Man then desperately begged \nKaren\n to track down his friends while he hitched rides on passing vehicles being unable to swing to the city. Spider-Man had continued to call \nNed Leeds\n numerous times, but found Leeds had no signal to pick up. As he was missing, \nFlash Thompson\n took Parker's place in the Decathlon, much to \nLiz Allan\n's annoyance, although they still managed to win their competition. Parker tracked all his friends to the \nWashington Monument\n and just reached the Monument at the moment the \nChitauri Energy Core\n exploded, causing massive damage.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man learns his friends are in danger\n \n \nUpon finally arriving on the scene, Spider-Man had looked up as the Monument and had found \nMichelle Jones\n sitting outside who had then informed him that all of her friends were now currently trapped inside the Monument elevator with seemingly no way out. \nKaren\n then confirmed that the elevator had just been severely damaged by the Energy Core's explosion and that it would then plummet all the way back down to the ground floor in just a short amount of time.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man climbs \nWashington Monument\n \n \nWith limited time to act, Spider-Man immediately began to crawl on the Monument and tried to reach the top as quickly as he can. Using his \nWeb-Shooters\n, Spider-Man attempted to propel himself forward with more speed; however, he found himself becoming intimidated by the height he was now at, with Karen informed him that since he had used his only parachute from the \nSpider-Man Suit\n during his recent encounter with \nVulture\n, if he fell off the Monument then he would very likely be killed as a result, which he did not appreciate.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man trying to enter the \nMonument\n \n \nAs Spider-Man reached the top of the Monument where his friends were in danger, his \nrescue attempt\n gained the attention of the local authority who dispatched a helicopter to confront him and order him away. Spider-Man attempted to explain the situation to them, but they instead started to demand Spider-Man to leave the monument and get back on the ground on the threat of being shot, however, Spider-Man sent the \nSpider-Tracer\n to find a way into the Monument.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man rescues all of his classmates\n \n \nIgnoring the threats, Spider-Man managed to enter the monument by jumping over the helicopter blades with the aid of the wings on the suit before then swinging back towards the monument and breaking through the windows. He barely managed to get inside in time to hold the elevator with his \nWeb-Shooters\n as it started to plummet to the ground. Spider-Man managed to save his schoolmates and his teacher \nRoger Harrington\n who were trapped in the elevator.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to save \nLiz Allan\n \n \nWhile \nNed Leeds\n celebrated the rescue, Spider-Man told him to stop moving as he helped everyone to safety. However, \nLiz Allan\n fell and Spider-Man was forced to catch her mid-air and pull her back up to the safety of her friends. While hanging upside down, Spider-Man checked that Allan was safe while Karen recommended that he kiss her. However, Spider-Man's web then snapped, causing him to fall, while \nFlash Thompson\n questioned if he knew Parker.\n[\n4\n]\nBack to New York\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker enjoys the attention on Spider-Man\n \n \n\"What happened to your voice?\"\n\"What do you mean, 'What happened to my voice?'\"\n\"I heard you by the bridge, I know what a girl sounds like.\"\n\"I'm not a girl! I'm a boy! I mean, I'm a man!\"\n\nAaron Davis\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nIn the wake of the \nevents\n in \nWashington, D.C.\n, Parker returned to \nNew York City\n where he had been delighted to see all of the new positive attention being put on Spider-Man following the success of the \nRescue at the Washington Monument\n. As he walked down \ntheir school\n's hallways, Parker saw school news reports by \nBetty Brant\n and \nJason Ionello\n discussing Spider-Man's heroic actions saving his classmates.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n discuss Spider-Man\n \n \nWhile Parker was making his way through all the school's hallways, he was then greeted by \nNed Leeds\n who questioned what it was like being famous without anyone actually knowing it was him. Parker told Leeds once again to not tell anybody the truth. Parker revealed he was not going to class, noting that he figured out \nVulture\n was using the technology stolen from the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n to make weapons and all he had to do now was catch Vulture in the act.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is forced to sit down in detention\n \n \nAs Parker expressed his belief that \nTony Stark\n would soon recruit him into the \nAvengers\n for an act of great heroism, he therefore concluded he need not have to worry about attending school, just as \nMorita\n overheard and then gave him detention for planning on skipping class. In detention with \nMichelle Jones\n, Parker watched a video of \nCaptain America\n before decided to walk out, with \nAndre Wilson\n not even bothering to attempt to stop Parker, who had proceeded to collect his hidden \nSynthetic Webbing\n and left the school.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nKaren\n discussing \nAaron Davis\n \n \nReturned home into the \nParker Residence\n, Parker immediately resumed his hunt for \nVulture\n as he donned the \nSpider-Man Mask\n and spoke with \nKaren\n. Parker asked if Karen could help him identify the men he encountered under the bridge, as she revealed that she had access to video files through the \nBaby Monitor Protocol\n. Parker then watched the footage, seeing \nJackson Brice\n and \nHerman Schultz\n as they threatened another man before Spider-Man had stepped in.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man arrives to confront \nAaron Davis\n \n \nSpider-Man had learned from Karen that the buyer was \nAaron Davis\n, a criminal who was living in \nNew York City\n and Spider-Man then went to confront him. Using the \nSpider-Drone\n to find Davis in a car park, Spider-Man proceeded to use his \nWeb-Shooters\n to trap Davis to his car bonnet. At Karen's suggestion, Spider-Man put on \"Intimidation Mode\" which had amplified his vocal volume with voice modulation into a more intimidating presence. However, Davis soon saw through the deception, noting their previous encounter, which had Parker turn it off.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to interrogate \nAaron Davis\n \n \nSpider-Man demanded Davis tell him Vulture's location, insisting that he needed to know where to find the weapons and threatened Davis if he refused to tell him. Davis, however, was not intimidated and slammed his car bonnet down, making Spider-Man jump. Davis then questioned if Spider-Man had ever interrogated anyone before and then asked if Spider-Man knew about \nDelmar's Deli-Grocery\n, noting his own shock went it had been \ndestroyed\n during a robbery.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man learning of \nVulture\n's location\n \n \n Grateful for saving him the other night when Schultz had tried to kill him, and caring for \nhis nephew\n's safety, Davis informed Spider-Man about another weapons deal that would take place on involving Vulture and \nMac Gargan\n. In his excitement at getting a lead, Spider-Man almost left before being told this was happening on the \nStaten Island Ferry\n. Davis had advised Spider-Man at getting better at being intimidating before Spider-Man left Davis stuck to his car.\n[\n4\n]\nStaten Island Ferry Incident\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man climbs the \nStaten Island Ferry\n \n \n\"The illegal weapons ferry was at 10:30! You missed it!\"\nSpider-Man to \nMac Gargan\n[src]\nFollowing the lead given by \nAaron Davis\n, Spider-Man raced expeditiously across \nNew York City\n and had managed to sneak on board the \nStaten Island Ferry\n by using the wings on his \nSpider-Man Suit\n to sour above the water and attach himself to the side of the Ferry. Spider-Man then went looking for \nVulture\n, finding a man he assumed was the criminal speaking with \nHerman Schultz\n. He learned that they were about to deal with \nMac Gargan\n to which \nKaren\n provided information about.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man spies on \nMac Gargan\n's deal\n \n \nDuring his scouting, \nTony Stark\n called Parker with the intention of apologizing for not answering his calls and having Parker instead try to speak with \nHappy Hogan\n. While Stark was still speaking to him, however, he could see that \nRandy Vale\n was preparing to hand over the \nChitauri\n weapons to Gargan and the other criminals, so Spider-Man was forced to hang up on the annoyed Stark in order to focus on his targets before it was too late and Gargan got away.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man interrupts the weapons deal\n \n \nSpider-Man interrupted the deal and stealing the keys to the truck with all the \nChitauri\n and \nUltron\n based technology and then began fighting against the \ncrew\n and Gargan's men. Spider-Man also fought against Schultz who had also gained possession of the \nShocker's Gauntlet\n from \nJackson Brice\n and then attempted to strike him with it. Spider-Man managed to defeat them, knocking Gargan overboard and trapping Schultz's arm, jokingly commenting that Brice had been considerably better with the Gauntlet than Schultz had been.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to subdue \nShocker\n \n \nHaving also trapped \nRandy Vale\n with his web grenade, Spider-Man caught sight of the criminal Schultz had been speaking to earlier, assuming this was \nVulture\n unmasked. Before Spider-Man could confront the man, however, he was then interrupted by \nFBI\n agents who had begun arresting everyone including Spider-Man who they mistook for Gargan's ally, much to Spider-Man's surprise as he tried to insist that he was not actually one of the criminals in this situation.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nVulture\n \n \nThis distraction was all Vulture needed to don \nhis suit\n and began attacking Spider-Man and the FBI agents. While Spider-Man protected and saved the agents from the villain's attacks, Vulture freed his men and urged them to escape. Another fierce fight ensued as Vulture tried to kill Spider-Man with his advanced weaponry. Spider-Man countered by using his new \nWeb-Shooters\n advanced function to even the odds, webbing Vulture to a car in an attempt to slow him down.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to disarm the \nChitauri\n gun\n \n \nVulture managed to free himself of Spider-Man's webbing by cutting through them with his wings and continued attacking him. Eventually, the fight resulted in Vulture's \nChitauri\n alien weapon malfunctioning. Spider-Man tried to webbed the weapon up only for Vulture to say he was dealing with things he did not understand. The weapon had then exploded and cut the ferry in half while Spider-Man could only look on in utter horror as innocent people's lives were put in danger.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man quickly trying to save the ferry\n \n \nWhile Spider-Man overlooked the situation, Vulture and Schultz then managed to escape as Spider-Man desperately tried to save the people who were trapped inside the ferry which was slowly beginning to split in half. \nKaren\n quickly calculated all the strongest points of the ship and Spider-Man quickly went to work by webbing the strongest points together. By using his \nWeb-Shooters\n and his enhanced speed, Spider-Man had seemingly managed to hold the ship together.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man learns his attempts have failed\n \n \nTaking a moment to catch his breath following his desperate attempt to save the ferry from splitting in half and sinking into the sea, Spider-Man overlooked his work as a member of the public cheered him on, only to learn that his missed one spot and the ship began collapsing once again. As the webs snapped one by one in quick succession, water began pouring inside the ferry, knocking people overboard and putting the lives of everybody still there in serious risk.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to hold the \nFerry\n together\n \n \nIn complete desperation to keep people out of harm's way, Spider-Man proceeded to web up the sides of the ship and painfully held both halves of the ship by himself in a herculean effort to save the ship, but his efforts barely made a difference as the ship continued to split apart and sink. However, then Spider-Man noticed that the ship had seemingly stopped sinking and it had stopped being painful to hold the ship together. \nIron Man\n then revealed himself and had come to rescue the civilians, taking control away from Spider-Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempting to assist \nIron Man\n \n \nWhile Spider-Man could only watch on, Iron Man proceeded to use a series of mini-thrusters from his \nMark XLVII Armor\n to use the sides of the ship back together, getting a cheer from the same man who had cheered on Spider-Man moments earlier. Iron Man had then quickly rebuilt the ship by reforging the cutlines, ignoring Spider-Man's offers to help by claiming he had done enough already. Once the ship was repaired, Iron Man took Spider-Man away to talk in private.\n[\n4\n]\nFinal Test\n[\n]\nLosing His Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker contemplates his near-fatal mistake\n \n \n\"I'm gonna need the \nsuit\n back.\"\n\"No!

I'm nothing without this suit!\"\n\"If you're nothing without that suit, then you shouldn't have it.\"\n\nTony Stark\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nFollowing the resolution of the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n, Parker sat on the outskirts of \nNew York City\n and watched the people being rescued before \nIron Man\n then approached him. Stark admonished Parker for his recklessness as his actions would have resulted in innocent people dying, but a frustrated Parker countered that he tried to warn Stark of the danger of \nVulture\n and his \ncriminal crew\n, but Stark had simply refused to listen to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man furiously arguing with \nIron Man\n \n \nHe further said that if Stark actually cared about the situation, then he would be here in person. Stark responded to this by stepping out of the \nMark XLVII Armor\n and answered that he did listen to Parker. Stark told Parker that he was the only one who believed in him in spite of everyone else, including \nHappy Hogan\n, believing he had been crazy to recruit a kid and he was the one who tipped off the \nFBI\n about Vulture and they would have succeeded if it was not for Parker's actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is told to return the \nSpider-Man Suit\n \n \nThen Stark demanded the \nSpider-Man Suit\n back, but Parker tearfully protested and pleaded that the suit was all he had and that he was nothing without it. Stark then replied that if he depends on the suit to be special, then he should not have it. Relenting, Parker stuttered that he has nothing else to wear if he takes off the suit, to which Stark told Parker he would take care of that. Before bringing him to the \nParker Residence\n, Stark then bought Parker a shirt and pink pajamas.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is furiously confronted by \nAunt May\n \n \nGetting home, Parker found \nAunt May\n frustrated and worried for him, as she explained how she had been calling everywhere for Parker's whereabouts, including police stations within \nNew York City\n and the mother of \nNed Leeds\n' as she had learned Parker had been skipping classes and detention before witnessing the incident on the Ferry on the news. Noting how she knew he left the hotel room in \nWashington, D.C.\n and sneaked out their home each night but did not know why.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being kindly comforted by \nAunt May\n \n \nDesperate for answers, May demanded to know what he has been doing every night without her knowledge. In tears, Parker covered it up by explaining that the reason he had seemingly been rebelling was that he had lost the \nStark Industries\n' Internship, claiming that despite how hard he had worked, he had managed to screw it up. While Parker sadly sat down, May believed his story and simply comforted her nephew, while Parker apologized for getting her so worried about him. May then finished their conversation by noting that she used to sneak out as well and recommending that Parker take a shower as she claimed he smelled like garbage.\n[\n4\n]\nReturn to School\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sent out of Principal \nMorita\n's office\n \n \n\"I guess you already have a date to homecoming.\"\n\"Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so...\"\n\"Do you want to... go with me?\"\nPeter Parker and \nLiz Allan\n[src]\nWhile being initially demoralized by the recent events with Vulture and the loss of his \nSpider-Man Suit\n, Parker chose the accept his forced retirement and rationalized that his goal of joining the Avengers was doomed to fail due to their permanent move to the \nAvengers Compound\n. As he accepted that he should return to his daily life at \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n,\n[\n22\n]\n Parker was then sent to the office of Principal \nMorita\n who insisted that Parker was a good kid but gave him considerably more detention, much to \nNed Leeds\n' relief as he assumed Parker was expelled.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is forced to sit at a longer detention\n \n \nAs demanded by Principal Morita, Parker was sent to sit into more detentions, with only Coach \nAndre Wilson\n and \nMichelle Jones\n for keeping herself company, Jones drew her sketches of Parker looking sad to entertain herself. However, the time away from being Spider-Man had allowed Parker to improve in his schoolwork, specifically in Spanish while he and Leeds finished the \nLego Death Star\n they had worked on for several months, much to their considerable satisfaction.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker finally apologizes to \nLiz Allan\n \n \nWith their upcoming homecoming celebration coming soon, Parker had begun to prepare himself for the celebration. In school, he met up with \nLiz Allan\n, as he talked to her and apologized for missing the Decathlon final in \nWashington, D.C.\n, although Allan insisted that her \nnear death experience\n had also caused her to reevaluate her priorities. Parker then finally confessed that he liked Allan, which she admitted to already knowing, claiming that Parker was terrible at keeping secrets, making Parker chuckle. Building up all his courage, Parker learned Allan had been too busy handling the celebration to find a date, as Parker then took the chance to ask her out.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks \nLiz Allan\n to go to homecoming\n \n \nTo Parker's great surprise, Allan accepted his offer. Delighted and suddenly overcome with awkwardness, Parker commented on how Principal Morita had given him considerable amounts of detention before noting that he was currently walking the wrong way to class. As he walked past Allan and back towards his next lesson, Parker could not help but have a massive smile on his face as his attraction to Allan was finally confirmed to be mutually shared by her.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asking for assistance from \nAunt May\n \n \nStill delighted, Parker hurriedly returned to the \nParker Residence\n and immediately asked \nAunt May\n for her assistance to get ready for the homecoming dance to ensure that he was able to impress Allan. With the help of May, Parker had learned to dress for the celebration which included spraying himself with some questionable aftershave and learning how to correctly tie a tie, which Parker had struggled to figure out until finally checking with May that he got it right.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is taught how to dance by \nAunt May\n \n \nMay also assisted Parker in learning how to dance and, although he found it quite awkward, the support and care he got from his Aunt allowed Parker to relax as he prepared himself for the dance. Parker also wrapped up a flower corsage which he had intended to give to Allan as a gift. On the evening for Homecoming, May drove Parker to the \nToomes Residence\n in order to pick up his date, as he prepared himself for the enjoyable evening with the beautiful Allan.\n[\n4\n]\nVulture's Secret\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is shocked to see \nAdrian Toomes\n \n \n\"Does \nshe\n know?\"\n\"Know what?\"\n\"So she doesn't, good. Close to the vest, I admire that.\"\n\nAdrian Toomes\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nParker headed to the \nToomes Residence\n and then rang the doorbell, nervously waiting for \nLiz Allan\n's parents to open the door and greet him. Much to his dread, \nAdrian Toomes\n opened the door, who Parker had immediately recognized as \nVulture\n having once seen his face during the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n, Parker was on guard while the unaware Toomes greeted Parker and welcomed him into his home, commenting on what a strong grip Parker had when they shook hands.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker considering \nAdrian Toomes\n's secrets\n \n \nWhile the confused and quietly terrified Parker made his way through the house, he tried to hide his displeasure from Adrian as well as the revelation that his date's father was the man he has been hunting all this time. As \nDoris Toomes\n also greeted him, Adrian noted that Parker looked pale and jokingly offered him a whiskey or scotch, which Parker then turned down by noting that he was too young to drink, which Adrian confirmed was the correct answer to say to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker taking some pictures with \nLiz Allan\n \n \nThey were then joined by \nLiz Allan\n who showed off her dress intended for the party, with Adrian commenting on how beautiful she was, while Parker was so taken aback by the truth about Liz's father that he could barely bring himself to speak. As they prepared to leave, Doris insisted on taking some pictures, during which Parker to hardly keep his horrified eyes away from Adrian. After awkwardly taken pictures with Liz, Adrian then agreed to drive the two to the celebration.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is driven to \nschool\n by \nAdrian Toomes\n \n \nAs they drove to \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n, Parker was asked by Adrian about what he planned to do once he finished school, with Liz noting how he had a \nStark Industries\n internship and got to hang out with \nTony Stark\n and Spider-Man, which seemed to interest Adrian. While they drove, Adrian questioned if he and Parker had ever met before, noting that even Parker's voice was familiar to him, with Liz noting that Parker also did Decathlon with her.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker attempts to conceal his own secrets\n \n \nAs the conversation continued, Liz casually noted how Parker had disappeared the night of her party and during \nWashington, D.C.\n Hearing this, Toomes realized these were the times Spider-Man had intercepted his \narms deal\n and \nattempted robbery\n and was able to deduce that Parker was Spider-Man based on this information as well as the similarity with Parker's voice. Parker, however, attempted to remain calm while Adrian looked him directly in the eyes.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is given a warning by \nAdrian Toomes\n \n \nStopping outside the school, Adrian told his daughter to get inside first while he has a dad talk with Parker, who became considerably more nervous being alone in the car with \nVulture\n. Once alone, Toomes showed his true colors by pulling a gun outside of the glove compartment and asked Parker if Liz knew that he was Spider-Man to which Parker declined, as Toomes noted that he had secrets of his own that he still intended to keep quiet from his own family.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is scared by \nAdrian Toomes\n' threats\n \n \nNoting how important his family was to him, Toomes warned Parker to stay away from his business as he told Parker that he was grateful that he \nsaved his daughter's life\n and for that, he gave him one final chance to walk away with his life if he had agreed that he would not interfere with Vulture's \nupcoming heist\n. Toomes gave Parker one final warning that if he chose to pursue him, he would kill him as well as everyone he loved, including \nAunt May\n which terrified Parker.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker attending the Homecoming dance\n \n \nAs Parker had begun heading toward the celebration, he was in deep misgivings, as he could stay and be with Liz, which was what he still wanted, but that would mean leaving Vulture to steal \nChitauri\n as well as \nUltron\n based technology from \nStark Industries\n which would mean more weapons being sold in \nNew York City\n that will inevitably result with innocent people dying. He could pursue Vulture and bring him to justice, but that would mean Liz would lose her father.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker telling \nLiz Allan\n that he has to leave\n \n \nUltimately, Parker chose his responsibility as Spider-Man. He entered the dance and found Liz with \nMichelle Jones\n and \nNed Leeds\n among others, but Parker walked past his friends and straight towards Liz, who assumed her father had threatened him. Parker apologized to Liz, telling her that she deserved better and then left her. Parker then grabbed his original \nSpider-Man Suit\n and \nWeb-Shooters\n that he had stashed beneath the lockers and then ran after Vulture.\n[\n4\n]\nShocker's Ambush\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nShocker\n \n \n\"Why did \nhe\n send you here?\"\n\"Guess you'll never know.\"\nSpider-Man and \nShocker\n[src]\nHastily putting on the original homemade \nSpider-Man Suit\n, Spider-Man then ran outside only to be ambushed by \nShocker\n, who had been tasked by \nVulture\n to kill Spider-Man if he had broken their agreement. Spider-Man was unprepared for his presence and was struck directly in the face with some considerable force, with his enemy's attack causing him to lose both of his \nWeb-Shooters\n, which had put him at a strong disadvantage.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man smashes into a school bus\n \n \nWhile Shocker mocked his homemade costume, Spider-Man made a desperate attempt to reclaim his Web-Shooters, only for Shocker to use his \nGauntlet\n to knock a school bus into Spider-Man. Shocker was relentless and kept \nattacking\n Spider-Man, smashing him through a school bus while commenting on how powerful his Gauntlet was, which Spider-Man fell through the bus and found some gum trapped under the seats which Spider-Man commented were disgusting.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man's life is saved by \nNed Leeds\n \n \nAs Shocker overturned the bus with another powerful strike from his Gauntlet, Spider-Man was rolled over and crawled out, dazed and in considerable pain from the beatings. On the ground, Spider-Man had questioned why \nAdrian Toomes\n had sent him here, to which Shocker replied that he would never know. Before Shocker could strike once again, Spider-Man was saved by the timely arrival of \nNed Leeds\n who managed to stop Shocker's attack with the Web-Shooter.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man goes off in pursuit of \nVulture\n \n \nImmediately taking the advantage, Spider-Man defeated Shocker and webbed him against a school bus, leaving him to be arrested by the \nNYPD\n. In a haste, Spider-Man had then informed Leeds about Vulture's true identity as \nLiz Allan\n's father and told him that they needed to inform \nTony Stark\n of the situation. As Spider-Man swung away from the scene, he told Leeds to call \nHappy Hogan\n and to keep track of his phone so they could still stay within contact.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man stealing \nFlash Thompson\n's car\n \n \nSeeking some transportation to get across \nNew York City\n to find Vulture, Spider-Man found and stopped \nFlash Thompson\n who was on his way to the homecoming dance with his date while complaining about the dinner they had just eaten. Spider-Man then stopped Thompson by jumping onto the hood of the car and demanded him to get out of the car and hand over both the keys and his phone, using a gravely deeper voice to appear more intimidating. Despite Thompson insisting that it was his \nfather\n's car, Spider-Man still then drove away in Thompson's car, briefly crashing into a rack of bikes, much to Thompson's horror.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man drives to \nVulture\n's location\n \n \nWhile driving, Parker used Thompson's phone to call Leeds, telling him that he left his own phone in Toomes' car for them to track. While Parker continued struggling to drive, Hogan refused to take Leeds' call as he was busy emptying \nAvengers Tower\n into the \nStark Cargo Plane\n, at which point Parker realized that was what Vulture had planned to hijack. They then tracked Vulture to his \nHeadquarters\n as Parker sped towards his location, accidentally crashing the car.\n[\n4\n]\nConfronting Vulture\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man goes in search for \nVulture\n \n \n\"I understand selling weapons to criminals is wrong.\"\n\"How do you think your buddy \nStark\n paid for that \ntower\n, huh? Or all his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want.\"\nSpider-Man and \nVulture\n[src]\nWith the aid of \nNed Leeds\n, Spider-Man was able to quickly track down \nAdrian Toomes\n to an \nold warehouse\n. He went inside, using his webbing to glide himself down slowly and discovered computers with information all about \nAvengers Tower\n and the \nStark Cargo Plane\n, as well as also finding \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n. While still exploring the warehouse, Spider-Man eventually found Toomes waiting for him by his work bench.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man finds and confronts \nVulture\n \n \nAs Spider-Man questioned if Toomes was surprised to see him alive after sending \nShocker\n to \nkill him\n outside the \nschool\n, Toomes replied calmly said that he admired Spider-Man's determination, noting that he could see why \nLiz Allan\n liked him. As Spider-Man proceeded to use his \nWeb-Shooters\n to trap Toomes' hand onto the table, he had then demanded to know why Toomes could do all of this to his family; Toomes replied that he was only doing his crimes for them, so as to support them.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man listens to \nVulture\n's reasoning\n \n \nSpider-Man insisted that selling the \nChitauri\n and \nUltron\n weapons on the black market to the criminals like \nMac Gargan\n was wrong, while Toomes countered that men like \nTony Stark\n earned their own fortune with \nStark Industries\n by selling weapons and there was no difference between his crimes and those that Stark had committed. While he had continued talking, Toomes insisted that people like Stark and the rest of the \nAvengers\n did not care about working men like them.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man dodges \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n \n \nAs Spider-Man asked why he was telling him this, Toomes revealed that he wanted him to understand his views and could also remotely control his \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n, as his wings seemingly began attacking Spider-Man. He dodged all of the attacks and taunted Toomes only for him to reply that he was not actually aiming for him. The wings smashed through the last supporting beam of the warehouse and debris collapsed upon Spider-Man. \nVulture\n had then put on his suit and left him to die underneath the rubble.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is trapped underneath rubble\n \n \nBeneath the rubble, Parker awoke and discovered that he was now trapped between two large pieces of debris. Unable to move and barely able to breathe, Parker attempted to free himself by mustering all of his strength, and when this failed, the now terrified Parker then desperately cried for someone to help him, only for his plea for help going unanswered, leaving him alone. Struggling and in pain, Parker spotted his \nSpider-Man Mask\n in the water and his own reflection.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man lifting all the debris off of him\n \n \nJust then, he notices his reflection being overlapped by his mask. Remembering Stark's words to him following the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n, Parker had begun to finally understand what his former mentor meant when he took the \nsuit\n away from him: that with or without the suit, he was the Spider-Man, and the power was all his own. Encouraged by this realization, Spider-Man regained his resolve, mustered his stamina, and began to painfully push all the rubble off of him. Finally, he broke free of his entrapment and reclaimed his mask to determinedly pursued Vulture.\n[\n4\n]\nStopping the Stark Cargo Plane Hijacking\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempting to catch \nVulture\n \n \n\"Just a typical homecoming... on the outside of an \ninvisible jet\n... fighting my \ngirlfriend\n's \ndad\n.\"\nSpider-Man\n[src]\nUpon escaping, Spider-Man managed to find \nVulture\n who stood on the outskirts of the \ndestroyed warehouse\n keeping a close watch on \nAvengers Tower\n. Just as Vulture took off, Spider-Man leapt towards him and webbed onto to him as he flew toward the \nStark Cargo Plane\n which had just taken off with several million dollars' worth of equipment. Feeling slight air drag but unaware of Spider-Man's presence, Vulture continued with his hijacking.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to stop \nVulture\n's robbery\n \n \nAs they soared higher and higher, Spider-Man looked down at \nNew York City\n below as they disappeared through the clouds. When Vulture finally reached the plane, he used the upgrade by Tinkerer and attached himself to crawl into the plane. Spider-Man discovered that his \nWeb-Shooters\n were completely useless at such high altitudes in the air and while traveling at such fast speeds. With no other recourse, he instead attempted to remove \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n that was covering the hole made into the plane.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to avoid \nVulture\n's attacks\n \n \nNot long after Spider-Man managed to nudge the Exo-Suit, it caused the air to rush into the plane through the \nMatter Phase Shifter\n, causing Vulture to learn about his presence and abort his hijacking. Vulture then responded by donning his Exo-Suit and flying around the plane, as Spider-Man commented that his homecoming was anything but typical since he was fighting \nhis date\n's father as another fierce fight happened in the sky between Spider-Man and Vulture.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man almost falls in the plane engine\n \n \nLacking his Stark made \nSpider-Man Suit\n's advanced capabilities, Spider-Man could only improvise and dodged Vulture's relentless attacks. The fight then resulted in extensive damage to the cargo plane as Spider-Man was almost thrown into one of the plane's engines, although he was able to use his Web-Shooters to block up the blades and save his own life, before then kicking away the engine while Vulture continued to fly around him, ready to attack him once again.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man avoiding \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n \n \nCrawling back onto the roof of the plane, Spider-Man managed to dodge out of the way of Vulture's attack, as he began furiously attempting to use his razor-sharp \nVulture Wings\n to slash at Spider-Man and either kill him or knock him overboard or into the engine. Spider-Man managed to keep avoiding the attacks, webbing himself onto the plane to stay on board, as Vulture was then informed by the \nTinkerer\n that his attacks had caused some major damage.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempting to veer off the \nplane\n \n \nSeeing the plane was going down, Spider-Man realized to his horror that the plane was about to crash into \nNew York City\n as thousands of people would be in serious danger if they crashed. While Vulture was still desperately attempting to steal the \nArc Reactors\n and other technology from the plane to make his profit, Spider-Man then used his \nWeb-Shooters\n and strength to change the course of the plane, barely managing to avoid crashing into several skyscrapers.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man stays on the \nplane\n as it crashes\n \n \nHe succeeded in changing direction enough to save the lives of the people in New York; however, before long Spider-Man's webbing had snapped, causing him to be thrown over onto the other wing as he noticed that they were now heading directly towards \nConey Island\n. Spider-Man was then unable to do anything more as the plane then crashed into the beach while being torn apart upon impact as both Spider-Man and Vulture were thrown onto the beach.\n[\n4\n]\nDuel at Coney Island\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man barely survives the plane crash\n \n \n\"Your \nwing-suit\n's going to explode! Stop!\"\n\"Time to go home, Pete.\"\n\"I'm trying to save you!\"\nSpider-Man and \nVulture\n[src]\nExhausted and injured from the \ncrash landing\n, Spider-Man had been forced to take off his \nmask\n in order to breath amidst the scorched air around the crash site. Without the mask on, however, all of Spider-Man's senses had then become overwhelming as he had looked across the burning \nStark Cargo Plane\n. This momentary distraction had allowed \nVulture\n to take him by surprise. Despite all the damage to his adversary's \nwings\n, Vulture maintained a clear advantage over Spider-Man while still being the least injured.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man being beaten down by \nVulture\n \n \nVulture then engaged furiously in his attacking the injured Spider-Man, who barely managed to avoid the attacks as he struggled to shoot his \nWeb-Shooters\n and get a clear shot at Vulture. Despite Spider-Man's best efforts to defend himself from Vulture's attacks, due to being already exhausted, he was unable to focus, and Vulture heavily injured him by pinning Spider-Man to the ground and hitting him repeatedly until Spider-Man caught a fourth punch before launching him high up into the air.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is brutally defeated by \nVulture\n \n \nAs they flew into the air, Vulture attempted to throw Spider-Man into a steel pipe after the latter broke free from his talons, only for Spider-Man to remain airborne due to his webs as they had a clash in mid-air after Spider-Man struck his helmet and landed on him. However, Vulture managed to gain the upper hand when he swiftly dropped and slammed Spider-Man into the ground multiple times, greatly injuring him against the sand banks. Being slightly conscious, Spider-Man was held up off the ground by Vulture's \nWings\n, but as Toomes was about to kill him, he spotted a nearby crate filled with \nStark Industries\n' \nArc Reactors\n that he could just take.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attempting to save \nVulture\n \n \nVulture then left the wounded Spider-Man onto the ground, continuing his mission and went to grab the \nStark Industries\n technology instead to ensure his fortune. Upon is lift-off, Spider-Man then noticed that Vulture's wings were about to explode due to both the radiation overload from the Arc Reactors and the wings' heavy damage from the plane crash and desperately attempted to save him by webbing onto his wings and trying to pull him back. However, Vulture simply refused to listen to Spider-Man's warnings and instead cut the web and then attempted to fly away to his freedom.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man pulling \nVulture\n out of the fire\n \n \nFinally, as Spider-Man had predicted, Vulture's wings did explode as he crashed back down to the ground in flames. Desperate to save the father of \nLiz Allan\n, Spider-Man then went through the flames and managed to find Toomes lying injured, but alive. Spider-Man tried to lift the rubble only suffer a slight burn and attempted it again by letting his hands go under the sand. Spider-Man finally managed to save Toomes, as they both rested and caught their breath back.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sees \nAdrian Toomes\n being arrested\n \n \nWith Vulture finally defeated, Spider-Man then webbed him to the remaining piece of cargo with a note revealing that this was indeed Vulture, with an included apology for what had happened to \nTony Stark\n's own airplane during the clash. Spider-Man then rested on top of a rollercoaster and watched as the \nNew York City Police Department\n eventually arrived onto the scene, along with \nHappy Hogan\n, where they soon found and then arrested Toomes for his many crimes.\n[\n4\n]\nHero of New York\n[\n]\nReturning to School\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNed Leeds\n recount their efforts\n \n \n\"Liz, look, I'm so sorry.\"\n\"You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time? The dance? That um... was a pretty crappy thing to do.\"\n\"Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your \ndad\n... I can't imagine what you're going through. If there's anything I can do to help...\"\nPeter Parker and \nLiz Allan\n[src]\nWith \nVulture\n finally \ndefeated\n and being taken away into custody, everything began to return to normal for Parker again, as he then returned to \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n. While walking through the hallways with \nNed Leeds\n, Parker listened as his best friend continued to recount their \nfight against\n \nShocker\n, in which Leeds had successfully saved Parker from being killed with \nShocker's Gauntlet\n by using Spider-Man's \nWeb-Shooters\n to stop him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker saying his goodbyes to \nLiz Allan\n \n \nHowever, as a direct result of Vulture's arrest and the reveal of his \ncriminal activities\n, \nLiz Allan\n and her \nmother\n decided to move away from \nNew York City\n. As Allan was about to leave school, Parker went over to her and apologized for running out of the Homecoming dance, but once again couldn't offer an explanation. Parker gave his condolences to Allan over her father's arrest and learned she was moving to \nOregon\n, as Adrian did not want his family to see his trial. Allan said goodbye to Parker and expressed her hope that he could sort out his life, leaving him saddened at her departure.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker rejoins the Decathlon team yet again\n \n \nIn the academic decathlon meeting, \nRoger Harrington\n presented the team with their trophy from the \nWashington, D.C.\n Nationals, with the group giving a big round of applause for their victory. However, due to Allan moving away, Harrington noted that they now needed a new team leader and revealed that she would be succeeded by \nMichelle Jones\n, much to everyone's approval, including Parker's. A thankful Jones mentioned that she preferred her friends to call her \"MJ.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being questioned by \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nDuring practice, Parker got a text from \nHappy Hogan\n to meet in the bathroom for a private conversation. Upon reading this, Parker then excused himself from their Decathlon team meeting. Just as he prepared to leave though, Jones questioned where Parker was going and what he was hiding. Parker was momentarily nervous that Jones suspected the truth, only for her to then jokingly claim that she actually didn't care about his life, much to his relief.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker having a meeting with \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nMeeting Hogan in the bathroom as requested, Parker then listened as Hogan apologized for ignoring his calls and not treating him seriously. Hogan also thanked Parker for saving the \nStark Cargo Plane\n from Vulture, noting that if it was not for Spider-Man he might have lost his job at \nStark Industries\n. They were interrupted by \nTiny McKeever\n using the toilet, leading to an awkward moment before Hogan explained that \nTony Stark\n now wanted to speak with Parker upstate.\n[\n4\n]\nRejecting the Avengers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker arrives at the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"I'd rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?\"\n\"You're turning me down?

There, \nHappy Hogan\n brought Parker to meet with \nTony Stark\n who was waiting for him, with Stark then requesting a private talk with Parker, only for Hogan to still insisting on staying close by them regardless.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker has another meeting with \nTony Stark\n \n \nAs they then began walking together, Stark had apologized for taking away Parker's \nSpider-Man Suit\n though added that he had it coming following the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n and the fallout of that, claiming that it was the perfect tough love moment that Parker had needed. Stark then admitted that he was wrong about Parker's capabilities and that he was worthy to join the \nAvengers\n, which Stark had known had always been the ultimate dream for Parker.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is presented a new \nIron Spider Armor\n \n \nNoting that there were fifty reporters who were still waiting for them, Stark then proudly displayed a new \nIron Spider Armor\n for Parker to put on. He then told him that if Parker was ready, he would introduce all the world to the newest member of the Avengers, Spider-Man. While Parker was excited at the prospect of joining the Avengers and working with his mentor, his conflict with \nVulture\n had given him a newfound maturity.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker chooses to reject \nTony Stark\n's offer\n \n \nWhile Stark had begun explaining how Parker becoming an Avenger would work, noting he would stay next door to \nVision\n, Parker, however, knowing that he had more to learn before he was ready to join the Avengers, politely declined Stark's offer and simply stated that he preferred to stay on the ground for the time of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, staying within \nNew York City\n helping the people in need, much to the considerable surprise of Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker leaving the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \nHis mentor respected his decision and agreed to let Parker go back to New York, with Hogan telling him to wait in the car while he had a private word with Stark while Parker was gone. As Parker was about to leave, he turned and asked if this was simply a secret test of his character and that there were not really fifty reporters waiting for him to be announced as the latest member of the Avengers, as Stark had replied that it was and he passed, leaving Parker to walk away.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker finds the \nSpider-Man Suit\n in his room\n \n \nUnknown to Parker, Stark was serious about his desire to add Spider-Man to the Avengers, leaving \nPepper Potts\n and Stark to instead tell the reports that they had been invited to announce their engagement, as Hogan gave Stark the ring, he had been carrying with him for years. Once he returned home to the \nParker Residence\n, Parker then discovered that Stark had returned his second suit, leaving it in a bag on Parker's bed with a note saying that it belonged to him. Excited at the prospect of finally returning onto the streets and protecting the people of New York City from criminals, Spider-Man put on the suit again, ready to resume his heroics.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man being discovered by \nAunt May\n \n \nUnbeknownst to him at first, however, \nAunt May\n saw him putting on the suit, watching in Parker's doorway as he had pulled off his mask and then loudly cursing as she questioned what was going on, much to Parker's utter shock and horror as he now had no way of explaining this.\n[\n4\n]\n Parker would inform his aunt of his duel identity, and she came to accept it, even supporting his work as Spider-Man.\n[\n3\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker taking a photo with \nTony Stark\n \n \nDespite Parker not having an actual \nStark Industries\n internship and simply using it as a reason to excuse his absence when operating as Spider-Man, Stark officially offered one to him.

Spotting the appearance of an \nalien warship\n hovering over \nNew York City\n, Parker decided to respond to the potential threat.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man heading over into \nNew York City\n \n \nLooking around the bus and deciding to investigate, Parker quickly asked \nNed Leeds\n to create a distraction for him. Leeds spotted the Q-Ship out Parker's window and began to panic loudly as all the other students look over their windows to see at what was going on. The distraction worked and Parker equipped his \nWeb-Shooters\n and leave through an emergency escape hatch. Parker booted up his \nSpider-Man Suit\n to conceal his identity and swung off the bridge to head to the conflict and figure out what was actually going on in the city.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man arrives in time to save \nIron Man\n \n \nQuickly arriving in Greenwich Village, Spider-Man arrived just in time to catch a blow from \nCull Obsidian\n's \nhammer\n aimed at \nIron Man\n and greeted him with an uplifting remark. However, Obsidian quickly grabbed Spider-Man and threw him across the park he had found Stark in. \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nCull Obsidian\n \n \nAs Iron Man continued to fight, Spider-Man got up from the ground and joined him in battle, questioning him about what the alien's problem was, Iron Man responded by telling him that Obsidian was \"from space and wanted a \nnecklace\n from a wizard.\" As he leaped onto Obsidian, Spider-Man was caught by his hammer and was thrown again. Iron Man and Spider-Man tried to fight against Obsidian but suffered from some trouble subduing him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man chases \nEbony Maw\n in the city\n \n \nInterrupted, Spider-Man noticed \nEbony Maw\n levitating across the city with \nDoctor Strange\n. After Iron Man told him to save Doctor Strange, Spider-Man pursued towards Maw, web-swinging across the city, but was hurt by Maw's use of his power by telekinetically using a billboard to throw at him. Spider-Man quickly recovered and followed Maw, managing to shoot his web and pulled Strange from the air, swinging away from Maw before he could catch him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to rescue \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nSwinging around the city with an unconscious Doctor Strange, Spider-Man had pulled away when the \nQ-Ship\n used its gravitational pull. Spider-Man used his best effort to rescue the sorcerer by using a lamp post to hold on and used his strength to stay put. Spider-Man was cut off-guard when Ebony Maw telekinetically pulled him away from the lamp post and was subsequently pulled toward the alien warship. Spider-Man was unable to retrieve Strange and called upon Iron Man that he was getting himself in a difficult situation. Spider-Man was stuck at the warship and managed to crawl up at the side of the ring.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man climbs onto the \nQ-Ship\n \n \nAfter finishing his battle, Iron Man managed to locate the Q-Ship and fly towards the sky, contacting Spider-Man to stay put and, and he deployed the \nItem 17A\n from the \nAvengers Compound\n. Beginning to run out of oxygen, Spider-Man removed his mask as he was unable to breathe as much as he could. Spider-Man told Iron Man that he must save the wizard as he was told by him, but Iron Man retorted his statement that he would not be able to breathe as the ship moved upward.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is given the \nIron Spider Armor\n \n \nAs he exhaustively started to pass out, Spider-Man was nearly suffocated as the ship left Earth's atmosphere and fell off the ship as he could not breathe anymore. Falling down, Spider-Man was rescued by the intervention of Iron Man, who summoned the Iron Spider Armor. As the suit manifested around him with nanotech particles, Spider-Man swiftly recovered with an acrobatic landing and was able to breathe and contact Iron Man, telling him that his new suit smelled like a new car.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man enters inside the \nQ-Ship\n \n \nAs Iron Man flew above him, Spider-Man was taken away as he was told, letting \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n quickly deploy his parachute from the back. Spider-Man angrily shouted as the parachute took him away from the ship. Spider-Man webbed at the side of the Q-Ship and intensely held onto it. Spider-Man then attached himself to the wall of the ship and entered inside of a vault. As the vault closed, Spider-Man contemplated whether he should have stayed on the bus.\n[\n8\n]\nRescue of Doctor Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man meets up with \nTony Stark\n \n \n\"You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.\"\nSpider-Man to \nIron Man\n[src]\nAs the \nQ-Ship\n made its way to the planet of \nTitan\n, Spider-Man spotted \nIron Man\n and the \nCloak of Levitation\n at the rendezvous point of the ship. Iron Man was quickly startled as Parker unmasked himself and tried to calm him down knowing what he was going to say. Stark was furious with Parker for following him through the ship, as the young hero attempted to explain himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker explains his reasoning to \nTony Stark\n \n \nRetracting his statement, Parker stated that it was a long way down from home and his suit was incredibly intuitive. Putting in technical terms, Parker said that it was mostly Stark's fault for letting him on the ship. Stark angrily asked him to retract his statement which Parker took back what he said. Parker had to tell him that he should stay with him, but Stark had to tell him that he needed to think his situation, to which Parker retracted, saying he did think his plan through.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man plans to rescue \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nTrying to be reasonable, Parker told Stark that you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. As Stark was stunned by his logic, Parker said that while his analogy didn't make sense, he was able to convince Stark to let him stay with him. After Stark agreed, Spider-Man walked over the edge and was asked to make himself useful and decided on how to rescue \nDoctor Strange\n below. After a moment of thinking, Parker came up with a strategy to save Strange, which was inspired by the movie \nAliens\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to rescue \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nOnce Strange was further tortured, Spider-Man waited as Stark quietly went behind \nEbony Maw\n to distract and surprise him, destroying the hull of the ship that can suck into the vacuum of space, leaving Maw to be subsequently killed. Noticing Strange being pulled away, Spider-Man narrowly managed to shoot a web at Strange and reached over a pole, aggressively hanging onto it. However, once the pole broke off, Spider-Man quickly fell down towards the hole.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man greets the \nCloak of Levitation\n \n \nSuddenly, Spider-Man unexpectedly activated his new suit's spider legs and managed to hang off from the hole on the ship. Spider-Man happily saved Strange from near death. As he was hanging on, Spider-Man looked at his newfound spider legs in question. Spider-Man pulled Strange inside the ship, jumping upward with his spider legs, long enough for Iron Man to seal it. After reviving the sorcerer, Parker gave greeting to the Cloak of Levitation with a handshake to which it goes away, leaving Parker to sarcastically leave it be.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries greeting \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nStrange argued with Stark for nearly putting his life at risk. As they argued Stark contracted that he saved him in a ship with no backup, Parker then recalled himself to be back up. Stark disagreed and told him that he was a stowaway. Strange wondered if Parker was Stark's ward, but Parker clarified that he was not, and introduced himself to Doctor Strange, who returned the gesture; however, Parker mistook Strange's proper title for his superhero name.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is declared an \nAvenger\n by \nTony Stark\n \n \nSlowly walking towards the ship and listening to the conversation, Parker watched as Stark and Strange discussed and argued about how to confront their enemy, \nThanos\n. After debating on what they should take into consideration, Strange reluctantly agreed to help confront Thanos. As Stark walked in front of him, Parker was formally knighted by him and was officially declared as a member of the \nAvengers\n, much to his delight.\n[\n8\n]\nMeeting the Guardians\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to pilot the \nQ-Ship\n \n \n\"I'm \nhere\n to kill \nThanos\n.

Parker tried to turn the ship around from deserted buildings but ended up crashing into them. \nDoctor Strange\n protected Parker and Stark from crash-landing the ship, by \nshielding\n them through holographic \nTao Mandalas\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker warns \nIron Man\n and \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nAfter crash-landing the Q-Ship, Parker appeared upside down before Strange and Stark and told them that if an alien implanted eggs in his chest and he ate one of them, he was sorry. Stark angrily told him to never say anything pop culture related and to stop talking, leading Parker to state that he was trying to tell them that something was coming at them.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries fighting against \nPeter Quill\n \n \nThey were then attacked by a group of \naliens\n and a bomb was detonated in front of them, in which they quickly moved out of the way. Parker was then startled by \nMantis\n, who tried to get near him to put him to sleep with her powers, and \nwebbed\n her up in fear of her planting eggs in him. Parker tried to get away but was attacked by \nPeter Quill\n. Dodging away, Parker avoided the many lasers that were shot at by Quill's \nQuad Blasters\n and attempted to attack him with his \nIron Spider\n legs, but was subdued by the \nelectrical bolas\n that vigorously shocked him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nStar-Lord\n they are the \nAvengers\n \n \nAs the brief scuffle ended at a stalemate, Parker was held at gunpoint by Quill. Stark captured and pinned down \nDrax the Destroyer\n after. Quill then threatened to kill Parker and asked Stark where \nGamora\n was, to which Stark replied that he had no idea who he was talking about. Strange then asked what master they served, wondering if they worked for \nThanos\n. Quill told them they did not work for Thanos, but wanted to kill him, and then asked who they were. Parker replied that they were the \nAvengers\n and Mantis recognized the name, mentioning \nThor\n. Stark asked if they knew Thor and Quill said they did and that he was not good-looking, something that Parker disagreed with.\n[\n8\n]\nMaking a Plan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker questioning \nStar-Lord\n's team\n \n \n\"Like in \nFootloose\n, the movie?\"\n\"Exactly like \nFootloose\n!

As Stark tried to come up with a plan to stop \nThanos\n, Drax yawned in interruption, which irritated Stark. Star-Lord explained that listening was not what they would do, and Parker questioned what exactly the Guardians would do. Mantis explained what they would do in a comprehensive statement, leaving both Parker and Stark completely dumbfounded.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker questions \nStar-Lord\n about \nFootloose\n \n \nStark told Star-Lord to get his team together and as they were trying to come up with a plan, Star-Lord wanted to come up with a different plan, to which Drax brought up the time he saved the galaxy with a dance-off. Parker wondered if it was like the movie \nFootloose\n and Star-Lord was thoroughly happy to say that it was. Star-Lord asked Parker if the film was the greatest movie back on \nEarth\n, but Parker told him that it never was.\n[\n8\n]\nBattle of Titan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man hides to surprise attack \nThanos\n \n \n\"\nMagic\n!

Strange revealed that he had used the \nTime Stone\n to \nsee into the future\n to find a way for them to win; revealing to Stark that despite the extreme number of ways they would lose, there was a single timeline in which they were successful. Eventually, \nThanos\n arrived and revealed to Strange that \nTitan\n was his homeworld.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attacks \nThanos\n multiple times\n \n \nAs Spider-Man and the rest of his allies sneaked up on Thanos, a \nfierce battle\n ensued, as Spider-Man launched \nwebbing\n into Thanos' face and then struck him in the face. Strange covered Thanos' hand with the \nCloak of Levitation\n and used his \nEldritch Magic\n to open \nportals\n for Spider-Man to attack him repeatedly: However, Thanos quickly immobilized Spider-Man and, angered by the provocations, threw him at Strange and the two fell onto the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man almost takes \nThanos\n' \nGauntlet\n \n \nShortly, Spider-Man and his allies were joined by \nNebula\n and were able to subdue Thanos. Iron Man told him to help him remove the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n. While Thanos was pinned down, the alliance nearly succeeded until Nebula deduced that her \nsister\n had \ndied\n, which caused Quill to become angry. Quill attacked Thanos and ruined Mantis' control, just as Spider-Man nearly pulled the Gauntlet out of Thanos' hand.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man manages to rescue \nMantis\n \n \nThanos regained control, pulled the Gauntlet back and tossed Mantis away. Spider-Man noticed her being flung across and rescued her. Thanos then proceeded to attack the rest of the alliance by throwing debris from a nearby moon, crashing it towards Titan. Spider-Man swung around the fallen meteors from the moon while holding onto Mantis, avoiding the many fiery ballistic inbound, random debris, and massive pillars that were floating in any possible direction.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man saves all of the \nGuardians\n' lives\n \n \nSwinging onto a still pillar, Spider-Man managed to web up Mantis to safety and swiftly saved Quill, Nebula and Drax, as they were falling uncontrollably, webbing across there locality and attach them up to a cliff. As he was talking, Spider-Man became flustered with himself that he could not remember any of the \nGuardians\n' names, before setting them down safely.\n[\n8\n]\nThanos' Victory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker helping \nTony Stark\n off the ground\n \n \n\"Mr. Stark?

Standing over Stark, Parker helped him by lifting him so that he could stand up on his feet after he suffered from his injuries in a gruesome duel with the Mad Titan.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker begins \nsensing\n his upcoming demise\n \n \nOnce Thanos completed the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n and snapped his fingers, Parker watched his allies on Titan disintegrate into ashes, firstly appointing towards the Guardians of the Galaxy members. Talking to Stark, Strange spoke on behalf of him, saying there was no other way that he could have ultimately saved the universe. Starting to feel weaker, Parker spoke to Stark, as he turned around to see what had happened.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker dies as a victim of the \nSnap\n \n \nWalking slowly, Parker muttered Stark's surname and said that he did not feel so good and realized that he was almost fading away. Terrified, Parker did not understand what was happening and clutched onto Stark. Parker was sadly tearing up and told Stark that he didn't want to die. Visibly shocked, Stark stayed by Parker's side but was helpless as Parker muttered one final apology before \ndisintegrating into dust\n.\n[\n8\n]\nBattle of Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man returns to fight against \nThanos\n \n \n\"Do you remember when we were in space?

Parker joined the \nAvengers\n and stood behind \nSteve Rogers\n as he gave the rallying cry.

After \nScott Lang\n, in Giant form, crushed Obsidian with his enlarged foot, Parker removed his mask and helped Stark stand up on his feet. Parker told Stark about turning into dust before passing out, further noting that Strange was there with him and began to wake him up to tell the rest that they need him. While talking, he was taken by surprise when Stark hugged him and returned the hug while commenting that it felt nice.\n[\n23\n]\nProtecting the Gauntlet\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man protecting the \nNano Gauntlet\n \n \n\"Hi.

Black Panther then threw it up and Spider-Man shot a \nweb\n strand at it. Once Spider-Man had taken the Nano Gauntlet and landed onto an \nOutrider\n, he then activated 'Instant Kill' mode to impale countless Outriders. Despite defeating many Outriders, Spider-Man had a hard time handling them in packs, knowing he did not have much leverage against them.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man navigates through the battle\n \n \nAfter Spider-Man called for assistance, \nCaptain America\n noticed the Outriders attacking him and hurled \nMjlnir\n at Parker, who hung onto the hammer with a web strand, but he began to fall when a shot from the \nSanctuary II\n, which \nalternate Thanos\n had ordered to rain fire, severed the web strand. \nPepper Potts\n, who was wearing her \nMark XLIX Armor\n, caught him and dropped him off onto \nValkyrie\n's steed, \nWarsong\n. Parker attempted to introduce himself to Valkyrie, but a shot from the \nSanctuary II\n threw him off the steed and onto the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is introduced to \nCaptain Marvel\n \n \nSpider-Man then tried to run away from the upcoming fire, but was interrupted with a blast, sending him flying across the field.

Parker told Leeds that he has some errands to run such as buying mini toothpaste, pick up his passport, and finally take down the \nManfredi Crime Family\n. As Leeds looked concerned, Parker told him that he is fine on his running errands on his own.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asking \nDelmar\n for dual headphones\n \n \nEntering inside \nDelmar's Deli & Grill\n to buy his travel gear, Parker was asked by Mister \nDelmar\n about his trip and was told if he could come. Parker told Delmar that it was a science trip, leading Delmar to be uninterested. As Parker went to the counter, he asked Delmar about giving a dual headphone adapter in Spanish, but Delmar was confused on mispronunciation. Parker bought the headphones and started to go to a pawn shop.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sells his toys to a pawn shop owner\n \n \nWhile selling his toys at a pawn shop, Parker was told about if he's sure about selling them, to which he was sure enough and admitted that he wanted to buy a gift for a \ngirl\n that he likes, having the owner to tell him that he hopes that she was worth it. Before leaving the shop, Parker asked for the \nLobot\n toy back and kept it. Parker traveled to the \nUnited States Postal Service\n to get his passport, only to confront a long line of people waiting inside the room.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asking a worker for his passport\n \n \nGetting impatient in the long line, Parker decides to use his phone to call up his \nSpider-Drone\n from his backpack and help him find a new spot to wait online. Parker waited for the Spider-Drone, as it climbed onto another pickup line and pressed a button to activate its opening. After successfully pulling off another lane and getting back his drone, Parker asked a lady for passport to pick up, despite her eating a sandwich.\n[\n24\n]\nAttack on the Manfredi Crime Family\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fights the \nManfredi Syndicate\n \n \n\"Guys, guys, I just wanted dressing on the side!

That's it, I'm definitely not giving you a 20% tip!\"\nSpider-Man\n[src]\nAfter finishing up his own errands before leaving for \nEurope\n, Spider-Man suited up his \nIron Spider Armor\n before entering an upper-class restaurant that was controlled by the \nManfredi Crime Family\n. Putting an end to the \nMafia Cold War\n, Spider-Man began to engage in battle in order to get them arrested for good.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man webs the \nManfredi Syndicate\n \n \nSpider-Man defeated a couple of criminals by snaring them with his \nSynthetic Webbing\n and dropping them onto the ground. Spider-Man lands onto a table and used his web-grenade to trap another goon from aiming his gun at him. Spider-Man then back-flipped off the table and shot his webbing at numerous goons as he jumped away from gunfire. As the webbing had been fired off to trap the goons onto walls and ceilings, Spider-Man sat down onto a table in awe from it.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man pursues fighting the criminals\n \n \nSpider-Man suddenly noticed a Manfredi goon shooting at him with his assault rifle and was being shot at with a number of bullets onto, dropping down from the impact from them. While the goon was reloading, Spider-Man told the goon that his suit was bulletproof and pulled himself with his webs and drop kick him in the face. Spider-Man noticed a goon hiding and was reaching for a gun on the floor until he webbed the goon up onto a ceiling.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attacks criminals with his \nsuit\n \n \nThe rest of the Crime Family ran towards Spider-Man after defeating many of their members and attacked him. Spider-Man punched a goon in the face and evade one of the goons' attacks until he used a red bell pepper to beat one of them up. Spider-Man activated his iron spider-legs and attacked a goon from behind after disarming his kitchen knife. Spider-Man clashed with two of the goon's knives and stopped a goon from attacking him with a fire extinguisher.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man defeats the \nManfredi Mob\n \n \nAfter puncturing a fire extinguisher from a goon attacking him from behind, Spider-Man attacked all of his surrounding goons, defeating all of them with one quick swing from his iron spider-legs. As the fire extinguisher was set off, Spider-Man waves off the fumes and closed a cracked fish tank with his webs before the \nNew York City Police Department\n had arrived. Once they came to the restaurant, Spider-Man told the police about the situation.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man talking about the crime scene\n \n \nSpider-Man spoke to one of the police officers that were reporting the crime scene, telling her which ones were the runner, the buyer, the seller, and the snitch before the latter goon was mortified by the blame. Spider-Man apologized to the goon for blowing his cover and advised Officer \nBristow\n to incarcerate the snitch in his own cell. Bristow then asked Spider-Man if he's going to be the next \nIron Man\n but he sarcastically told him that he can't because he's too busy doing the police's jobs.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man proudly declaring his vacation\n \n \nAs the whole group of police officers laughed at Bristow's embarrassment from being talked down upon, Spider-Man told them that he was only kidding but seriously talked to them about doing their jobs this time, noting he will go on vacation. Spider-Man then walked away from the restaurant and let the police do their jobs before declining Bristow's offer to give a selfie, promising to do so next time on his superhero activities.\n[\n24\n]\nPressure from the Public\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man showing his support to \nQueens\n \n \n\"If the \naliens\n come back, what are you gonna do?\"\n\"Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?\"\n\nReporter\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nAttending at a homeless support shelter at \nUrban Sports & Cultural Center\n that was hosted by \nMay Parker\n, Spider-Man suited up for his stage performance with his \nIron Spider Armor\n for people who had been displaced and become homeless after the \nBlip\n. After May shared her story of being blipped back into existences, she then introduced Spider-Man up on the stage to speak to them. Spider-Man stiffly thanked May for having him, as well as the audience that came to meet him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker congratulating \nMay\n for her speech\n \n \nSpider-Man walked away from the stage after May told the audience to hangout before he comes back to take photos and videos of him. Spider-Man unmasked himself and high-fived May for her speech. Parker told May that she did well but was criticized by her for being stiff when spoke, agreeing with her. May changed the subject by asking Parker if he packed his passport and mini toothbrush, to which he said that he did indeed.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being confused of \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nParker and May witnessed \nHappy Hogan\n with a check and immediately introduced to himself to May. Parker suddenly noticed Hogan flirting with May by asking her about the new dress and talked about his new beard. Once May had got the check from \nPepper Potts\n, she told Parker go to the public and meet them. Parker looked at Hogan and asked what happened, but Hogan ignored his question and told him that \nNick Fury\n is calling him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gets a phone call from \nNick Fury\n \n \nParker asked Hogan about why Fury would try to contact him, being told that he calls superheroes for any activities. Parker told Hogan that he probably would call someone else not him until his had started ringing. Picking up his phone, Parker was told that was Fury calling him, but he reluctantly refused to speak to him, but was told to answer the phone or else Hogan will have to. Parker asked Hogan about not answering it himself, being told that he was scared and was told to pick up the phone.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker refuses to answer \nNick Fury\n's call\n \n \nParker looked up to Hogan and chose to send Fury to voicemail, causing Hogan to freak out towards him ghosting Fury so casually. Parker noticed the crowd of people calling him backstage and told Hogan that he has to go. As Parker walked back and his iron spider-legs opened the curtains, he promised Hogan that he'll call Fury later on, walking away in promise to call him after his school trip. Parker masked himself up and was greeted by the many news reporters.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is overwhelmed by the public\n \n \nAs a swarm of reporters demanded to ask Spider-Man questions, he would pick a reporter who asked if he was head \nAvenger\n, saying no to that question. Spider-Man picked another reporter who asked what he would do if the \naliens\n would return, rejecting that question. Spider-Man picked another reporter who asked if he's the next \nIron Man\n which overwhelmed Spider-Man with extensive amount of anxiety, causing him to abruptly jump away and left the building.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker looking sadly at a tribute to \nIron Man\n \n \nSpider-Man web-swung up to the building and landed onto the roof, unmasking himself to catch his breath. As Parker calmed himself from all the serious questions he was asked, he got another phone call from Fury but he quickly dismissed it. When Parker overlooked the view of the city, he saw a graffiti memorial to his deceased mentor that he found difficult to look at, grappling with whether or not he could live up to Iron Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker packing up for his trip to \nEurope\n \n \nLater while starting to pack up his clothes for the trip, Parker received a phone call from Fury but kept ignoring him. Parker then saw his \nSpider-Man Suit\n, wondering if he should bring it with or not. Before making a choice, Parker was hit by a banana by May, apologizing to him by telling him that she thought he could dodge that. After May questioned Parker about his \"\nPeter Tingle\n,\" Parker told her to not call it that and that he really needs this vacation for his summer break.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker leaves his \nsuit\n and \narmor\n behind\n \n \nAfter getting hugged by May, Parker was told to pack his suit just in case, jokingly by saying she has a tingle about it. Parker looked back on his suit and chose to leave it behind his closet, even looking down on his \nIron Spider Armor\n in a chamber and still chose to leave alone, so that he could enjoy his field trip without having to worry about superhero responsibilities. However, May would later pack his suit herself without his knowledge.\n[\n3\n]\nFlying to Europe\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker goes on board the plane to \nEurope\n \n \n\"I need your help to sit next to \nMJ\n.\"\n\"Seriously?\"\n\"Yes, seriously.\"\n\"What about all our plan? \nAmerican\n bachelors in \nEurope\n!\"\nPeter Parker and \nNed Leeds\n[src]\nOn the plane to \nEurope\n, Parker was happily excited for the trip, overlooking the view before leaving \nNew York City\n. Sitting next to \nNed Leeds\n on the plane, Parker was told by \nFlash Thompson\n about what an airplane is, making fun of the fact that he was poor enough to get the trains instead of the bus.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is talked down by \nFlash Thompson\n \n \nAfter Parker was being made fun by Thompson as he was holding a glass of champagne, \nMichelle Jones\n took note of this and told the flight attendant that Thompson was a victim to the \nBlip\n, making him underage to drink. Parker laughed at Thompson once his drink was taken away while also being told by \nBrad Davis\n how funny Jones was for doing that. Parker listened Leeds as he was surprised that all girls are after him once they were back from the dead.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sees \nBrad Davis\n with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nParker was then worried at the prospect that Davis would make a move on Jones as he noticed him helping Jones with luggage. After Leeds told Parker about the nine-hour flight will take a while and that they should play \nBeast Slayers\n at that time, Parker tried to convince Leeds to help him sit next to Jones despite of his reluctance to do it since he wanted to become a bachelor with Parker, but soon he managed to get Leeds to help him go with his plan. Once Leeds went with the Parker's plan, he went over to Jones and \nBetty Brant\n and told them about Parker's fake allergy to perfume from an old lady sitting right in front of where there were sitting at.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sees \nRoger Harrington\n's involvement\n \n \nAs \nRoger Harrington\n noticed the commotion of Parker's perfume allergy, he decided to take action and help Parker to sit right next to him for safety. Parker noticed the change that Harrington was putting through his classmates, having Leeds be beside Brant and Jones beside Davis. Parker picked up his backpack and moved down his seat next to Harrington, being informed that his teacher has a very small bladder.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker keeps an eye on MJ with Davis\n \n \nAfter taking his own seat, Parker was forced to talk to Harrington and listened to his story about his wife who died when the Blip had started but it turned out she ran off with her hiking group. As the flight to \nVenice\n was taking off for hours, Parker kept checking on Jones and Davis to see if they were getting too close, making himself mad for ruining the plan. Parker tried to find a movie to calm down but ended to finding \nHeart of Iron: The Tony Stark Story\n, causing him to stop himself from doing anything else.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker preparing to meet \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAs the flight attendance hat notified the passengers to got to the restroom, Parker decided to go over to it so that he could take a break. While washing his hands, Parker opened only to see Jones in front of him, causing him to move away and go into the bathroom. After trying to get ready to look and pretend to use the bathroom, Parker brushed off look presentable and opened the door, only to find Davis waiting to use the bathroom, much to his disappointment.\n[\n3\n]\nEncountering Hydro-Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker discovers \nLeeds\n' new relationship\n \n \n\"I left my \nsuit\n in the hotel room.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because I'm on vacation, Ned!

After being told that it was probably nothing, Parker discovered Leeds and \nBetty Brant\n were now in a relationship and asked Leeds what happened to being a bachelor in \nEurope\n, noting that he was too grownup for that.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is checked by security staff in \nVenice\n \n \nParker carried his luggage out into the scanner and off to the exit, only for one of the guard dogs to smell something off with his briefcase. Now having to showcase the security for his luggage, Parker attempted to tell the guard that nothing important was in there. The security lady unzipped the case, to which saw his \nSpider-Man Suit\n with a sticky note left in by \nMay\n. Parker looked around nervously, only for the guard to tell them that no bananas were allowed.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker arrives with his classmates in \nVenice\n \n \nAfter catching up to his classmates at the airport, Parker joined them on a sailboat in \nVenice\n, looking around the city landscape and even checking Jones out if she was having a good time. As the boat stopped by at \nHotel DeMatteis\n, Parker and his classmates settle down their luggage into their rooms before being told by \nJulius Dell\n to meet up at the \nDa Vinci Museum\n later on at noon. Parker and his classmates left the hotel and decided to hang around the city.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker looking at \nMichelle Jones\n in \nVenice\n \n \nAs the rest of his classmates were off with their activities, Parker noticed Jones hanging out with Davis as they take photographs of the trip, becoming jealous of how close they were in Venice. As part of his plan to confess his feelings, Parker looked around the city to find a shop that sells jewelry and found a Black Dalia necklace. After buying the necklace, Parker bumped into Jones and walked with each other, talking the phrase with Boh in Italian.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker \nsenses\n something wrong\n \n \nAfter Jones rejected flowers from one of the keepers, Parker was asked what was in the shopping bag, to which he responded by saying Boh, having her to accept it. The pair walked by the canals noticing a large number of crabs scrambling out of the water and Parker \nsensed\n something wrong, as he noticed a water drain behaving strangely. Seconds later, \nHydro-Man\n burst out of the canal crashing a gondola that Leeds and Brant were in.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks \nNed Leeds\n to get out of the way\n \n \nParker helped get his classmates get out of the boat and saw Hydro-Man rise up from the water. Parker told Leeds to leave with his friends before telling him that he doesn't have his suit. After escorting people out of the way, Parker evaded Hydro-Man's attacks and equipped himself with \nWeb-Shooters\n behind a wall. Parker attempted to shoot webbing at the creature, but it passed straight through with no effect, much to his disappointment.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker leaps to save the civilians of \nVenice\n \n \nNoticing a bridge full of people in harm's way, Parker leaped on several wooden poles, grabbed on a paddle to hoist up in the air from a cruiser, and landed onto the bridge. Parker helped clear people out of the way before being punched backward by Hydro-Man's attack into the bridge rail. Recovering from the knockback, Parker then witnessed \nMysterio\n flying in to fight the Elemental with his magical powers, much to his surprise.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker witnessing \nMysterio\n's sudden arrival\n \n \nAfter seeing Mysterio in the air, Parker looked around and saw a carnival mask on the ground, putting it on to conceal his identity. While Mysterio was battling Hydro-Man with sheer force, Parker yelled at the new superhero by saying he could help and that he was very strong and sticky. Mysterio told Parker to lead the Elemental away from the \nGrand Canal\n, as he flew away from the scene and Elemental went charging at him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks \nMysterio\n if he could help\n \n \nAfter listening to Mysterio's advice, Parker back-flipped away from the rooftop and saw him and Hydro-Man following him. Parker swung up on a rooftop of a building and witnessed the chase between Mysterio and Hydro-Man having to cause all of the destruction within the building structure. Parker aided the civilians by swinging across the city keeping rubble off the fleeing people in the streets below.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker swings into action to save a building\n \n \nAfter using his Web-Shooters to keep the rubble from the buildings off from the ground and webbed all of the walls from falling, Parker then witnessed Hydro-Man reaching into the plaza and fighting Mysterio. Parker took into action and swung up to a church building, closing any cracks on walls with his webbing. Parker went up the church-bell roof and saw Hydro-Man destroying a part of the building, causing to worry Parker.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker stops a building from falling down\n \n \nUsing two buildings nearby for lifting, Parker used his webbing to hold on to them and keep the church building away from crushing his classmates from the ground below. As Mysterio's battle became intense, Parker was hit by the bell in face and began to lose grip with one of the strings of web, casing another hit to face from the church bell. Parker webbed up buildings again and hold on tightly as the building was about to fall down.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is relieved his necklace isn't broken\n \n \nAs Parker struggled to keep the building away and onto the ground, the battle was soon ending as Mysterio had finally killed Hydro-Man with his powers. Parker felt the impact of the water splashing and caused him to lose grip, letting the building collapse into the ground. Parker quickly recovered from the destruction and checked if his Black Dahlia necklace was safe, relieved that it wasn't broken from the battle.\n[\n3\n]\nMeeting Nick Fury\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker answers his phone from his \naunt\n \n \n\"This all seems like big-time, you know, huge superhero kind of stuff and, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.\"\n\"Bitch, please. You've been to space.\"\n\"I know, but that was an accident.\"\nPeter Parker and \nNick Fury\n[src]\nBack at the \nHotel DeMatteis\n where the class was staying, Parker answered the call from \nMay\n and talked about the incident at \nVenice\n. Parker told May that he wanted to stay on the trip and was noted that she was glad to pack his \nSpider-Man Suit\n. Being asked about the \nmysterious superhero\n, Parker told May that he did not know him at all, and corrected her about confusing him for another \nmagic based hero\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker greets \nHogan\n back at \nNew York\n \n \nParker listened closely to May telling \nHappy Hogan\n to not eat her lunch, being confused in what was happening. May told Parker he came to check up on her and that he wanted to greet him, making him oddly suspicious of Hogan. After the awkward phone call, Parker was asked about the plan on confessing his feelings to \nMichelle Jones\n, responding to May that there were setbacks and later hanged up the phone.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks to \nMichelle Jones\n about \nParis\n \n \nThe news had dubbed the superhero from the incident as the \"Man of Mystery,\" also known as the Mysterio. \nFlash Thompson\n admitted that Mysterio was incomparable to Spider-Man, before Parker listened to this and was ruthlessly insulted. Parker asked Jones if she seen anything from incident, being told that she just ran away. Parker agreed that he also running as well and was excited for the next trip to \nParis\n, to which Jones told him that the \nEiffel Tower\n was her favorite place.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being surprised by \nNick Fury\n's arrival\n \n \nUpstairs, Leeds asked Parker what he was going to do with \nHydro-Man\n and told him nothing, admitting that he wanted to focus on his trip and that Mysterio had handled the monster. While brushing his teeth, Parker noticed Leeds was suddenly tranquilized by \nNick Fury\n who noted that he had fed up with him for ghosting his calls. After being surprised by Fury's visit, Parker listened to Fury's explanation about a mysterious \nCyclone\n appearing at \nMorocco\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is given \nTony Stark's Glasses\n \n \nAs Fury kept on talking, the pair were interrupted by Leeds' snoring, \nRoger Harrington\n talking about if they needed anything, \nBetty Brant\n wanting to talk with Leeds, and \nJulius Dell\n. Wanting privacy, Fury took Parker to his \nhideout\n, and went along in a gondola. While riding with Fury, Spider-Man was given \nTony Stark's Glasses\n which his mentor had left for him. Spider-Man hold on to this gift before they arrived at the hideout.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is first introduced to \nMysterio\n \n \nSetting inside the hideout, Parker was told to remove the mask since everyone will know his identity. Taking off his mask, Parker was introduced to \nMaria Hill\n and \nDimitri Smerdyakov\n but was suddenly caught in sight with Mysterio. Parker uttered his name but clarified that it was a name from his friends. Beck introduced himself to Parker and shook hands, being told that he could use somebody like him on his world. Being confused, Parker was told by Fury that Beck is from a different world. Beck explained that he was from Earth-833, causing Parker to surprise at the prospect of a \nMultiverse\n existing before apologizing for getting distracted.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker listens to \nQuentin Beck\n's tragic story\n \n \nBeck further explained to Parker that the \nElementals\n were forged from outer space and comprised themselves as the elements from all worlds. Parker listened on as they explained that the Elementals were myths until they manifest themselves on Beck's earth. Parker was told that Beck's battalion tried to stop them until \none of them\n had destroyed his world and killed his loved ones. Parker was told by Fury that one entity known as fire will appear in \nPrague\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker attempting to talk out of the mission\n \n \nOnce Fury told Parker that he was going with him and his crew to Prague, he told Fury that this all seem too difficult to handle for just a 'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.' As Fury tried to justify his duty by him being in space, Parker noted that he was only there on accident and listed other superheroes to ask for help such as \nThor\n, \nDoctor Strange\n and \nCaptain Marvel\n but was told that all of them were off-world or unavailable.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being escorted back into his \nhotel\n \n \nParker told Fury that he wanted to stay on the trip to please his aunt and protect his identity so that he could not be seen in Europe or else everyone will know who he is. Fury then agreed with Parker and decided to let him go. Parker thanked Fury for the offer on the mission and was escorted back into his hotel by Smerdyakov. Parker went back to his hotel, unbeknownst of him that Fury planned to hijack his trip.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker seeing his school trip being hijacked\n \n \nThe next day, Parker checked up on Leeds to see he was fine and was told that he felt better knowing he was tranquilized by Fury. Harrington then revealed to the class that their next trip will be in \nPrague\n, telling them that they had been upgraded by the travel agency. As the Midtown group were heading to the bus, Smerdyakov posed as the driver and directed them into it. Now realizing, Parker noted to Leeds that Fury had hijacked their trip.\n[\n3\n]\nAttacked on the Highway\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker accessing \nE.D.I.T.H.\n on the tour bus\n \n \n\"Target is \nBrad Davis\n.

Parker picked up the glasses and tried them on while also picking up the card that Stark left him and read the words \n\"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\"\n Following the instructions of saying \nE.D.I.T.H.\n, Parker finds himself seeing an A.I system asking for control.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being directed into a secret hideout\n \n \nParker was introduced to E.D.I.T.H. about being an aerial defense system and able to have access to telecommunication networks. As Parker looked over to everyone's communications with their phones, he glanced over to them as nothing important until he saw \nNed Leeds\n and \nBetty Brant\n texting each other closely, much to his confusion. Once the Midtown group stopped at an Austrian rest stop, Parker was directed by \nDimitri Smerdyakov\n to secretly meet the \nSeamstress\n, promptly going with the plan. In the secret room, Parker introduced himself to the Seamstress until she told him to take off his clothes. Being confused, Parker was told that the Seamstress made his new \nStealth Suit\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gets a new suit from the \nSeamstress\n \n \nWhile still being uncomfortably awkward, Parker listened to the Seamstress' order to strip down so that he couldn't be seen. While he pulled down his pants, Parker was suddenly found by \nBrad Davis\n and despite trying to explain, he was photographed by him. Parker pulled his pants back up and stopped the Seamstress on aiming to kill Davis with her handgun. Parker went outside to meet Davis and told him that it was not what it seems but was talked down by the misunderstanding.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker orders \nE.D.I.T.H.\n to help him\n \n \nDavis clarified that he knew Parker was to get with Jones for the whole trip and that she needed to know the truth behind him. As Parker told Davis to not show that photo, he was told that Davis refused, much to his anger on the situation. Returning to the bus, Parker saw Davis on his phone, which promptly caused him to panic to pick up E.D.I.T.H. Parker told it to help him solve the problem with Davis, despite the A.I. trying to get him to speak up.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker realizes he issued the \ndrone\n strike\n \n \nAfter speaking up to explain his situation, Parker was asked if Davis is a target, answering that he is in fact a target. Once E.D.I.T.H. mistook the order for a drone strike and called it from the \nStark Industries Satellite\n, Parker realizes it was about be sent and witnessed the arrival. Parker glasses were then taken away from \nFlash Thompson\n who complimented them, but he tried to than back and accidentally knocked Thompson out with smack on his face, apologizing afterwards.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker stops the \ndrone\n strike on the bus\n \n \nParker put on the glasses again and tried to call off the drone strike against Davis only for \nZoha Souliotis\n to ask him if he punched Thompson to which he replied with denial, resulting E.D.I.T.H. to mistake it as continuing the drone strike. Parker decided to web-shoot the wheel and pull back it so that it could turn to the right. Unbeknownst of him, Parker tried to call off the drone strike again but lost the glasses to ground and quickly picked them up.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is relieved on stopping the attack\n \n \nAfter picking up the glasses, Parker was told by \nRoger Harrington\n to sit down but distracted them by telling the class to look at the baby mountain goats. While the class was distracted, Parker leaped over the bus through the skyline and webbed the drone to a rock to destroy it. Parker told the class that they missed the goats while he saw, keeping lie a secret but was told by Brant something off about him.

Parker was told that his \nStealth Suit\n had an earpiece and once he arrived at the carnival, they will be further instructions.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks about handling \nMolten Man\n \n \nAfter the phone call ended, Parker was confronted by \nNed Leeds\n, being told if that if he left out from Leeds and his relationship with \nBetty Brant\n, he should not take offense. Parker told Leeds to not worry about it and was asked on the status of the \nElemental\n attack that is about to happen, telling Leeds that he is figuring that out as they speak. Parker was told by Leeds that he and his friends are all counting on him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is lectured by \nFury\n on the situation\n \n \nParker confronted \nNick Fury\n and his crew at another hideout. After being distracted from Leeds' words on himself, Parker was yelled at Fury to focus on planning the mission out. \nMysterio\n justified the distraction by acknowledging that he kidnapped him, but Fury noted that Parker had obstacles and had to completely removed them. Being asked about the plan, Parker told the group that he will at the cathedral to keep an eye on \nMolten Man\n, contact the crew, and fight it along with Mysterio, much to Beck's correction on the name. After knowing how Molten Man will get stronger if it was contacted by metal, Parker told the crew about not putting his friends in danger.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks to \nMysterio\n on a rooftop\n \n \nParker was then berated by Fury, noting that he was not ready for this fight after knowing about using \nE.D.I.T.H.\n to call a \ndrone\n strike on one of his \nfriends\n. After being verbally yelled at, Parker sat on the roof to contemplate on the situation. Mysterio confronted Parker by making a sarcastic joke on joining him on the roof to talk by Fury's orders. Being asked how he was feeling, Parker expressed that he was planning to express his feelings to a certain \ngirl\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nMysterio\n talk about being a hero\n \n \nWith Beck sitting beside Parker, he told him that it wasn't selfish for wanting a normal life and how it was a hard path to do the right things. Parker listened to Beck about he was glad to fight a battle and knowing what's at stake, despite wanting to tell him to leave. Parker expressed that he always keeps putting his friends in danger, but Beck offered to let them be inside a place away from the battle for a few hours to keep them safe.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker orders \nE.D.I.T.H.\n to get opera tickets\n \n \nAfter Parker thanked Beck for having to talk about superhero activities, they shared a joke about once the mission was over, he will have all summer to kill Davis. Once he regained focus, Parker departed and jumped off the roof, apologizing the civilians that were startled by his entrance. Parker then used E.D.I.T.H. to place his classmates in an opera far away from the upcoming battle for a long duration to ensure their safety.\n[\n3\n]\nNight at the Opera\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker confirms \nLeeds\n to go with the plan\n \n \n\"Be careful. And Peter, whatever you do, please steer the \nmonster\n away from the opera house.\"\n\"Yeah, Ned. I know.\"\n\nNed Leeds\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nOnce Parker had gotten \nE.D.I.T.H.\n to lead his class into a safe place, he regrouped with them when \nRoger Harrington\n had an announcement. Harrington told the class that they were going to the opera, having the entire class be disappointed from the announcement. As \nNed Leeds\n looked at Parker to see if it was part of his plan, he shook his head in secret, leading to Leeds' confirmation.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker flirts with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAfter Harrington let the class dress up for the opera, Parker walked along with \nMichelle Jones\n, as \nMaria Hill\n kept barging him through his intercom from for a response. As Parker's class were taking their seats in a mostly empty opera house, Parker gave Jones a compliment about how she looked pretty; Jones joked about her appeal meaning value, flustering Parker until she admitted a reciprocating feeling about him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nNick Fury\n that he is on his way\n \n \nParker and Jones then noticed Leeds and \nBetty Brant\n discovering opera glasses, as they were ecstatic at the look of them. Parker was asked by Jones if he wanted a pair of opera glasses and sit next to each other but before Parker could answer, \nNick Fury\n called him on his hidden earpiece to move Parker into position. Parker told Jones that she could take a seat while he would get a pair of opera glasses and when she left to sit down, Parker told Fury he is on his way.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker looks on over to see \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nWhile Parker was about to leave the opera house, Parker asked Leeds to provide an alibi, telling Jones that if she asked, tell her that he was sick. Leeds then plead Parker to not let \nMolten Man\n destroy the opera house, to which Parker promised him that he already knows. As Parker was about to sneak out of the opera, he quickly glanced over to Jones until \nBrad Davis\n looked at him and gave him the middle finger, causing Parker to be angry until Fury called in for his position.\n[\n3\n]\nFighting Molten Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man watches the \nPrague\n carnival\n \n \n\"You've got to decide whether you're going to step up or not. \nStark\n chose you. He made you an \nAvenger\n. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe Stark was wrong. Was he?\"\n\nNick Fury\n to Spider-Man\n[src]\nAs the \nPrague\n carnival continued on with the celebration, Spider-Man, in his new \nStealth Suit\n perched on a high vantage point, kept an eye on the location that \nMolten Man\n was predicted to emerge. Parker landed on the ledge and contacted \nMysterio\n to keep him on alert. Parker was then asked by \nNick Fury\n about the suit, telling him that it fits great despite noting that it feels tight around the groin area.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man witnessing \nMolten Man\n \n \nAt the predicted time and location, Fury and \nMaria Hill\n had detected an energy spike that signaled the arrival of Molten Man. Upon the monster's emergence from a statue, it roared at the crowd as Spider-Man contacted the \ncrew\n that of the monster's entrance and called in Mysterio to battle it. As Molten Man started to rampage and Mysterio arrived in front of it, Spider-Man was called in and attacked it with a wooden crate, causing it to get hurt. Once Spider-Man clung onto a wall and used his \nWeb-Shooters\n to shoot at a fire hydrant, he pulled it off the ground and sprayed the water all over Molten Man while Mysterio blasted it with his powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees \nLeeds\n and \nBrant\n \n \nAfter Molten Man was attacked and started to attack Spider-Man with its fist, he evaded the attack, back-flipping away, and landed on top of a carousel. Once Molten Man destroyed the carousel and pushed Spider-Man off of it, he got up from the ground and noticed \nBetty Brant\n and \nNed Leeds\n on top of a Ferris wheel, shouting 'Night Monkey' at him. Spider-Man grew even more worried about his friends being in peril and witnessed Molten Man growing even larger.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man avoids \nMolten Man\n's attack\n \n \nSpider-Man attempted to stop Molten Man with his Web-Shooters only for the \nwebs\n to quickly burn. When all was about to end badly, Spider-Man was protected by Mysterio, as he was using his energy dome to cover each other up. While the monster kept attacking them in the dome, Mysterio asked Spider-Man to go with a strategy, to which Spider-Man noted to attack it with something it can't absorb. Mysterio prompted Spider-Man to move over to the right, as they move to the side.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man attacking \nMolten Man\n \n \nSpider-Man web-swung on top of a building as Molten Man used its powers against him, letting Spider-Man run up the wall and back-flip off of it to avoid any fires. Spider-Man used his webs to grab a piece of debris and launched it at Molten Man. Spider-Man managed to hurt the monster and while the debris was stuck inside it, he prompted Mysterio to shoot at it, causing more damage. Spider-Man landed on a top of a lamppost, being told to attack it again.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man engages in battle with \nMysterio\n \n \nSpider-Man used his webs to grab another debris of concrete and throw it at Molten Man for Mysterio to shoot at it. Once Mysterio told Spider-Man to keep Molten Man away from the Ferris wheel, he fell down during battle and witnessed the monster punching the ground as the cracks were about to reach toward the Ferris wheel. While Mysterio was attempting to keep the monster away, Spider-Man was on his way to rescue Leeds and Brant until he snagged onto an \nunseen object\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man saves \nLeeds\n and \nBrant\n \n \nAfter Spider-Man pulled off the object as it went flying over the battlefield, he looked on over to his friends and ran to save them, using his webbing to hold the Ferris wheel still and stop it from falling down. While he was keeping the Ferris wheel still, Spider-Man witnessed Mysterio turning the tide in their favor, but when a scaffolding crumbled onto Molten Man, Mysterio realized it was too large to stop it and tried to stop it with his powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees \nMysterio\n on the ground\n \n \nMysterio announced to Spider-Man that he was glad they met, leading him to ask Mysterio what he was about to do. Mysterio took a moment to use his powers to absorb its energy and flew toward Molten Man, as Spider-Man told him to not do that. Once Mysterio sacrificed himself to destroy Molten Man, Spider-Man witnessed it and settled the webbing aside to hold onto the Ferris wheel. Spider-Man saw Mysterio lying on the ground and dropped himself off the ground to inspect his survival.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is told to step up by \nNick Fury\n \n \nAs he tried to wake Beck up, Spider-Man was relieved to see him awake from his attempted sacrifice and helped Beck get back on his feet. As Fury and Hill approached the scene, Beck was requested to join the crew in \nBerlin\n, as he candidly agrees to do so. Spider-Man was then confronted by Fury and tried to reason with him until he got interrupted and was told that he would've loved to have him in Berlin as well.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is asked for a drink by \nMysterio\n \n \nSpider-Man was told by Fury that he has gifts but must decide if he's going to step up, noting that \nTony Stark\n chose him and made him part of the \nAvengers\n. Fury noted to Spider-Man that he needed an Avenger and the world as well but wasn't sure if Spider-Man was the one to be that. After Fury told Spider-Man that Stark might be wrong and left with his crew, Beck invited him for drinks at a nearby pub to cheer him up, but Spider-Man replied that he wasn't old enough to drink yet.\n[\n3\n]\nTalking with Mysterio\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talking to \nQuentin Beck\n at the pub\n \n \n\"The world needs the next \nIron Man\n, and it's not going to be me. I mean I'm a sixteen-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult, with some experience, and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.\"\nPeter Parker to \nQuentin Beck\n[src]\nRelaxing inside of the bar in \nPrague\n after fighting an intense \nbattle\n, Parker ordered a glass of lemonade and drank from it in disappointment, being hurt from \nNick Fury\n's words of discouragement. \nQuentin Beck\n cheered Parker up, telling him to celebrate his victory for what he did.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is asked about what he really wants\n \n \nParker told Beck that Fury was right, noting that \nTony Stark\n did a lot for him and he owed him big time. While Beck asked Parker if Stark really meant a lot, he told Beck that Stark gave him the chance to do more and wanted him to be better, letting Fury to hopefully keep him to live by that. Once Beck asked Parker what he wants right at this moment, he didn't think of it right away until Beck edged him on, leading him to tell Beck that he wants to go back on his trip.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nQuentin Beck\n about his needs\n \n \nParker told Beck he wanted to back on his school trip with his friends and go to the top of the \nEiffel Tower\n with the \ngirl\n that really has feelings for so that he could possibly give her a kiss. As Beck admired the detail from Parker, he told Beck to shut up about it. Beck then told Parker that he'll never do that, leading Parker to agree but Beck asked him why he should. Parker noted that he has too much of a responsibility to that kind of thing now.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker showing Beck the \nE.D.I.T.H.\n \nglasses\n \n \nWhen a waitress picked up the \nE.D.I.T.H.\n \nglasses\n from the floor and returned them to Parker, he was asked by Beck what were those and how they were just on the floor. Parker was asked to put on the glasses to see how they look, leading him to put them on and show off to Beck. As they took a moment on the look, Parker told Beck that he really likes them, but he was told that they look really stupid on him, much to his genuine disappointment.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks about \nTony Stark\n's message\n \n \nParker then begrudgingly passed them to Beck to see how they fit him, though Beck didn't really want to; he decided to pick up the glasses. Upon seeing the way they looked, Parker had thought over \nTony Stark\n's note for him and what it said; \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" After Parker told himself this, he noted to Beck that Stark gave him a message when he received the glasses, leading Beck to become in disbelief of that conclusion.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nBeck\n to keep the \nglasses\n \n \nParker told Beck that Stark knew every mistake he made so he must have known that he wasn't ready to fight battles bigger than him yet. As Beck asked why Stark would give the glasses to Parker, he told him that he was probably trusted with the power to choose Stark's successor with E.D.I.T.H. and not someone like Fury because he would just give himself the glasses. Parker emphasized that he needs to pick the next Iron Man who is an adult with experience and not himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gives \nQuentin Beck\n the \nglasses\n \n \nDespite Beck refusing to handle control over the glasses, Parker decided to put them on and tell E.D.I.T.H. to have Beck gain access over the network. With Beck asking Parker to not do it, Parker noted to him that Stark gave him the choice and wanted to do the right thing by giving it to him for saving the world. Once Parker was asked for any confirmation, he accepted the agreement and gave Beck the glasses, welcoming him to be part of the \nAvengers\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker leaves the pub to go to his trip\n \n \nHaving a moment to think, Beck ultimately accepted the glasses and shook hands with Parker, telling him that it was an honor to be a part of something. As Parker was about to leave the pub, he was told by Beck that he's partly rooting for him to get with his girl due to his sheer awkwardness. After Parker and Beck shared a chuckle, he left Beck alone and bid him farewell. With immense confidence, Parker walked out of the pub, so that he could finally enjoy his vacation.\n[\n3\n]\nLearning Mysterio's Tricks\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nNed Leeds\n his mission is over\n \n \n\"The \nElementals\n are fake? That doesn't make any sense, because we were there, right? There was fire and destruction, and... Who would do something like that?\"\n\"\nMysterio\n?\"\n\"...I am Spider-Man, and I really messed up.\"\nPeter Parker and \nMichelle Jones\n[src]\nReturning to the \nCarlo IV Hotel\n, Parker was hugged by \nNed Leeds\n in a bathrobe who informed him that their vacation had been summarily canceled, telling him that each travel destination had an Elemental attack. After Parker told Leeds that his mission was over and the \nElementals\n were gone, \nRoger Harrington\n announced them that they are leaving the trip in the morning, much to the fear of \nJulius Dell\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker awkwardly talks with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAs Leeds went to get dressed and hang out with \nBetty Brant\n, \nFlash Thompson\n told Parker to keep the noise level down while he was live streaming on his phone. Now knowing that his classmate's parents want them back, Parker was found disappointed that his plan to express his feelings to \nMichelle Jones\n was too late. Parker was then confronted by Jones on the same floor and was asked where he was, telling her that he was lost on the way back.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker watching the news in \nPrague\n \n \nAfter the two had an awkward talk about not leaving to \nParis\n, Jones closed the door on Parker, leading him to finally ready to ask her out. As he was about answer the door, Parker found Jones on edge of leaving the room and asked her out to go for a walk, as they accepted to do that accordingly. In the lobby, Parker saw a news report of \nMysterio\n and the 'Night Monkey' on television before Jones' arrival to meet up with and walked out of the hotel guestroom.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker walking along with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nThey made their way to \nCharles Bridge\n, and Parker listened to Jones about a fact that people used to commit public execution on the landmark. After the awkward small talk from wanting to see more of the city, Parker told Jones about something he wanted to do something he was meaning tell he about. Ready give her the Black Dahlia necklace from \nVenice\n, Parker was told by Jones that he was Spider-Man. After the interjection, Parker was momentarily silent from the statement.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker rejects \nMichelle Jones\n' accusations\n \n \nAs Jones tried to mention that it was obvious, Parker told her that he wasn't Spider-Man, despite her mentioning what happened in \nWashington, D.C.\n and that all of his absences coincided with that guess. Once Jones accused him of being in the carnival \nbattling\n \nMolten Man\n, Parker told her that doesn't know that he was in that conflict and that 'Night Monkey' was the one fighting the monster, much to Jones disbelief.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker witnesses the \nprojector\n turning on\n \n \nOnce Parker denied being Spider-Man, Jones presented an \nitem\n she took from the carnival, which was coated in \nwebbing\n. As he saw the item, Parker kept his secret and tried to dissuade her for her accusation. Once he started to realize about Jones, Parker asked her if she was looking at him because she thought he was Spider-Man, confirming that answer. Before Parker would elaborate, the item projected a momentary appearance of the \nAir Elemental\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker closely examines the \nprojector\n \n \nAfter the projection was over and startled the two of them, Parker investigated the device and deduced that it is an advanced projector. Given the image and technology, they had concluded the Elementals were all illusory projections. As Parker and Jones pondered who could have done such deception, the hologram continued, to show a simulated \nMysterio\n fighting the Air Elemental. After the projection was over, Parker realized that he had made a huge mistake.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nMichelle Jones\n he's Spider-Man\n \n \nUpon Parker's realization that Mysterio was behind a larger conspiracy, he outright confessed to Jones that he was in fact Spider-Man and really messed up. As Parker made sure of affirming that fact, he made her calm down from the questions she and told her to rush back to the hotel before they ran out of time. Back at the hotel, Parker hurriedly explained himself that \nTony Stark\n left him with the \nE.D.I.T.H.\n \nglasses\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gets ready to confront \nMysterio\n \n \nClosing the drapes of his windows, Parker speculated that he might watch him or have a \ndrone\n to kill him. With Jones being surprised that Parker had access to killer drones, he told her that he like it since he almost killed \nBrad Davis\n. Knowing that Beck might be spying him on his phone, Parker decided to undress and put on the \nStealth Suit\n. While Parker was suiting up, Leeds shockingly saw Parker and Jones together.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker ensures \nNed Leeds\n of his identity\n \n \nFinished suiting up, Parker saw Leeds entering the room and was glad to see him as part of the plan to prove that Beck is a fraud. Upon Leeds attempt to lie about Parker not being Spider-Man by letting Jones know there was a costume party, Parker told Leeds that Jones knows his secret identity by telling her outright. Jones then clarified that she knew Parker was Spider-Man a long time ago, much to Leeds surprise.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker tells \nNed Leeds\n about \nMysterio\n's lies\n \n \nParker told Leeds that Mysterio is a fraud and that despite of the news saying he saved them, Jones noted that he is trying to lie to the public eye. Parker told Leeds that Mysterio is using some illusion tech through a holographic projection. Once Leeds was caught up, Parker asked Leeds to get his \naunt\n to call Harrington and lie about \nBerlin\n. Ready to leave, Parker was given the projector and left them with a warning to keep this a secret, swinging out into the city afterwards.\n[\n3\n]\nConflict with Mysterio\n[\n]\nAmbushed by Mysterio\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swiftly swings around in \nBerlin\n \n \n\"You are so gullible.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I mean as smart as a whip, just a... sucker. Now all your friends have to die.\"\n\nMysterio\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nArriving at the \nPrague Main Railway Station\n, Spider-Man web-swung above the tracks and landed on a train. Riding all the way to \nBerlin\n, Spider-Man ran top of the train once his destination had arrived and jumped off of it. After web-swinging across the station, he landed on the ground and tried to talk to one of the locals, but she was too scared of him, thinking he was the 'Night Monkey.'\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man gets a car ride from \nNick Fury\n \n \nSpider-Man was then met by \nNick Fury\n who was driving a car and offered him a ride, prompting himself to get in the vehicle. Unmasking himself, Spider-Man attempted to explain the situation, but Fury told him to wait until the road was clear. Spider-Man was then silently told to put on his seat belt, leading him to pull it out, only for it to be suddenly stuck. Spider-Man then accidentally broke the seat belt completely, much to his embarrassment.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man explaining all of \nMysterio\n's lies\n \n \nAfter Fury had drove all the way to his own facility, Spider-Man followed him along and reached over into Fury's office. As Fury and \nMaria Hill\n were settled in the meeting, Spider-Man told them Beck was lying about the being superhero, including the \nElementals\n. Spider-Man noted that Beck had illusion tech and is tricking the public into believing him as some sort of new hero, presenting a \nillusion projector\n to Fury and Hill from the \nbattle\n in \nPrague\n. As Fury tried to backtrack Spider-Man's conclusion about Beck's deceptiveness, he further elaborated to Fury that Beck is possibly using \ndrones\n to create more destruction.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man witnesses \nMysterio\n's illusion\n \n \nOnce Fury and Hill understood the situation, Spider-Man was asked if he told anyone about this, but immediately \nsensed\n danger nearby and told Fury that Beck had arrived. As Fury and Spider-Man prepared for an attack, they were suddenly met with confusion as the entire room was revealed to be fake, including Hill's existence. As the whole facility was shown to be a construction site, Spider-Man was then fired upon by a drone from behind, shooting Fury in the process.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to fight \nMysterio\n's \ndrones\n \n \nWhile Fury was down, Spider-Man was shot across the room by the drone and felled down several feet, hitting the pavement. After the painful shot, Spider-Man slowly got up and was found being targeted at the many drones that had suddenly appeared. While Beck was talking about how Fury would always have to die but not Spider-Man, he attempted to shoot \nwebbing\n at one of the drones, but it dodged away from webs and made itself disappeared, much to his complete shock.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is trapped in \nMysterio\n's illusions\n \n \nWhile Mysterio talked over a loudspeaker about how Spider-Man should have walked away, he witnessed the drones disappearing out of thin air and projected a dark space around him. The illusion had Spider-Man in his \nred and blue suit\n, having him traverse in a nightmare illusion of Mysterio's design of a school locker room. Spider-Man spotted Mysterio in the hall and tried to use his webbing against him but were seen as green gas with no effect.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tells \nMysterio\n that this isn't real\n \n \nSeeing Mysterio from behind, Spider-Man tried to punch him in the face but was hurt by the concrete pillar that it was revealed to be. Hearing a loud echo from \nMichelle Jones\n' voice, Spider-Man ran towards a door and found himself to be on top of the \nEiffel Tower\n, stopping his tracks of moving forward. Spider-Man looked towards Jones, as she asked him what was going on, leading him to calm himself and told Beck that his illusions aren't real.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man falling in \nMysterio\n's illusions\n \n \nAs Mysterio grabbed Jones by the neck, Spider-Man willingly ran toward her as she was falling down, only for it to be another illusion. After hurting himself by landing face front on the ground, Spider-Man heard Beck's voice about telling him not knowing what's real. Spider-Man was then transported into a miniaturized version of \nQueens\n but was punched in the faced by Mysterio's hand as it went through a building and crashed into a glass wall, hitting the many web-lines surrounding him until he landed on the hood of a car.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is trapped by a hall of mirrors\n \n \nAfter being ejected out of the building, Spider-Man dropped himself to the ground and found himself in an empty lot. Being badly injured and afraid, Spider-Man witnessed Mysterio's drones again, as they descend upon him to resume the illusion of many shards of glass that stopped his tracks. Spider-Man was then alluded to imagery of himself and tried to touch one of the glasses, but was taken out of surprise when one of them pulled him in. After escaping one of their grasps, Spider-Man met himself in another mirror that was about to attack him until he punched it in the face.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting \nMysterio\n in an illusion\n \n \nAs more of himself as mirrors started to get out of the reflection, they attacked Spider-Man by piling him on top of him, taking off his Stark Suit until it was turned into his Homemade Suit. While Beck was taunting and berating him, Spider-Man then saw a series of statues that had the founding \nAvengers\n being shown to be broken in front of him but witnessed Mysterio as the one still standing. Spider-Man was then ambushed by Mysterio but evaded his energy blasts while trying to attack him with his webbing.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man haunted by an undead \nIron Man\n \n \nOnce Spider-Man shot his webs at Mysterio and tried pull him in front, he was tricked again as it was revealed to be another illusion and avoided the lifting crane he pulled. As Spider-Man dodged away more of Mysterio's energy blast, he felled down to the ground from the explosion he faced and saw a stature of a fist falling down on him, only for it to another illusion. Spider-Man then looked up to see \nIron Man\n's gravestone in front him, as he was told by Beck that if he were good enough, maybe Stark would've been alive.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is again tortured by \nMysterio\n \n \nAfter pausing on Stark's gravestone to sink the notion harder, Spider-Man was then startled by a zombified hand, as Iron Man crawled out from his grave to horrify him. While Iron Man's head transitions itself into an army of Mysterio figures, Spider-Man found himself being lost and accidentally ran into another, hurting himself again. Spider-Man was caught off guard by noticing himself inside a snow globe, as he freaked out by the buildings coming out from closely.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tells \nNick Fury\n about his friends\n \n \nAs Mysterio kept playing with Spider-Man's mind, the illusion was cut off by Fury, once he shot him in the back. Spider-Man stood up as \nEuropol\n agents surrounded Beck, while \nNick Fury\n approached him to demand anyone who knows Beck's deceit, as they might expose him. Confused and pressured, Spider-Man named Jones and \nNed Leeds\n as well as and maybe \nBetty Brant\n, but Fury laughed at him for being smart yet gullible. Confusing Spider-Man, Fury was revealed to be an illusion that Beck made to drop his guard.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is again trapped in an illusion\n \n \nWith Beck telling Spider-Man that all of his friends had to die for knowing his secret, he resumed the nightmare illusion and steered Spider-Man away from his path. Spider-Man witnessed a barrage of illusions that changed his environment, such a room full of lockers, shards of glass, and a dark room of statues that are all falling apart as he sees, while Beck kept telling him that he really is sorry. As the illusion had ended, Spider-Man was suddenly hit by a train.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man abruptly passes out on a train\n \n \nAfter being hit so hard by a high speeding train, Spider-Man managed to survive the impact of the collision with minimal harmful injuries and crawled back to the side of it. Spider-Man would finally gain access to the doorway of the train and waked forward inside, unmasking himself so that he could breathe heavily. Now further away from Beck's illusions, Spider-Man sat down on one of the seats to recover from his pain but was soon passed out from succumbing to his wounds.\n[\n3\n]\nCreating a New Suit\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker breaking himself out of a jail cell\n \n \n\"Everywhere I go, I see \nhis\n face.

I'm not Iron Man.\"\nPeter Parker to \nHappy Hogan\n[src]\nWaking up from being unconscious for hours, Parker found himself in a jail cell with a trio of soccer fans, who one of them gave him one of their shirts to keep him warm. As Parker told them they were nice for treating him so well and they're complimented their English, he was told by them that he was in the \nNetherlands\n. Freaking out over the situation, Parker tried to call the guard but was told that he was on break. Parker then broke the holding cell lock and found the inattentive security guard wearing his mask while talking on the phone.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker escapes to a \ntown\n in \nNetherlands\n \n \nThe injured Parker made his way into a town and was confused on where to go, stepping on feces from one of the barnyard animals. Parker asked a friendly stranger for his phone to call someone for help. Thinking of someone that could him get out of the situation, Parker decided to call \nHappy Hogan\n, who picked up immediately. While they were talking, Parker asked the man to tell Hogan exactly where they were, as he had no idea how to pronounce \nBroek op Langedijk\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker witnessing \nHappy Hogan\n's arrival\n \n \nWondering into a remote field surrounded by tulips, Parker witnessed Hogan arriving in the \nStark Industries Private Jet\n. Given the recent deceptions from \nQuentin Beck\n, Parker demanded Hogan to prove himself to be real, asking Hogan to tell him something only he would know. As Hogan recalled their time staying at a hotel in \nGermany\n, revealing his awareness of Parker pay-per-viewing an adult film, a flustered Parker told him to stop talking and hugged Hogan for comfort after what he had faced.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker opens up his feelings to \nHogan\n \n \nWhile inboard the jet, Hogan was providing first aid to Parker, stitching up a wound on his back. After feeling too much pain from the suturing and being told to relax, Parker got up from his seat and angrily vented to Hogan about how he failed to stop Beck from taking the \nE.D.I.T.H.\n \nglasses\n away and now Beck will use it to kill his friends and other civilians. Calming himself down, Parker apologized to Hogan for his outburst and expressed how much he missed \nTony Stark\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker listening to \nHappy Hogan\n's speech\n \n \nTaking a moment to think, Parker tearfully expressed how everywhere he went, he saw Stark's face and was asked if he was going to be the next Iron Man. Parker admitted he felt incapable of living up to his mentor's legacy. Hogan then reminded Parker that he'll never be Iron Man and that not even Stark could ever live to it. Hogan revealed that Stark always second-guessed everything he did, but never regretted picking Parker to be the next superhero to protect the world and be looked up to.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker finds his friends leaving in \nLondon\n \n \nOnce Hogan gave Parker the necessary motivation to focus on stopping Beck, Parker stood up and declared that he will kick Beck's ass. While Hogan asked Parker what to do when leaving, Parker noted that he can't call his friends because Becks tracking them and asked Hogan's mobile phone to find them. Knowing \nFlash Thompson\n had a livestream going on his school trip, Parker learned that his friends were in \nLondon\n, leading Hogan to prepare flying the jet.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker accesses \nTony Stark\n's technology\n \n \nParker then asked Hogan that he needed a suit, leading Hogan to activate a hidden room with a suit synthesizer which Stark had left in for him. To the surprise of Parker, he commanded the machine to bring up anything it had on Spider-Man. Looking at the many \nSpider-Man Suit\n designs available, he focused on the designs of different \nWeb-Shooters\n and while he was about to work on them, he looked over to Hogan smiling at his ingenuity.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker upgrading his own taser \nwebbing\n \n \nHogan told Parker to focus on the suit, while he handled the music for the occasion. While Hogan turned on \nBack in Black\n on the sound system, Parker mistaken the artist for \nLed Zeppelin\n upon taking off. As the jet took off for London to intercept with Beck, Parker told the machine to bring up his Web-Shooters again and upgraded its taser \nwebbing\n by increasing the voltage, as well as giving complete control over detonation.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks \nHappy Hogan\n to send his gift\n \n \nAfter finishing his suit design and waited for printing of it, Parker was told that he gave \nNick Fury\n a code to let him know that he is being tricked into believing Beck's lies. As Hogan noted that he will pick up his friends, Parker told him that his suit was almost done, and later asked him to give his Black Dhalia necklace to \nMichelle Jones\n in case of something happens, but Hogan refused and told him to give it to her later once this is done.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker explaining his plan against \nMysterio\n \n \nOnce Hogan asked Parker how his plan would go, he explained that all he needs to do is go inside Beck's illusion tech so that he could take it down, find Beck, and take E.D.I.T.H. back into his hands. While Hogan counteracted his point about him being hit by a train, Parker noted to him about his sixth sense, having Hogan be familiar with it as the \"Peter Tingle.\" Being told by his \naunt\n's words, Parker told Hogan that does work, despite his unsure of its fully active. As Hogan left for the plan, Parker awaited for his new suit to finish.\n[\n3\n]\nBattle of London\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man and \nHappy Hogan\n fly to \nLondon\n \n \n\"Whoa... Peter, you sure \nthat\n's not real?\"\n\"Yeah, it's just a hundred times bigger than I expected.\"\n\nHappy Hogan\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nArriving in \nLondon\n, Spider-Man rode on the side of the \nStark Industries Private Jet\n, while \nHappy Hogan\n piloted it over to the city. While Hogan asked Spider-Man how he was feeling, he told him that felt great and even thanked him for complimenting his \nnew suit\n. Entering London airspace, they saw the huge \nElemental Fusion\n raiding on the \nTower Bridge\n, Spider-Man noted that it wasn't real, and is now a hundred time bigger than he had anticipated.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man prepares for his mission\n \n \nOnce Spider-Man told Hogan to get the jet high enough so that \nMysterio\n won't see him coming, they were soon hoisted up in the air above the Elemental Fusion. As the jet has got enough air that is set in the plan, Spider-Man told Hogan that when this is done they must have a serious conversation with him and his \naunt\n before letting go of the jet. As Spider-Man head dives into the Elemental Fusion above, he equipped himself with his new parachute to slow down his altitude and used his paraglider to move forward into through the illusion.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man inside the \nElemental Fusion\n \n \nAfter heading towards the illusion and telling himself that it isn't real, Spider-Man crashed into one of the \nCombat Drones\n that was projecting the Elemental Fusion, looking all over in awe of how the illusion was made so efficiently to prepare for such larger than life. Spider-Man then used his \nwebbing\n to stick onto one of the Combat Drones he was holding on, and with his superhuman agility, created a linkage between some of them in a row, in order prepare setting them up for destruction.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man partly destroys the illusion tech\n \n \nOnce Spider-Man was finished settling the webs to some of the drones, Spider-Man took a moment to dismount the last drone he was on. Spider-Man shot his web to set off the control of his taser webbing which detonated the amount of electricity being circuited within his webbing on some of the drones that were connected. Spider-Man landed on top of a Combat Drone and looked over to see the illusion being cut off as the drones were exploding.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man charges to attack \nMysterio\n \n \nWhile the illusion has set off a number of Combat Drones that now reappearing, Spider-Man looked over to see Mysterio in his \nmotion capture suit\n and prepared to attack inside the room where he's hiding. Unbeknownst of Spider-Man, Mysterio called \nE.D.I.T.H.\n for protection, causing one of the Combat Drones to attack him. After being hit against the wall and falling down to the ground, Spider-Man painfully gets up from the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man contacts \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nAware of and agitated by Spider-Man's interference, Mysterio had cut the illusion and ordered the drone fleet to attack Spider-Man around \nTower Bridge\n. Spider-Man contacts Hogan after noticing an explosion from far away, asked him if he was fine after tracking his friends through \nFlash Thompson\n's livestream. Now knowing that Mysterio is attacking him, Spider-Man ran away from the firing of the many Combat Drones and jumped away, swinging across to avoid any crossfire.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is surrounded by many drones\n \n \nTaking cover by a car, Spider-Man attempts to contact Hogan again to ensure if he is safe, being told that he and his friends are fine. Spider-Man told Hogan that he's trying to get to Mysterio but can't avoid the many Combat Drones, all while using his webs to shoot above and use the car in front of him to cling onto and swung up to push the car onto the drones, destroying them completely. Landing on top of the bridge, Spider-Man saw the drones using flames against him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man rides on a Combat Drone\n \n \nAs he avoided the flames by swinging away from the built in flamethrowers, Spider-Man was then caught in the flames and tried to shake them away from his suit. With his upgraded suit, Spider-Man handled the drones and confined them to the side of the bridge with his webbing, sticking onto them until they explode on impact. Spider-Man swung under the bridge and used the water to put out the flames on his suit and then using one of the drones for a ride around the bridge.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man trapping many Combat Drones\n \n \nAfter drone that he was riding had been destroyed, Spider-Man shot his webbing at one the drones and swung up around to destroy the many upcoming drones in front of him. Now above the two bridges, Spider-Man used his webbing to set a trap between them and swung up into the string of webbing to enclose them with his webs and bring them down, destroying the surrounding drones that were all around him. As the big explosion had settled Spider-Man away from him in the air, he landed on his feet in satisfaction that handled them all.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees the illusion forming again\n \n \nAfter the coast was seemingly cleared, Spider-Man was then pushed back by one of the Combat Drones and was slammed by one of the cars that were piled on, causing him fall onto the water. Swimming back up and managing to get up from the shoreline, Spider-Man saw the drones lining up to prepare the illusion. Jumping over to the bridge again, Spider-Man realized his out of web fluid and looked over to see if he can reach above to get to Mysterio.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man prepares for an attack\n \n \nUpon sighting a downed drone with a concussion wave being blasted continuously, Spider-Man found a toy and threw it at its sonic cannon, which projected the toy into the air and the drones overhead attacked it. Based on this, Spider-Man then devised a plan by using the battery of a broken drone, paired with the broken off sign of the Tower Bridge. After getting his supplies, Spider-Man prepared to charge forward and attack the drones from above.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man apprehends Mysterio in the air\n \n \nAs the drones saw him running, Spider-Man used the sign as a shield and threw the battery at the drones, leading them to destroy it. As the drones had exploded next to each other, Spider-Man used the sign to hoist himself up to one of the upper walkways, breaking the glass floor below it. Hanging upside down, Spider-Man apprehended Mysterio and broke his interface dome helmet, which disengaged the remaining drones piercing the vault of the \nJewel House\n, and deactivated upon reaching Hogan and Parker's friends.\n[\n3\n]\nDuel with Mysterio\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man demands back the Tony Stark's Glasses\n \n \n\"Your lies are over, Beck.\"\n\"This certainly isn't ideal, but I have contingencies. \nE.D.I.T.H.\n?\"\n\"Just give me the \nglasses\n.\"\nSpider-Man and \nMysterio\n[src]\nAtop \nTower Bridge\n's upper walkway, Spider-Man had hold \nMysterio\n up in the air after breaking his dome helmet. Spider-Man told Mysterio that his lies are over but was told that he had contingencies and was shot down by one of the summon \nCombat Drones\n that Mysterio had called upon through \nE.D.I.T.H.\n's network. Being shot at and send several feet away from Mysterio, Spider-Man got up on his feet and told Mysterio to give up the \nglasses\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man uses his \nSpider-Sense\n \n \nOnce Mysterio asked Spider-Man if its the glasses he was holding are the ones he wants, he witnessed a number of Mysterio's Combat Drones disappearing as well as himself, transforming the rest of the room into dark void with green gas clouding all over the ground. Being noted that he has get the glasses back, Spider-Man took a breather to focus on the goal and prepared to use his \nSpider-Sense\n to avoid the Combat Drones. With his eyes closed, Spider-Man ran towards the hall once he was ready to fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nCombat Drones\n \n \nSpider-Man then jumped up to the side of the wall and punched down an incoming drone from down under. Spider-Man continues to attack the numerous drones by using his superhuman agility and strength to dodge away any incoming fire or drone charging at him. Using the pipes on the ceiling for more leverage, Spider-Man kicked down a drone and stopped one of them with his bare hands. Spider-Man grabbed another drone and split it to two pieces, stabbing any incoming drone that gets in front of him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man confronts \nMysterio\n \n \nAs the dark illusion had fallen apart, Spider-Man used drone as a shield to protect himself from fire until he broke free and pushed a drone back. Once Mysterio was shot down by drone that was pushed, Spider-Man wrestled with a drone until it blow him back against the ceiling, causing him to knock down incoming drones away and destroy the final drone. Once Spider-Man destroyed the last drone in the walkway, he stood over Mysterio and asked him if he had a reason to do all this.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man stops \nMysterio\n's attack\n \n \nAfter Mysterio told Spider-Man that he agreed on his behavior and how he deserved the glasses the whole time, Spider-Man sensed his surroundings again while Mysterio was about to pass the glasses down to him. Spider-Man then grabbed Mysterio's wrist without looking and turned over to him, noting that he can't be tricked by his illusions anymore. As the illusion fell apart, Spider-Man took the glasses away from Mysterio and told E.D.I.T.H. to turn off the drones.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man calls off all of the \ndrones\n \n \nAs the biometric scan was completed once Spider-Man had put on the glasses, he was asked if he wants to execute all cancellation protocols for the remaining Combat Drones, answering yes to execute all the drones. Once E.D.I.T.H. confirmed to execute the drones, Spider-Man witnessed the drones flying away from the Tower Bridge, as they return into the \nStark Industries Satellite\n that is hanging above in space.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man checks if \nMysterio\n is really dead\n \n \nHappy to see all the drones gone, Spider-Man took the glasses off and turned back over to Mysterio, as he dropped to the floor from his injuries. Spider-Man asked Mysterio how he could do all of this, being told that people need to believe and that now in days people will believe anything before Mysterio had succumb to his wounds and died. Putting on the glasses, Spider-Man asked E.D.I.T.H. to confirm if Mysterio's death was an illusion, being told that all illusions are down.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is reunited with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nWith the crisis averted, Parker then exited the walkway and into the Tower Bridge, where \nMichelle Jones\n discovered him, hugging each other for comfort. Asking if anyone else is fine, Parker listened on as Jones confirmed that his friends survived. After Jones noted to Parker that the drones were attacking her and suddenly stopped, he told her that it him that stopped them. Jones further noted that she brought a mace in case Parker needed some help.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker passionately kissing \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nWhen Jones brought up that \nHappy Hogan\n gave her a Black Dhalia necklace, Parker was disappointed that it broke and told her about his whole plan to give it to her in \nParis\n, but was then kissed by her. As Parker was confused, he was told that she had difficulty getting attached to people and wasn't just looking at him because he's Spider-Man. As they expressed their feelings to each other, Parker and Jones passionately share a kiss before returning to the trip.\n[\n3\n]\nLeaving Europe\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nJones\n rests on the plane\n \n \n\"So glad you're okay!\"\n\"No. For real, I'm good. I'm actually really... fine.\"\n\nMay Parker\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nWith the \nMidtown high school\n European Tour trip concluded, Parker managed to get back into his group and onto the airplane for a ride home. Parker took a nap on the flight with \nMichelle Jones\n, as they slump over for resting too deeply, chuckling at their mishaps and continued resting for whole ride home.\n[\n25\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker happily talking to \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nOnce the fight ended upon landing back into \nNewark\n, \nNew Jersey\n where they were about to greet by their respective families, Parker and Jones walked together in the airport, holding hands to signify their new relationship. While the rest of the group were meeting their families, Parker asked Jones if anyone has figured out his secret identity, being noted that no one has since nobody really pays attention to him, except for her; thanking her for the compliment.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker reunites with his \naunt\n at the airport\n \n \nAs Jones left the airport, Parker was told by \nBetty Brant\n they look cute together, leading him to offer her and \nNed Leeds\n to go on a double date. Parker was told by the two of them that they broke up, being told that when men and women grow apart their journey will always be with them. When Parker exited the airport to find his \naunt\n, he found her as she was about get a ticket, hugging her in relief and noted to her that he felt fine before she asked him about his bags until she remembered that they were blown up.\n[\n3\n]\nIdentity Crisis\n[\n]\nDate with MJ\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks his \naunt\n if she's dating \nHogan\n \n \nA week after returning from \nEurope\n, Parker went on a monologue in his home about how he kept his identity very guarded for the last couple of years and faced a lot of deception. Parker was tired of the lies and had an intervention with his Aunt \nMay\n and friend \nHappy Hogan\n about them becoming a couple. When Parker asked his aunt of the question, May told him they weren't dating at all, much to the confusion of Hogan.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker leaves the \napartment\n for his date\n \n \nAs Parker was confused from their unclear dynamic, he continued listening to May and Hogan argue about their status, with May feeling unsure where Hogan was taking their brief romance and Hogan rationalizing that they might have a relationship which can grow. Once the conversation grew awkward as it was revealed that Hogan is stuck at being friends with May, Parker excused that he has go out for a date with \nMichelle Jones\n, departing as fast he could.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man takes a selfie while swinging\n \n \nAfter Spider-Man made his awkward exit, he started swinging over to Jones and got his phone to take a picture of himself web-swinging. Spider-Man continued to swing over high distances and ran on walls of a building, apologizing to the employees who were inside of it. As Spider-Man kept on \nweb-slinging\n around \nNew York City\n, he received a text from Jones, saying he shouldn't text and swing before almost hitting himself against a bus. After swiftly dodging it, Spider-Man ran on top of the bus and continued on web-swinging.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swiftly continues to web-swing\n \n \nGoing up on a building to gain some momentum, Spider-Man shot his webbing at the top and ran on the side of rooftop, giving him edge to jump off it and dive straight into the air. As he neared the location he intended, Spider-Man activated his equipped web-wings and glided through a new opening in the former \nAvengers Tower\n to the \nGrand Central Terminal\n. He then landed on a street pole to break his momentum, and spun down to plant his feet to meet Jones.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swinging with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nNow on the ground, Spider-Man met with Jones on the sidewalk and apologized to her about being late. As Jones told him it was fine, Spider-Man asked her if she's ready, as she accepted before telling her that she's going to love it. Starting their date, Spider-Man swung with Jones across the city, which placed her in a state of heightened fear given the speed. Spider-Man continued on over City Hall where Jones screamed in terror as they were in the air holding hands.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man drops off \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAfter some time passed, Spider-Man was told by \nMichelle Jones\n that he could put her down now, leading him to stop at \nMadison Square Garden\n. Spider-Man asked her if she was fine, as Jones assured him that she was indeed but admitted to not enjoying the ride with him. Once the two mutually agreed to never do that again, Spider-Man parted ways with Jones and perched atop a light post, waving bye as she left.\n[\n3\n]\nPublic Enemy Number One\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man watching the news in public\n \n \n\"Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker!\"\n\"What the fu?!\"\n\nMysterio\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nTaking notice of the breaking news broadcast from the \nNY1\n station, Spider-Man turned around to watch the outer television monitor of the stadium. As news anchor \nPat Kiernan\n reported on the \nattack\n in \nLondon\n, Spider-Man listened closely about an anonymous source that provided video of \nMysterio\n's final moments before his death. As Mysterio talked over in the video, Spider-Man was accused for killing him and staging a crisis to try and become the \"next \nIron Man\n.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees his identity being exposed\n \n \nWhen Kiernan went on about having the footage being cited from the controversial online news site, \nThe Daily Bugle\n, the online tabloid's host, \nJ. Jonah Jameson\n, accused Spider-Man to be responsible of the murder of Mysterio, who would go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. As Jameson went on, the broadcast showed more footage, displaying Mysterio revealing Spider-Man's civilian identity, horrifying Parker as he swore in public.\n[\n3\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees \nJones\n being harassed\n \n \nParker then looked down below at Jones and watched as crowds swarmed around her, with people asking if she was Spider-Man's girlfriend. Parker lept off the light post and makes his way to Jones, pushing through an angry mob. Some angrily asked him why he killed Mysterio and begin to push him and Jones, with one woman even attempting to unmask him in public, only for her to yell aloud that he attacked her even though he was just defending himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man receives a call from \nNed Leeds\n \n \nParker grabbed ahold of Jones and swung away through \nTimes Square\n passing jumbotrons revealing his identity and labeling him as \"Public Enemy #1,\" as well as billboards referencing \nRogers: The Musical\n. During their escape, Peter asked if it was possible to lay-low at Jones' \nhouse\n. Jones told him no, saying her \nfather\n definitely disliked Parker now that he knew Parker was Spider-Man. Parker improvised and landed atop the \nQueensboro Bridge\n. On the bridge, Parker received a video call from \nNed Leeds\n, who was anxious over the reveal.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man escapes with \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAs Parker panicked with Leeds, Jones interrupted reminding him of the uncomfortable height he had left her in. Parker turned around and tended to her safety, just as \nWLGJ\n helicopters began to surround them. Parker, along with Jones, leapt off the bridge and swung his way into the Subway station below, narrowly missing a train. They instead escaped through a sewer hole in the street, right in front of the newly reopened \nDelmar's Deli-Grocery\n, and then swung off towards his \napartment\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nJones\n arrive in his \napartment\n \n \nFrom there, they arrived at his \napartment\n and he helped Jones sneak inside his bedroom window. As Parker was undressed out of his suit, \nHappy Hogan\n and his \naunt\n opened the door and thought he and Jones needed privacy as they were engaging in a sexual act. Parker put a shirt on and told his aunt, albeit awkwardly, that he wasn't doing what she thought, as she came inside to meet Jones.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker learns the helicopters are outside\n \n \nAs they went in the living room, Parker demanded an explanation of their breakup, before learning that the WLGJ helicopters were flying around his apartment. Parker used his \nWeb-Shooters\n to close the blinds, as his aunt and Hogan discovered from that the world now knew about Parker's dual identity as Spider-Man.\n[\n5\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is assaulted with paint in public\n \n \nSometime later, Parker left the apartment in his \nsuit\n to catch a drug dealer. Rather than being thanked for his heroics, he got into an argument with some pedestrians regarding his age as a Mysterio supporter ambushed him by jumping out and splashing green paint across his suit, much to Parker's annoyance and frustration.\n[\n26\n]\nRepresented by Matt Murdock\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker realizes the \nfeds\n have arrived\n \n \n\"I don't believe any of the charges against you are gonna stick.\"\n\"Wait, seriously?\"\n\"Oh, I knew it.\"\n\"Oh, my God, Mr. Murdock. Thank you.\"\n\nMatt Murdock\n. Peter Parker and \nMay Parker\n[src]\nHowever, just as Parker and his \naunt\n were watching the news about the incident, their \napartment\n began to be investigated by the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n, who took photographs of all of Parker's equipment as evidence.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gets interrogated by Agent \nP. Cleary\n \n \nParker, his aunt, \nNed Leeds\n, and \nMichelle Jones\n, would later be taken into Damage Control custody on a warrant, charging them with various crimes. They arrived at the \nNYPD\n precinct. Agent \nP. Cleary\n attempted to interrogate Parker about the \ndrones\n that were used in the \nBattle of London\n. Much to Parker's shock, when he tried to state the truth, saying that \nNick Fury\n could vouch for him, he discovered that \nhe\n had actually been off-planet for a year. However, before he could say anything else, his aunt, Leeds, and Jones walked past with Jones and his aunt telling him not to say anything without a lawyer.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks to \nMatt Murdock\n \n \nParker eventually enlisted the services of \nMatt Murdock\n to represent him, who successfully got his criminal charges dropped. Despite his criminal charges getting dropped by Murdock, he was warned by the latter that despite getting rid of legal troubles, things would still be much worse, as there was still the court of public opinion, and Hogan would also need a really powerful lawyer to defend himself against any lawsuits as it was his responsibility that Parker used Stark Tech that potentially caused damage.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is shocked by \nMatt Murdock\n's catch\n \n \nMuch to Parker's shock, when a \nMysterio\n supporter suddenly threw a brick inside the apartment window aimed at Parker, the blind Murdock managed to catch the brick before Parker. When Parker questioned Murdock on how he did that, he just said that he was a really good lawyer.\n[\n5\n]\nInterviewed by Betty Brant\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker being interviewed by \nBetty Brant\n \n \n\"Tell me.

I would say thanks.\"\n\nBetty Brant\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nLater on his classmate, \nBetty Brant\n, interviewed Parker for \nThe Daily Bugle\n where she asked him if whether or not he would thank the spider that bit him to give him powers. When Parker answered that he would thank the spider because it allowed him to save people, Brant interrupted him trying to get Parker to say that he would not thank the spider, which Parker couldn't interpret as an attempt to take him off controversy.\n[\n5\n]\nCondominium Relocation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker moves into \nHogan\n's \ncondominium\n \n \n\"What's that noise?\"\n\"Oh.

After arriving at Hogan's home, Parker tried to clean his dirty \nSpider-Man Suit\n but failed to do so despite his best efforts, eventually giving up, after feeling immense disgust from cleaning it up.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker talks to \nMichelle Jones\n about college\n \n \nLater on, Parker had discovered that Hogan had a \nStark Industries Fabricator\n within the workshop of his apartment, similar to the one that he used to build an upgraded suit for himself, discovering that it could build almost anything he wanted to build, much to his awe. Later on, towards the night, Parker called Jones, where they both discussed about their applications to their preferred institute, \nMIT\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker enjoys face-time with \nJones\n \n \nParker told Jones that ever since he got bitten by that radioactive spider, that he only had one week where he felt normal was when she and everyone whom he wanted to know about knew he was Spider-Man, and everyone finding out his true identity ruined that for him. However, their special moment was ruined by Hogan who told them to wrap it up as he was trying to sleep, telling him he needed his eight hours of sleep, much to Parker's shock as he learned he had been listening the whole time.\n[\n5\n]\nCollege Admission Problems\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker faces unwanted publicity\n \n \n\"Keep watching \nMidtown News\n all year as we bring you up-close and personal coverage of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet: College admission!\"\n\nBetty Brant\n[src]\nA couple months later, with his criminal charges cleared, Parker headed into \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n for his first day of senior year, after his summer break, where he, \nMichelle Jones\n, \nNed Leeds\n, and \nFlash Thompson\n were surrounded by pro-\nMysterio\n supporters, calling Parker and his friends horrible and demeaning names, terming Parker as the \"Devil in Disguise\" and people behaving creepily towards Jones, much to Parker's frustration. However, Parker was guided by the \nNYPD\n officers on crowd control, who led him inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sees \nRoger Harrington\n's mural of him\n \n \nLater on much to Parker's awe, Parker saw \nRoger Harrington\n and \nJulius Dell\n, who welcomed him back into school, saying that it's an honor to serve him, while \nAndre Wilson\n, who supported Mysterio, accused Parker of murder and called him a murderer. Furthermore, he discovered that Harrington also made up a mural of him with all of the pictures of Parker, all the accolades that he achieved, and statues made under his name, with them informing him that he is free to do whatever he wants to do, all much to his annoyance as students began to take pictures of him while he walked down the hall.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nMichelle Jones\n rest on the roof\n \n \nFrustrated from all of his newfound fame, Parker and Jones decided to go out to Midtown's rooftop, an undisturbed area with privacy, discussing and laughing about all of the new controversies regarding Spider-Man, such as him supposedly having the ability to hypnotize females. However, just before the duo were about to kiss, they were interrupted by Leeds who came there out of his own issues with privacy.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker speaks with \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAfter his acquittal, Parker had given an application to the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n along with Jones and Leeds, along with other backup institutes, in hopes for a fresh start in \nBoston\n with Parker hoping he could continue being Spider-Man there, hoping to maintain a happy life with his friends, as they planned to live together. Parker was eventually warned by Jones that they should expect otherwise owing to the recent controversies, telling him to expect disappointment so that they won't be disappointed in the future. Despite his friends' suspicions Parker chose to remain optimistic as he believed they would get admitted.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker anxious about college applications\n \n \nLater on, much to Parker's shock, his, Jones, and Leeds' applications were being continuously rejected by every other institute due to his involvement with Mysterio, despite his excellent grades. However, a resilient Parker chose to keep quiet as he still hadn't received his MIT application form back. He remained anxious every time his \naunt\n would return from the mail.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker disappointed about being rejected from \nMIT\n \n \nThat November, when Parker received his M.I.T form he instantly went to \nPeter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop\n, the cafe where Jones worked at, so he could meet up with her and Leeds, planning to open up their letters together as friends to face their future. Much to his shock, he discovered that not only he was rejected due to his direct association in the death of Mysterio, but his friends were also being dragged downhill as they were rejected despite their high grades in light of recent controversy.\n[\n5\n]\nMultiversal Crisis\n[\n]\nSeeking Doctor Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker entering the \nNew York Sanctum\n \n \n\"Peter.

I mean, this is really hurting a lot of people.\"\n\nDoctor Strange\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nAfter seeing Halloween decorations in the form of a wizard, Parker thought of asking \nDoctor Strange\n for assistance and used his phone to locate the \nNew York Sanctum\n. At the entrance, he looked for a doorbell, but the Sanctum's doors opened up on their own, and Parker slowly walked inside, seeing that the Sanctum was full of snow and ice.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker speaks with \nWong\n \n \nHe saw a young woman and man shoveling the snow and was then met by \nWong\n, who arrived from an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n. Parker asked him what happened and Wong explained that a blizzard from \nSiberia\n had accidentally been transported in. Strange then levitated down to them and greeted Parker. Much to Parker's shock, he learned that Strange was no longer the Sorcerer Supreme, since he had \nblipped\n, and that Wong had taken the title.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asking \nDoctor Strange\n for help\n \n \nParker then addressed Strange as \"sir,\" but Strange told him that due to their shared experiences in the \nInfinity War\n and \nBattle of Earth\n, he did not need to be so formal. Parker called him Stephen instead and proceeded to ask if there was a way that Strange could reverse time before \nMysterio\n revealed his identity. Strange told him he no longer had the \nTime Stone\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker listens to \nDoctor Strange\n and \nWong\n \n \nStrange then told him he could cast a memory spell known as the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n, which Wong warned Strange not to, as it was too dangerous. Strange pleaded with Wong, telling him that they had used it before at \nKamar-Taj\n. Wong reluctantly agreed before leaving for Kamar-Taj through another portal.\n[\n5\n]\nTampering with the Spell\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker ruins the \nspell\n \n \n\"Let's not change the parameters of the \nspell\n anymore while I'm casting it.\"\n\"Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done. But my \nAunt May\n should really know.\"\n\"Peter, stop tampering with the spell.\"\n\nDoctor Strange\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nDoctor Strange\n took Parker to a lower level of the \nNew York Sanctum\n to start the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n that would make everyone forget that Parker is Spider-Man. Parker learned that it included his \naunt\n, \nbest friend\n and \ngirlfriend\n. Panicked, he asked Strange to let them remember. However, he then asked about \nHappy Hogan\n remembering and then yelled out that everyone who knew before should still remember.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker's tampering causes a \nMultiverse\n tear\n \n \nParker's actions backfired, as the spell became unstable and damaged the fabric of the \nMultiverse\n, causing people who knew Spider-Man's identity from other universes to emerge in theirs. Strange managed to get the unstable spell intact and close the tear temporarily.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is chastised by \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nAfter realizing that Strange failed to complete the spell, Parker asked him why he didn't do it, discovering that his exemptions caused the spell to fail. Much to Parker's delight and embarrassment, Strange asked him if he had asked the \nMIT\n Administrator to convince them to admit Jones and Leeds, noting that was a simple decision that would have worked, much to Parker's awe. After Strange found out he didn't do so prior to contacting him, Parker immediately got kicked out of the Sanctum.\n[\n5\n]\nAppealing to MIT\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker calls \nFlash Thompson\n \n \n\"Okay, I'll tell everyone that you're my best friend. Flash, please help me.\"\n\"Cool, cool, cool. So there's this lady. The \nassistant vice chancellor\n. You can plead your case with her.\"\nPeter Parker and \nFlash Thompson\n[src]\nDespite getting kicked out of the \nNew York Sanctum\n, a satisfied Parker got the idea to find someone at \nMIT\n to appeal \nLeeds\n and \nJones\n' applications to MIT. As soon as he could think, Parker called a busy \nFlash Thompson\n and asked him for the contact details of the \nMIT Assistant Vice Chancellor\n so he could appeal for his friends' application.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gets information from \nFlash Thompson\n \n \nAfter some reluctance from Thompson to reveal the details, Parker struck a deal with him on the condition that he would tell everyone that Thompson was his best friend, much to Parker's frustration. Thompson informed Parker that the MIT Assistant Vice Chancellor left to the airport, sending him a picture of the Assistant Vice Chancellor so that he can find her.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man arrives on \nAlexander Hamilton Bridge\n \n \nFinding out that she was currently on the \nAlexander Hamilton Bridge\n en route to an airport, Parker donned his \nIron Spider Armor\n and flew to the bridge. Upon landing, he heard a news helicopter and turned around to waved at them. As the \nStark\n network was offline, Parker could not use the Iron Spider's technological abilities to locate where the Assistant Vice Chancellor was, forcing him to search manually.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker detecting incoming danger\n \n \nParker found her car and, knocking on her window to speak to her, tried to convince her to reconsider Michelle Jones' and Ned Leeds' rejected applications. Suddenly, Parker's \nSpider-Sense\n alarmed him about the upcoming danger, as he noticed people running away from the bridge.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle with Doctor Octopus\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man meeting \nDoctor Octopus\n \n \n\"What have you done with my machine?\"\n\"Your ma I don't know what you're talking about. What machine?\"\n\"The power of the \nsun\n, in the palm of my hand. It's gone.\"\n\nDoctor Octopus\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nParker then activated his \nIron Spider Armor\n before \nDoctor Octopus\n emerged from underneath the \nbridge\n and asked him where his machine was, much to Spider-Man's confusion. Doctor Octopus immediately attacked Spider-Man by using his \ntentacles\n to throw cars at him, forcing Spider-Man to either evade them or save civilians who were still inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fights against \nDoctor Octopus\n \n \nAs Spider-Man was distracted, Doctor Octopus grabbed him with the tentacle and threw him at a UPS truck, remarking that he should have killed \nhis girlfriend\n when he had a chance. Assuming that he was talking about \nMichelle Jones\n, a provoked Spider-Man engaged in a fierce fight with Doctor Octopus, using his spider-legs against the tentacles. However, when Spider-Man heard that the \nMIT Assistant Vice Chancellor\n was trapped in a falling car, he immediately rushed to save her, almost fully saving her, but was grabbed by Doctor Octopus, who then tried to force him into the spinning blades of a nearby helicopter. Spider-Man managed to free himself from Doctor Octopus' grip and caught a car with his \nweb\n, while evading Doctor Octopus' attacks.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man reveals his identity\n \n \nAlthough the woman was relatively safe, Spider-Man was open to Doctor Octopus' attack who pinned him down to the bridge with his tentacle. Doctor Octopus damaged the armor, which made the \nnanites\n of the armor connect with his tentacles. Doctor Octopus then attempted to kill Spider-Man by impaling his vulnerable spot, but the nanites of his mask protected him. Doctor Octopus saw Spider-Man without his mask and remarked that he was not the \nPeter Parker\n he knew, which greatly confused Spider-Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees \nGreen Goblin\n \n \nUsing Doctor Octopus' confusion, Spider-Man connected his suit with the nanites attached to his tentacles and managed to take control over them, with the former being incapable of controlling the tentacles, thereby posing little threat, so Spider-Man used the tentacles to get him and the Vice Chancellor back on the bridge safely. All of a sudden, \nGreen Goblin\n appeared on the bridge, having tossed one of his \nPumpkin Bombs\n to cause an explosion, and zoomed towards Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus using his \nglider\n.\n[\n5\n]\nTracking Multiversal Trespassers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is startled by \nLizard\n \n \n\"That \nlittle spell\n that you botched where you wanted everyone to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, it started pulling in everyone who knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man, from every universe into this one.\"\n\"From every universe?\"\n\nDoctor Strange\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nJust before \nGreen Goblin\n attempted to attack Spider-Man, he and \nDoctor Octopus\n were transported into the \nNew York Sanctum\n, where \nDoctor Strange\n imprisoned Doctor Octopus and \nLizard\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker learns the \nMultiverse\n is real\n \n \nStrange informed Parker that Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and Lizard, the latter whom Strange \nfound from the sewers\n, were not from their universe, but from \nparallel\n \nrealities\n within the \nMultiverse\n, who were pulled into this reality by the \nfailed spell\n since they were aware of Spider-Man's true identity, much to Parker's awe that the Multiverse was real.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker receives an upgrade from \nStrange\n \n \nParker was recruited to help find and capture these \"visitors\" as he received a magic-based upgrade to his \nsuit\n, with one \nweb\n shot transporting his enemy back to the Sanctum. Strange told Parker that since he had messed up, it was his job to fix all of this, telling him to grab the rest of the villains before their reality was damaged until the point it could not be recovered. Parker agreed to help Strange and told him that he was ready to sort out his mess, but he needed some help.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker hugs \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nParker decided to enlist the help of \nMichelle Jones\n and \nNed Leeds\n, owing to his past experiences with them giving him leads to the villains, bringing them to the Sanctum where Strange asked them to sort out their mess. Parker tried to refrain from telling his friends about the spell made that bought the villains to their universe but failed as Strange ended up telling them anyways. However, much to Parker's relief, his friends handled it relatively well, with Jones making Strange ask for help in a gentler way as it was actually his fault as the caster that the spell got messed up, much to Parker's delight.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker works at the \nNew York Sanctum\n \n \nAfter going down to the Undercroft along with Jones and Leeds, Parker tried to apologize to his friends for asking Strange to cast the spell. However, Parker was reliefs to hear that Jones and Leeds were quick to forgive him as they understood his well-meaning intentions. Parker was also told by Jones that the next time he wanted to solve a problem, maybe he should just consider telling them so they could figure out the problem as a group, which he happily agreed to. Later, Parker, Jones, and Leeds shared fun moments as he introduced them to the two captured villains, Doctor Octopus and Lizard.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker in \nNew York Sanctum\n's undercroft\n \n \nAs Parker was preparing for capturing the villains, he tried to clean his dirty suit but failed to do so despite his best efforts, so he turned the suit inside out for the time being as \nMay Parker\n told him that she would clean his suit later on. Later on, Leeds managed to trace a \nsuspicious activity\n at a military research facility outside of \nNew York City\n, whom he thought was the \nvillain\n at the \nbridge\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker researches with \nLeeds\n and \nJones\n \n \nHowever, just as he was discussing about him, Doctor Octopus intervened and explained to him that it was impossible that Norman Osborn was alive as in his universe, he was a megalomaniacal, misguided villain who died after being impaled by his own \nglider\n during a fight with his \nSpider-Man\n, saying that either they saw someone else or he was going outside there to fight ghosts, much to Parker's shock.\n[\n5\n]\nCapturing Sandman and Electro\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man witnesses \nElectro\n \n \n\"Peter, it's me!

Due to his body being made up of pure energy, Spider-Man failed to transport the villain to the \nNew York Sanctum\n, as the \nweb\n went through his body. Electro attacked Spider-Man, firing continuous electric blasts at him, forcing Spider-Man to maneuver through the trees to avoid the attacks.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is saved by \nSandman\n \n \nSoon after, Electro had gained the upper hand over Spider-Man after he cornered him and hit him with a blast to cut off his communication with \nJones\n and \nLeeds\n. However, before he was finished by the being, he was saved by \nSandman\n, who intervened to shield the boy as he mistook him for the \nPeter Parker\n he knew. Sandman built a wall to protect him from the electricity before Spider-Man asked him for help to take Electro down.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker speaks with \nSandman\n and \nElectro\n \n \nPromising to clear all things up with Sandman, the two work together to cut the power lines, which fully restored Electro's body to its normal condition. Parker and Sandman then watched as Electro came to the ground to meet them. Electro asked what was going on and Parker informed him he was from \nanother universe\n. When Electro remarked that he had no clothes, Parker found some construction suit nearby and gave it to him. He then used the device to send Electro to the Sanctum. Upon seeing this, Sandman believed Spider-Man killed him and confronted Parker on his actions but was promptly teleported away also.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker fixes the power lines\n \n \nParker then called Michelle Jones as he asked her if Electro and Sandman arrived at the Sanctum safety, which she confirmed to him. Also, Parker thanked Jones for helping him out and could not have done it without her help. Deciding that he had to clean things up in order to keep his record clean before the media did anything against him, Spider-Man decided to stay at the electrical tower in order to clean up the area, telling Jones that he will be finding \nNorman Osborn\n later on.\n[\n5\n]\nMeeting Norman Osborn\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker at the \nF.E.A.S.T.

But you're not \nhim\n.\"\n\"Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?\"\nPeter Parker and \nNorman Osborn\n[src]\nThat next morning, Parker finished repairing as much damage from the \nbattle\n as he could through his webbing. Parker was then called by \nMay Parker\n to come at the \nF.E.A.S.T. Community Center\n immediately as one of the villains he was looking for came there. A scared Spider-Man immediately went towards the F.E.A.S.T. Community Center as he feared one of the villains might have put his aunt at risk. However, Parker was relieved that his aunt was okay but was shocked to see her talking with one of the universe displaced men.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker meets Norman Osborn\n \n \nAfter hearing his first name from his aunt, Parker realized that he was \nNorman Osborn\n. Parker was about to tell Osborn that he thought he was dead, due to the information he got from \nDoctor Octopus\n earlier. However, Parker did not get a chance to as Osborn told him that he came to \nF.E.A.S.T.\n looking for his \nSpider-Man\n as he thought he could help him but was surprised that he was not the one he knew from \nhis universe\n. Hearing this, Parker was stunned that Osborn wanted Spider-Man's help as his aunt told him that he wandered into the building. Parker then listened to Osborn explain to him and his aunt that he did not know where else to go, as he doesn't have his home, life or \nfamily\n in this universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker speaks with his \naunt\n \n \nHearing Osborn's situation, Parker felt guilty for unintentionally taking him away from his family and life. Also, Parker found out through Osborn that he had two different personalities and realized that it was him on the \nbridge\n before but was under the control of his alter ego, who went by Green Goblin. Parker then talked with May as he told her that the villains had their own mental and physical issues like Osborn did.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker refusing to help the villains\n \n \nAlso, Parker was told by May that the \nMultiverse\n intruders were troubled people who needed his help. However, believing that the group weren't his responsibility and \nDoctor Strange\n knew best, Spider-Man told May that Osborn and the others could get help back in their home universes. When his aunt asked him that sending the group back was best for them or for himself, Parker became unsure as he didn't answer her question. Parker also listened to his aunt telling him them that helping others is what they do. However, despite his aunt's words, Parker still refused to help the group as he told her that she should surrender Osborn to him.\n[\n5\n]\nScuffle with Doctor Strange \n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker thanks his \naunt\n for his clean \nsuit\n \n \n\"It's over, Parker.

Math.\"\n\nDoctor Strange\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nParker and \nNorman Osborn\n were driven by \nMay Parker\n to the \nNew York Sanctum\n and he got his \nsuit\n back, which had now been cleaned from the green paint. Parker thanked May before he brought Osborn to the undercroft as he introduced him to \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker learns the fates of the villains\n \n \nHearing that Osborn recognized the initials of his girlfriend, Parker was not only surprised that another version of her exist in his universe but also that MJ could be short for a different name, \nMary Jane\n. Then, Parker found out that Osborn, \nDoctor Octopus\n, and \nElectro\n were spared from their deaths in their Spider-Man's universes, which greatly shocked him, and he began to question \nDoctor Strange\n's intentions.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man takes the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n \n \nWhen Strange arrived with the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n, he explained to Spider-Man that these three were doomed to die fighting \ntheir\n \nversions\n of Spider-Man, and that he planned to reverse the \nspell\n and send them back to their fates for the sake of the greater \nMultiverse\n. Convinced that they could be cured of their antagonistic natures and be spared from death, Spider-Man stole the box containing the spell before Strange could use it and ran off.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is knocked out into his \nastral form\n \n \nHe ran outside the Sanctum and tried to escape, but was stopped by Strange who told him to hand the box over. When Spider-Man didn't, Strange used his \nSling Ring\n to summon two \nInter-Dimensional Portals\n to stop him. He then used an \nEldritch Whip\n to bring him down. Strange then knocked him into the \nAstral Dimension\n. Parker believed he was dead, but was amazed to learn what had happened and that he could make autonomous movements for him to not allow Strange, who was just as surprised as he was, to take his box as he flew towards his body.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting the \nCloak of Levitation\n \n \nSpider-Man then swung away, only to be stopped by the \nCloak of Levitation\n which wrapped itself around his shoulders and tried to pull him back down. Spider-Man managed to free himself and tried to swing away. However, Strange opened up the \nMirror Dimension\n and sent Spider-Man into it. Spider-Man free fell throughout the Dimension, crashing throughout the city falling inside a shopping mall and other buildings.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker falls through the \nMirror Dimension\n \n \nAfter falling into \nCentral Park\n, Strange opened a portal, and a subway train came through, hitting him and temporarily separating him from the box. Spider-Man grabbed the box again, as the Cloak reached him and grabbed it as well. Strange then sent him through portals while the Cloak continued to grab hold of it. Eventually, Spider-Man managed to cause the portals to collide, which then shattered the Dimension.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees the \nGrand Canyon\n \n \nThis action separated them from the box and transported them to the \nGrand Canyon\n in \nArizona\n. Strange then opened a portal and told Spider-Man he would return for him afterwards. Unfazed, Spider-Man decided to use the situation to his advantage, discovering the various mathematical possibilities to trap someone within the Dimension.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker traps \nStrange\n in \nMirror Dimension\n \n \nSpider-Man then entangled Strange in a matrix full of his \nwebs\n through the use of geometry. Afterwards, he grabbed the box and prepared to hop into the open portal. Strange told him not too, but Spider-Man used his web to take his Sling Ring and left the Dimension. Before he left, Parker apologized to Strange for the predicament but did tell him that he had to try and help the group before sending them back to their universes.\n[\n5\n]\nAttempting to Alter Fates\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker makes his return to \nLeeds\n and \nJones\n \n \n\"I think I can help you guys.

He told them he had a fight with Strange and won. Parker told his friend that he had taken Strange's \nSling Ring\n, which he gave to Leeds. Also, Parker told Jones and Leeds that he was in the \nMirror Dimension\n, then told them that Strange was trap but he wasn't sure for how long. When \nDoctor Octopus\n asked Spider-Man as to why he saved them and did not let Strange send them home to die, Jones told him that it was not who Parker would be.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker offers to help everyone return home\n \n \nParker told the group that he could help them as he explains to them that if he can fix what happened to them and when they go back home, they might not die fighting their \nSpider\n-Man\n. Also, when \nElectro\n asked him as to what he meant by fix them, Parker explained to the group of villains that the technology in his universe was advanced. However, Parker was interrupted by \nNorman Osborn\n, who genuinely wanted to help the group, especially Octavius, and himself, as he told him that he could assist him in his plan in curing the group. Although he was surprised that Osborn was willing to help him, Parker nevertheless accepted his offer for assistance.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker giving his orders to \nLeeds\n and \nJones\n \n \nAfter finding out that \nLizard\n, who was skeptical of his idea to help the group, could talk and being asked by Electro as to what his plan was to help the group, Parker told him he had it under control. He then talked with Jones and Leeds about the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n as they agreed that they needed to keep it safe from the villains. Trusting his friends and not wanting to endanger them, Parker tasked them of keeping the Macchina safe and to wait for him in case they needed to press the button to send the universe-displaced home. Parker did his handshake with Leeds and kissed Jones as they left.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker explains his plan to the villians\n \n \nHe then turned around and told the universe displaced villains his plan. After they all agreed to come with him, Parker released them from their confinement and called his \naunt\n in order to pick the group up. Parker alongside his aunt took Electro, Lizard, \nSandman\n, Doctor Octopus, and Osborn to \nHappy Hogan\n's \ncondominium\n in an attempt to try to cure them. Also, Parker's plan to cure the group was through the use of the \nStark Industries Fabricator\n he had discovered early on in his friend's apartment.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker brings all of the villains to the \ncondo\n \n \nUpon arriving, Parker told his aunt that he feels bad about using Hogan's place like this, but she told him that their friend will get over it. While everyone got settle into hanging out in the condominium, Parker was asked by Doctor Octopus that if this was his plan to help cure the villains as he was skeptical of him using a condominium instead of a lab or facility and believed that he was going kill them all, which he would hope not to do.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker showing off the \nStark Fabricator\n \n \nParker decided to work on Doctor Octopus, who believed that he did need fixing, first as he went to the room where he found the fabricator before as his Aunt May, Osborn, and Electro followed him, as he showed the three of them as to what he planned to use to cure the group of villains. Also, Parker explained to Osborn and Electro as to what the fabricator would do as he opened it up, but accidentally dented the wall in the kitchen, which Doctor Octopus heard and became terrified as he was fully convinced that Parker was going to kill them all.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker works with \nNorman Osborn\n \n \nWhile Electro, Sandman, and Doctor Octopus hung out in the living room, and Lizard was in the \nF.E.A.S.T.\n truck, Parker had discovered the root cause of Octavius' issues as he told Osborn that the \nchip\n on the back of his neck was designed to protect his brain from his \ntentacles\n' AI, but the chip was fried, and the tentacles were now controlling him. Parker and Osborn worked on making a new chip for Octavius through the fabricator.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker successfully curing \nDoctor Octopus\n \n \nAfter finishing a new chip for Octavius with Osborn's help, Parker asked his Aunt May to set Doctor Octopus up so he could administrate it to him, despite Octavius' reluctance. Peter took off the original inhibitor chip made by Octavius himself, but Parker struggled with putting the new one in as Doctor Octopus kept moving his head. However, after grabbing his head, Parker was able to put the new inhibitor chip onto Octavius' neck, but he fell unconscious. Parker was going see if Doctor Octopus was okay, but regained consciousness, before he could.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker pleased that Octavius was cured\n \n \nSeeing that he woke up, Parker was relieved that Octavius was alright and was pleased that the chip work in restoring his mind. After Octavius upgraded his \nsuit\n by returning him back the \nnanites\n that he had taken from his \nIron Spider Armor\n, Parker was thanked by the latter for giving him control of mind back. Also, Parker was offered help from Octavius in curing the rest of the villains, including Osborn, which he accepted.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker activates \nElectro\n's cure to charge\n \n \nParker worked together with Octavius and Osborn in curing Connors, Dillon, and Marko, even creating an \nanti-serum\n for the latter in order to restore him to his full sanity. After Dillon's \ncure\n was ready and was given the device by Octavius, Parker began to work on him and talked with him as he sat in the kitchen. However, Parker left the kitchen for the back room when he heard that another cure was ready and decided to have a look. Parker then found out that Marko's \ncure\n was close to being done as he decided to make some adjustments before giving it to him.\n[\n5\n]\nLosing Everything\n[\n]\nChaos and Calamity\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker's Spider-Sense going off\n \n \n\"Peter, you listen to me. You have a gift. You have power. And with great power, there must also come great responsibility.\"\n\"Yeah. I know.\"\n\nMay Parker\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nHowever, before he could finish \nFlint Marko\n's cure, Parker's \nSpider-Sense\n went into overdrive, and he stopped what he was doing. Parker then got up in a panic as \nOtto Octavius\n and \nNorman Osborn\n noticed how worried he looked. When Octavius and Osborn asked him what's wrong, Parker told them that he didn't know.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sensing nearby \ndanger\n \n \nParker called his aunt, who was on the stairs, as he wanted to make sure she was safe, while Octavius and Osborn, who were concerned about their friend, followed him to the living room. Although he was relieved that his aunt was not harmed, Parker looked around the living room for the source of the danger. However, due to not being unable to visually discern who was the cause of it, Spider-Man closed his eyes as he trusted his senses and reflexes to guide him to the culprit, who was revealed to be Osborn.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker realizes Osborn is the threat\n \n \nHis senses did the work for him, resulting in him reluctantly firing a \nweb\n shot at Osborn, revealing him to be the cause of the \nGreen Goblin\n alter re-emerging from within his mind. Hearing a different tone in Osborn's voice, Parker realized that it was Green Goblin, the latter's alter ego that he told him and his aunt about earlier. Parker, May and Octavius listen Green Goblin taunting them for helping Osborn take away his power.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker witnesses the \nGreen Goblin\n alter\n \n \nHearing Green Goblin taunting him about power, Parker pointed out that he did not know him, but the latter proved him wrong as he told him that he saw how his aunt trapped him and argued with her holy moral mission. Parker also listened to Green Goblin telling him that his powers along with the others were not diseases to be cured but rather gifts that made them gods. A shocked Parker told his aunt to run as his spider-sense told him Green Goblin was posing a threat to her.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man furiously fighting \nGreen Goblin\n \n \nElectro\n, convinced by Green Goblin's philosophy, attacked Octavius and sent him out of a window as he was forced to leave the area, while \nSandman\n fled the scene. Meanwhile, Spider-Man battled with Green Goblin and the two engaged in a fierce and brutal battle throughout the entire building with Green Goblin. Green Goblin and Spider-Man fought a ferocious battle in which the latter discovered Green Goblin's immense power, forcing him to use his full strength against him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is attacked by \nLizard\n \n \nGreen Goblin threw Spider-Man out of a window, and as Spider-Man held onto the side of the building, he looked down below and saw \nThe Daily Bugle\n watching. He was then suddenly attacked by \nLizard\n, who grabbed him, told him he was right, that he could not help them, and threw him back inside of a window. Green Goblin then proceeded to fight him again, crashing through multiple levels, until they reached the first.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to stop the \nPumpkin Bomb\n \n \nHowever, before he could choke him to death, his aunt ran to them and stabbed Green Goblin with the first version of his \ncure\n. Unfortunately, it did not work, and Green Goblin called his \nGoblin Glider\n, which struck her, fatally injuring her as Green Goblin then proceeded to throw a \nPumpkin Bomb\n and escape. Parker tried to catch it before it exploded, sending the foyer crashing down.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker's last moments with \nMay Parker\n \n \nAs Spider-Man awakened, he checked on May, who at first assured him that she was fine as she told him that he did the right thing in not sending the villains back to their universes to meet their fates. Parker listened to May's advice that with great power there must also great responsibility before she collapsed from her wounds. Spider-Man attempted to call for help, but it was too late as May passed away in his arms but not before reassuring her nephew he did the right thing.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is told to run away by \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nAs \nHappy Hogan\n arrived to see Spider-Man mourn over his aunt's death, armed \nDamage Control\n agents arrived to mercilessly force him out of his car and arrested him. Hogan then told Spider-Man to run which he reluctantly did, getting shot in the shoulder before leaving his aunt's corpse under a hail of bullets from the armed agents.\n[\n5\n]\nMeeting Other Spider-Men\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker mourns over the death of his \naunt\n \n \n\"\nShe\n told me that with great power...\"\n\"Comes great responsibility.\"\n\"Wait, what? How do you know that?\"\n\"\nUncle Ben\n said it.\"\nPeter Parker, \nPeter Parker\n and \nPeter Parker\n[src]\nWith the loss of \nMay Parker\n, an emotionally broken Spider-Man retreated to the top of a building and watched on a huge screen of \nJ. Jonah Jameson\n reporting on the recent event, feeling immense guilt for the death of his aunt along with all of the chaos and calamity he caused in his decision to save the villains who betrayed him, in the rainy weather.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker meets alternate universe versions of himself\n \n \nParker then retreated to the top of \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n and wept. Eventually, he was found by \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n, who hugged and comforted him. He was also greeted by \ntwo\n \nalternate versions\n of himself from the respective universes the villains came from. Having given up any sort of hope of saving the villains and believed that his aunt died for nothing, Spider-Man told his alternate selves that he was going to use the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n he had taken from \nDoctor Strange\n to return them all to their respective universe regardless of their eventual fates.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker recalls the with great power line\n \n \nHowever, the alternate Parkers proceeded to tell Spider-Man about the people they lost as well, with the eldest talking about how he couldn't save his uncle \nBen Parker\n and the other on how he failed to save his girlfriend \nGwen Stacy\n and as a result of her death he became bitter and more violent, unable to hold back his strength when fighting enemies and telling him that they did not want to see him follow that dark path, reminding him of what May told him \"With great power, comes great responsibility,\" assuring him that May's death was not in vain if they stopped them.\n[\n5\n]\nMidtown Lab Project\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThe three Peter Parkers work together\n \n \n\"I think that I can repair the devices for \nDillon\n and \nMarko\n, but the others...\"\nPeter Parker\n[src]\nAfter his spirit got renewed, Parker, \nNed Leeds\n, \nMichelle Jones\n and the two other Spider-Men decided to use the chemistry classroom of \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n to prepare for their final battle with the villains, creating anti-serums against them. Using their knowledge of their respective villains, they managed to come up with cures to their powers, with one Parker handling \nLizard\n, and the \neldest Parker\n handling \nGreen Goblin\n, saying that he had been planning for quite a long time. Parker was hesitant to let the eldest Parker make Green Goblin's \ncure\n, but relented.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker is comforted by \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nAs his Spider-Men developed the cures for everybody else, Parker continued to repair the devices that he had devised earlier to cure, \nElectro\n and \nSandman\n, with his friends assisting him and the two other Spider-Men around as they developed the cure for all of the villains. As a nervous Parker was feeling guilty about what he did and the damage it caused, telling Jones that she and his allies did not deserve to suffer the consequences of his action, a supportive Jones consoled a nervous Parker who told him to look at her, telling him that they would get through this together, and that she would not be going to go anywhere.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker makes a plan\n \n \nLater on, as Leeds prepared the web-fluid cartridges for all of them, Parker discovered that the eldest Spider-Man could produce his webbing organically, much to his shock, with \nAmazing Spider-Man\n questioning how organic webbing would even function. However, before anyone else could ask anything else, Parker decided to continue on with his planning, deciding to go to the \nStatue of Liberty\n, the place that would always represent second chances, using the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n as a lure. Much to Parker's surprise, Leeds said that he could \nportal\n them there using \nDoctor Strange\n's \nSling Ring\n. Leeds also promised that he would not turn into a supervillain and kill him, much to Parker's confusion.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle at Liberty Island\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man calls \nThe Daily Bugle\n \n \n\"I don't know how to work as a team.\"\n\"Me neither.\"\n\"Well I do. I have been in a team, okay? I dont wanna brag, but I will. I was in the \nAvengers\n.\"\n\nSpider-Man\n, \nSpider-Man\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nOnce finished, the group went to the \nStatue of Liberty\n which was under construction to be redesigned to sport the new \nCaptain America's Shield\n. Before the battle, Parker called into the \nThe Daily Bugle\n and talked to \nJ. Jonah Jameson\n, admitting his fault in bringing all the villains here to their universe and tell them he was going to fix his mistake in the end. Parker asked the people of New York to wish him luck as he prepared for the upcoming battle, telling the villains that he really did try to help them despite having the power to kill them at any given moment just because \nMay Parker\n taught him to do better than that, using the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n as a bait to invite the villains.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man sees \nElectro\n arrive\n \n \nThe three Peter Parkers joked and conversed with each other regaling about the villains they had fought and their adventures before the group of villains finally arrived, with \nElectro\n commencing the battle as he arrives fully charged by the \nArc Reactor\n. As the battle began, Parker handed off the box to \nMichelle Jones\n and \nNed Leeds\n so that the villains cannot fetch it, which unfortunately went wrong as Leeds couldn't close his \nportal\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is grabbed by \nSandman\n \n \nThe Spider-Men headed into battle with \nFriendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n fighting \nLizard\n as \nAmazing Spider-Man\n fought against Electro. The duo barely managed to hold their own, requesting Spider-Man to deliver the cure to their respective villains. Just before he was about to do that, Spider-Man got ambushed by \nSandman\n, who grabbed him to get hold of the box so that he could return to his family, not listening to him despite all of his pleas. Spider-Man failed to grab the cure to heal Sandman as he continued to struggle against his grip until one of his counterparts landed scaffoldings on him to slow him down.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man takes charge\n \n \nAs the battle went within the villains' favor, Spider-Man deduced that he Spider-Men had serious communication problems, with them being unable to coordinate together. Informing them that he had been in the \nAvengers\n, which to his shock he discovered did not exist in the other two Spider-Men's worlds, Spider-Man took the position as the field commander. Taking the alias of Peter-One, Parker tagged the eldest Spider-Man as Peter-Two and Amazing Spider-Man as Peter-Three. Parker then advised they needed to coordinate their attacks, trust their senses, and attack the villains one at a time.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe three Spider-Men as a team\n \n \nGoing in with a renewed spirit, the Spider-Men ran towards their aim and jumped off the scaffolding, swinging to their destination together, now as a team. As they dashed into battle, Peter-Two fought off Sandman, while Peter-Three attacked Lizard, while Spider-Man got ambushed by Electro, telling them using their earpieces they have to cure Sandman first, with him meeting Peter-Two inside the statue to do so, whilst planning to meet Peter-Two at the top to cure Connors. Just as he was being attacked by Electro, Spider-Man managed to deliver the antidote of Sandman after getting it from Peter-Three, back to Peter-Two who managed to successfully cure Sandman, undoing his sand-like state.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man helps attack \nElectro\n \n \nJust as that happened, Peter-One and Peter-Two immediately rushed to help Peter-Three who was struggling against Electro, who was more powerful than ever. Spider-Man told Peter-Two and Peter-Three they had to take the Arc Reactor away from Electro in order to stand a chance, making a plan to make Peter-Two to go right and Peter-Three to go left, in order to subdue Electro in a three-way attack. The attempt failed miserably as he held his other two Spider-Menin captive, owing to his incredible power, as Spider-Man fell back to the scaffolding.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fights \nLizard\n \n \nLizard broke free from Peter-Three's webbing and rushed back into the open portal into \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n. Spider-Man pursued him to rescue Jones and Leeds, yelling at Lizard to stop. Lizard grabbed him and threw him across the laboratory, destroying tables and chairs in the process. Spider-Man then ran after Lizard through another portal back onto the scaffolding.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man turns \nCurt Connors\n to normal\n \n \nMeanwhile, Electro proved to have grown too strong and nearly killed Peter-Three, due to absorbing the power of the Arc Reactor. However, they were saved when \nDoctor Octopus\n arrived. Octavius pretended to be on Electro's side before removing his Arc Reactor and draining him of his power with \nElectro's Cure\n. Just as Spider-Man was struggling fending off Lizard, he was saved off by Jones who handed him the \nLizard Antidote\n, allowing him to turn Lizard back into Curt Connors, much to his relief.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Spider-Men face \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nDoctor Strange\n then arrived through one of Leeds' portals and confronted Parker for leaving him dangling over the \nGrand Canyon\n for twelve hours. Parker apologized to him, telling him that they were close to curing the villains with only Osborn being left of being cured. When Parker introduced his alternate universe versions to Strange, he told Parker that while he was surprised by what he had accomplished, they still had to send them back to their universes before the damage done to their universe became irreversible.\n[\n5\n]\nFighting Green Goblin\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man tries to save \nMichelle Jones\n \n \n\"Poor Peter. Too weak to send me home and die?\"\n\"No. I just want to kill you myself.\"\n\"Attaboy!\"\n\nGreen Goblin\n and Spider-Man\n[src]\nBefore \nDoctor Strange\n could activate the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n to reverse the \nspell\n, \nGreen Goblin\n arrived and attempted to snatch it; however, Strange managed to disarm him. Unfortunately, though it turned out Green Goblin had already put a \nPumpkin Bomb\n in the box which detonated. Destroying it and leaving Strange with no way to send the villains as well as the other Spider-Men back to their respective timelines.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man is taken away by \nGreen Goblin\n \n \nThe bomb also destroyed the scaffolding in the Statue of Liberty knocking \nMichelle Jones\n off as Spider-Man dove to save her, Green Goblin intercepted him with the \nGoblin Glider\n. Fortunately, Peter-Three managed to save her. As Spider-Man downed the glider by detonating a Pumpkin Bomb inside the aerial vehicle, the two landed on the shield replica for the Statue of Liberty.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker angrily confronts \nGreen Goblin\n \n \nAfter getting up, Green Goblin taunted Spider-Man that he was still too weak to send him back home to his universe to die, although Spider-Man, filled with anger and hatred for what Green Goblin has done, told him that he simply wanted to be the one to kill him. An impressed Goblin sicken praised him as the two engage in an intense battle. An enraged Spider-Man fueled solely by anger and hate and no longer holding back, brutally beat Green Goblin into submission.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker prepares to kill \nGreen Goblin\n \n \nFueled with rage, Spider-Man grabbed the glider and attempted to stab him to death with it. However, before delivering his brutal punishment, he was stopped by Peter-Two who blocked the strike by holding the glider at bay, until Spider-Man finally calmed down and came to his senses, after realizing this was not what May would want for him.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker gives \nNorman Osborn\n the cure\n \n \nSuddenly Peter-Two was stabbed by Green Goblin, heavily injuring him and proceeded to taunt Spider-Man that May's death was strictly on him for not killing them when he had the chance as Green Goblin laughed and taunted Spider-Man. Peter-Three threw Spider-Man the cure to Green Goblin serum who then ejected it into Green Goblin in retaliation, finally freeing Osborn of the Green Goblin alter once and for all.\n[\n5\n]\nOne Way Home\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker asks \nStrange\n to cast the \nspell\n again\n \n \n\"They're coming here because of me, right? Because I'm Peter Parker? So cast a new spell. But this time, make everyone forget who Peter Parker is. Make everyone forget... me.\"\nSpider-Man to \nDoctor Strange\n[src]\nRealizing Strange's increasing inability to contain other individuals who know of his identity would result in the complete collapse of the multiverse, Parker chose to tell him to cast the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n but to alter it so that the entire universe would forget about Parker's existence altogether.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker thanks \nDoctor Strange\n a final time\n \n \nStrange was initially hesitant as it would result in him, among Parker's other loved ones, having no memory of him. Parker elected to recommend the casting anyway, as it would be the only method of ensuring the stability of their universe, atoning for his initial tampering of the spell, and ensuring the safe return of the displaced individuals.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker says goodbye to \nhis\n \ncounterparts\n \n \nParker then went to check on \nFriendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n and \nAmazing Spider-Man\n, thanking them for assisting his efforts. When the elder Spider-Man reminded him that it was they did, Parker informed them that he had to go see his friends before giving them both a hug farewell.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker says goodbye to \nLeeds\n and \nJones\n \n \nParker then spent one last private moment with \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n, the latter of whom shared a passionate kiss with Parker before he departed from the island. The spell was then initiated, ridding them, and the entire universe, of their knowledge of Peter Parker.\n[\n5\n]\n Pre-existing imagery or footage of Parker suddenly left him out or obscured him in some other way.\n[\n26\n]\nMaking Sacrifices\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker arrives at the \nPeter Pan Donut Shop\n \n \n\"How'd you know \nher\n?\"\n\"Through Spider-Man. You?\"\n\"Same.\"\n\nHappy Hogan\n and Peter Parker\n[src]\nIn December, Parker went to \nPeter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop\n, intending on reconnecting with \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n by reminding them of their past relationships together. Upon approaching Jones to order a cup of coffee, he introduced himself to her, albeit awkwardly, with the former not paying attention to him, as she greeted Leeds who came nearby, making Parker realize she had fully forgotten him once and for all.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker sees \nNed Leeds\n happily ignoring him\n \n \nParker then noticed the pair's shared excitement for being admitted into MIT, reminiscing about his efforts to get all three of them into the same university so they were able to stay in touch. When Jones temporarily broke off with Leeds to take his order, Parker glimpsed at a band-aid on her forehead, immediately reminding him of the physical harm she had suffered during the \nrecent events\n. A feeling of guilt enveloped Parker's subconscious as he came to terms with the danger he once put his closest friends in by opening up to them about his superheroics, and their assistance in his endeavors.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker decides to let \nJones\n and \nLeeds\n go\n \n \nRealizing that reconnecting with them would break them away from their personal aspirations after high school, in addition to endangering them by resuming their involvement in his personal life, Parker ultimately forfeited the chance to engage in any further conversation with either Jones or Leeds to keep them safe from any further harm that would come as a result of his vigilantism, and simply exited the cafe after receiving his coffee, but not before saying goodbye to Jones.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker visits Aunt \nMay Parker\n's gravesite\n \n \nLater, Parker visited his \naunt\n's gravesite at a local cemetery, grieving her death. Soon after, much to his shock, he was soon joined by a now-oblivious \nHappy Hogan\n, who asked Parker how he knew May. Parker replied that he knew her through Spider-Man, in which Hogan replied the same. Hogan then told Parker that then recalled losing his friend \nTony Stark\n a person like May fairly recently. This prompted Parker to reassure him that the people she helped would continue her work, before exchanging goodbyes with Hogan and wishing him well.\n[\n5\n]\nNew Independence\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nParker moves into his brand new \napartment\n \n \n\"Rent is due on the first of the month. Don't be late.\"\nLandlord to Peter Parker\n[src]\nAround a month later, now completely alone, Parker becomes fully self-sufficient, but decided to cut ties with his allies and fellow superheroes in order to protect them. Taking some personal belongings with him from the \nParker Residence\n, Parker moved into a cheap \napartment\n and began to settle in, homaging the close friendship he forged with \nNed Leeds\n, as well as the romantic relationship he shared with \nMichelle Jones\n, by keeping the LEGO minifigure of Emperor Palpatine from the Death Star set Leeds and Parker built together, and the coffee cup Jones gave Peter at the cafe, as mementos for their respective contributions to Parker's personal life, in spite of their obliviousness to his existence at present.\n \n \n \n \n \nParker begins rebuilding his life by himself\n \n \nResuming his efforts to live a simpler life under both his civilian and heroic personas, Parker borrowed a \nGED\n textbook to complete his lost secondary academics and bought a sewing machine to create a new \nSpider-Man Suit\n by hand, taking inspiration in the visual design from the original Stark suit and \nhis\n \ncounterparts\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swings over \nRockefeller Center\n \n \nOne night, having tapped his phone into the Police Radio Frequency to keep himself notified of ongoing crime, he was quickly alerted to a situation requiring a car tow for assistance. Honoring his vow, Parker quickly exited his apartment through the front window and swung through \nRockefeller Center\n, passing the Christmas tree and ice rink, soaring with a newfound sense of freedom, and liberated of juggling two lives, continuing his heroics as Spider-Man.\n[\n5\n]\nBy \n2027\n, Spider-Man's heroics were public enough to be singled out by mayor \nWilson Fisk\n during his crackdown on vigilantism.\n[\n27\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"Look, when you can do the things that I can, but you don't... and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you.\"\nPeter Parker to \nTony Stark\n[src]\nOutside of his Spider-Man persona, Parker lived the life of a normal high school student, being a very intelligent, science enthusiast, and capable of inventing and building his own \nWeb-Shooters\n, as well as homemade computers. Parker is also an avid Star Wars and science-fiction fan, making frequent pop-culture references to it in battle. In addition, Parker is highly impressionable towards figures of authority, which is likely due to his young age and inexperience. Parker even takes harsh words and criticism to the heart, as this caused him to question his heroics and intentions in helping those in need, loves and cares about. Despite this, Parker is a friendly and kind but shy and awkward individual; he is happy to talk but often stumbles on his own words in a conversation.\nThrough his love of science, Parker was amazed to find out that the \nMultiverse\n was real, as seen during his first conversation with \nMysterio\n, but thought it was a lie once he discovered his ruses. However, after his encounter with \nDoctor Octopus\n and \nGreen Goblin\n, and \nDoctor Strange\n telling him that the botched \nspell\n he messed up brought individuals from two different universes, Parker was not only shocked that the multiverse truly does exists but also realized that Mysterio was unknowingly telling him the truth. Parker's intelligence is boundless as he is smart in other subjects, such as math. Also, Parker's intelligence has impressed many, as \nTony Stark\n, Stephen Strange, Quentin Beck, Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius were amazed by his knowledge and skills.\nAs Spider-Man, Parker is courageous and capable, being able to come up with clever strategies due to his scientific expertise. His bravery even led him to secretly board a \nQ-Ship\n in an attempt to help Iron Man against the universal threat of \nThanos\n, despite knowing that Parker could lose his life in the \nconflict\n to come. He frequently annoys his enemies with fast-talking humor and quipping, prompting members of both \nCaptain America\n's faction and Iron Man's to ask how old he was during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n. Parker was also overly-excited about being Spider-Man and constantly called \nHappy Hogan\n to ask him about \"a new mission with the \nAvengers\n,\" unknowingly irritating him. He was very displeased about having to stick with minor jobs like stopping a bike theft or helping an elderly woman. Despite this, Parker would still put those in need first before himself as his \nAunt May\n taught him the true meaning of helping people and that everyone deserves a second chance whether they are good or bad.\nIn the beginning of his superhero career, Parker made sure that he kept his identity as Spider-Man a secret since if such knowledge were to be made public, his aunt would be worried sick and he would have major trouble with the law on the grounds of vigilantism. Parker also showed a strong desire to impress the other superheroes and prove his worth, especially towards Iron Man. In addition, Parker would get frustrated when other superheroes do not take him seriously, due to his young age, although it maybe due to wanting to prove himself and them that he can handle being Spider-Man despite being a teenager. Parker was particularly angered when he found out that Stark was limiting many of his \nsuit\n's functions with the \nTraining Wheels Protocol\n and demanded \nNed Leeds\n to hack into the suit to disable it, but it ended up putting him at a disadvantage, due to not being familiar with the suit's full capabilities. In addition, during the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport, Parker was the least experienced fighter.\nParker also values life and has a code to not kill people, as seen when he ordered \nKaren\n to not make him hurt anyone when he activated his 'advanced combat mode'. In addition, Parker tried to stop Vulture from overloading his wings and when it happened, he risked his life to save him from the explosion and resulting fire, even though he tried to kill him and knows his secret identity. Also, Parker's code to not kill people has led to a disagreement or fight with individuals, as shown when Doctor Strange insisted on sending a group of villains from different realities back to their universes and meet their fates instead of trying to help them, due to them having mental and physical issues. However, despite his value on life, he was shown to use a strategy that would threaten the lives of his enemies, as his plan to have Iron Man breach the hull of the Q-Ship they were in resulted in the death of \nEbony Maw\n, who was sucked into the vacuum of space.\nSometimes, Parker can be reckless and doesn't think before he acts, as those traits caused him to make various mistakes. Also, in rare instances, Parker's recklessness has threatened the lives of innocents, as some of his battles nearly hurt or killed anyone that were in the area, and almost unintentionally broke the multiverse when he asked Doctor Strange for help in restoring his secret identity, but ended up changing his spell when he still wanted those who are closes to him to still know about his double life. However, despite all the mistakes he has made, Parker still has good intentions and would always try to do the right thing. Also, Parker would use his mistakes as a learning experiences as he becomes more aware of his flaws and more determined to rise above them.\nParker at times has shown to have a guilt complex, as seen when he blamed himself for Iron Man and his Aunt May's deaths. His guilt for his aunt's death was further accentuated by \nJ. Jonah Jameson\n's gaslighting reporting, leading him to nearly abandon his mission of curing the multiverses visitors of their antagonistic qualities and give up to send them back to their fates until his \nalternate\n \nselves\n convinced him to finish what he started. Also, Parker's guilt was one of the main reason he decided to distance himself from his friends, allies and fellow superheroes, after they have forgotten his existences through Strange's second spell, as he didn't want to put them in danger and ruin their lives.\nThroughout his attempt to capture Vulture, Parker managed to hone his skill with his suit through the help of Karen. Also, Parker was able to better understand the dangers of being a superhero, becoming more serious and determined to capture Vulture on his own while wanting to prove to both himself and Stark that the Spider-Man Suit is not what makes him strong. In addition, after he successfully stop Vulture and his operation, Parker made the mature choice in turning down Stark's offer to become an official Avenger as he realized that he wasn't ready, a decision which Iron Man himself applauded. Also, overtime, Parker has shown to become a mature and responsible as both a person and superhero, as it was fully shown when he decided to stop the Multiverses from breaking apart by having Strange make everyone magically forget his existence, knowing full well he would never get his old life back and would now be nothing more than a stranger to his loved ones, demonstrating his maturity from an overly eager, careless teenager into a selfless, heroic young man ready to lose nearly everything in order to protect the world and rectify his mistakes.\nWhen he was anointed as an official Avenger, Parker was shown to be both honored and exhilarated. However, after the events of Infinity War and \nBattle of Earth\n, Parker shied away from the spotlight as he tried to avoid Avenger-level threats and decided to keep being a street crime-fighting hero, which was in contrast to when he initially wanted to do more and become an Avenger. Despite this, Parker would still fight the bigger threat in order to protect those he loves, the innocents and the world. Also, Parker ultimately found his resolve to continue protecting the innocent as the web-slinger, even after being left all alone and a ghost to the world except for his Spider-Man persona, due to losing Stark and his aunt, and his friends, allies, and the entire universe having no memory of him after Strange's second spell. In addition, Parker took being unpersoned as a second chance to be a better Spider-Man and atone for all the mistakes he has made.\nParker deeply cares about his friends, Stark, his idol, mentor and father figure, and Aunt May, his only family. His friends, Stark, and aunt being in danger is the one thing that would push Parker over the edge, as he would abandon his own morals and lay down his life in order to protect them. Also, if those he loves got hurt, Parker would reveal a darker and more sadistic side, as seen during the final conformation against Green Goblin, even going to the point of trying to murder him, despite Osborn being trapped inside him. However, Parker came back to his senses as his oldest counterpart helped him realized that this isn't what his aunt would have wanted. Also, Parker decided to cure Osborn as he understood that his actions wasn't his fault and is his friend who needed his help. Despite this, Parker, out of anger and hatred for Green Goblin, didn't give a cured Osborn an answer as to what he has done. In addition, Parker's close bond with his friends, Stark and aunt was his inspiration to carry on as Spider-Man as he kept mementos and the wisdoms left by them, even though he lost some of them or they have forgotten about him.\nThrough his growing relationship with Stark, Parker realized that he would have to let his closest friends and aunt in on his double life as Spider-Man, as he cares and trusts them to keep it a secret. Also, once he comes to trust one of his fellow superheroes, Parker would reveal his identity to them, such as when he met Doctor Strange, who he formed a genuine friendship with, and \nCaptain Marvel\n. Unfortunately, ever since the events with Mysterio and the latter revealed his identity as Spider-Man to the world, Parker lost faith in trusting people and would't open up to anyone that isn't close to him. Parker's faith in trusting people became worse, after Green Goblin killed his aunt. However, through his counterparts and Octavius' help, Parker was convinced to not give up on trusting people and to have faith in them. Although, despite his regained faith and trust in people, Parker made the decision to avoid everyone, including his friends, allies and fellow superheroes, so he won't lose anyone else like he lost Stark and his aunt, believing that being around him was not only too risky but also would put someone else closes to him in harms way.\nUpon meeting his alternate selves, Parker dismissed them at first, but \nMichelle Jones\n convinced him to hear them out. After finding out that their own actions and mistakes caused the deaths of their loved ones, Parker empathized with his counterparts. Also, once he got to know his counterparts, Parker formed a close bond with them and comes to see them as older brothers. Parker was even impressed that his older counterpart created cures to help the villains and his oldest counterpart also fought an \nalien villain\n. Parker was also amazed that his oldest counterpart can produce organic webbing as he and their alternate self curiously asked him how it worked later on. In addition, Parker was surprised that there weren't other superheroes like the Avengers in his counterparts' universes. Parker even values his alternate selves' safety, as seen when he checked on his oldest counterpart, after he had been injured by Green Goblin.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.\"\n\"Hence the name.\"\n\"Gross. Does he look like a spider?\"\n\"No. No. More like a man.\"\n\"Climbs walls. Shoots webs.\"\n\nDoctor Strange\n, \nWong\n and \nAmerica Chavez\n[src]\nSpider Physiology\n: After Peter Parker was bitten by a spider, he gained the proportionate physical capabilities of a spider. With his newfound heightened abilities, Parker deliberately holds back from participating in sports to avoid being suspicious, such as football due to having a superhuman advantage. Despite his restrictions, Parker is still shown to be athletic and even received commendation from Coach \nAndre Wilson\n for his participation in \nCaptain America's Fitness Challenge\n.\nSuperhuman Strength\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man holding up an airport platform\n \n \n Spider-Man possesses considerable superhuman strength, due to it being the proportional strength of a spider. Although he is relatively untrained, his strength alone is sufficient enough to catch a 1.5-ton car that was moving at 40 miles an hour when it was just inches away from hitting a bus, and he claimed to \nNed Leeds\n to be able to move a bus with his bare hands. He was also able to casually overpower \nWinter Soldier\n and his \nmetal arm\n, pushed Captain America to his limits for a prolonged period of time, breakthrough a bulletproof glass window with only a few blows, lift up rows of school lockers, slightly topple a gigantic \nAnt-Man\n, as well as to support the weight of a jet bridge, and was even able to lift a considerable portion of concrete roof that \nVulture\n had collapsed on top of him, though both feats visibly strained him. During the \nBlack Order\n's arrival in New York, Parker was able to catch \nCull Obsidian\n's hammer moments before it struck \nIron Man\n, and swing a car at Cull Obsidian. His strength is sufficient enough to stagger \nThanos\n, though he was outmatched and subdued swiftly when facing the Mad Titan on his own. Parker's strength helped him overcome \nMysterio\n's drones. He was able to punch and kick through them with ease while simultaneously dismembering mechanical components to use them to his advantage in a sophisticated fashion. He was able to hold and slightly pull together a Ferry cruise boat before Iron Man come to assist him. During the \nAmbush in Berlin\n, he punched a depression into a concrete wall. Peter can also easily hold the case containing his suit with one arm, whereas a grown man like \nHappy Hogan\n struggled to lift it up with both arms. His incredible strength also allowed him to knock out \nFlash Thompson\n with only a slap even though he was completely unintentional. Parker was able to viciously and relentlessly hit \nGreen Goblin\n, staggering him with each blow and knocking him to the ground, as well as lifting him up completely and slamming him down with considerable force.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man withstanding a \nPumpkin Bomb\n \n \n Spider-Man's body is inhumanly resistant towards impact forces and blunt force trauma, as he has taken a punch from Winter Soldier and a spinning air kick from \nCaptain America\n without any serious injuries. Additionally, Spider-Man easily endured a collision with a metal beam while being dragged by \nFalcon\n's \nRedwing\n flying at full force and a strike from \nCaptain America's Shield\n, as well as being backhanded by a gigantic \nAnt-Man\n, falling unharmed from several stories in the process. Parker only sustained a black eye from the entire \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n and was able to pass it off as a result of bullies at school while telling his \nAunt May\n. Moreover, Spider-Man survived being dragged from a speeding van and endured hits from garbage bins and stacks of bricks, withstand multiple blows from the \nShocker's Gauntlet\n unharmed, as well as \nVulture\n collapsing a considerable portion of a concrete roof on top of him and getting rammed, punched, and slammed multiple times from \nVultures Exo Suit\n, with only minor injuries. Parker was even able to withstand a blow from the tremendously strong Thanos while wearing the \nIron Spider Armor\n. However, according to \nKaren\n, even Spider-Man would most likely not survive a fall from the top of the \nWashington Monument\n. He later survived a plane crash and a fall from the inside of an elevator shaft while only being incapacitated, which he recovered from faster than a human would. While Spider-Man followed \nEbony Maw\n's chase for \nDoctor Strange\n and the \nTime Stone\n, Parker was unfazed by the various objects flung at him by Maw, even shaking off a direct collision with a billboard, resuming his pursuit. Parker could endure a car being blasted at him from a \ncombat drone\n as well as a missile with mild discomfort. Parker was also able to survive a high speed train heading towards him, and manage to survive with only minor injuries and mildly nauseated, though he did require some of his injuries be stitched up by Happy Hogan. Despite this, he was able to function at full capacity, enough to battle a multitude of Mysterio's drones with his great agility and strength. He was also able to resist all the blows that Green Goblin had inflicted on him at Happy's apartment. During the same battle, Parker was able to withstand the deathly explosion of a \nPumpkin Bomb\n at point-black range, with only a few broken ribs and other minor injuries.\nSuperhuman Speed\n: Spider-Man can run and move much faster than an ordinary human and is adept at dodging quickly. Spider-Man was also quick enough to catch up to a speeding vehicle on foot. His speed has allowed him to casually catch the Winter Soldier's bionic arm before it could even punch him. During the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Spider-Man was able to easily outrun both \nBlack Widow\n and \nBlack Panther\n and avoid \nWanda Maximoff\n's telekinetic attacks, as well as dodge many of the blasts fired at him by \nStar-Lord\n when he fought him on \nTitan\n and dodge rapid gunfire from \nMysterio\n's horde of \ncombat drones\n. One time, Spider-Man was able to run across an entire golf course and was still able to get to the crime site in time to try to stop the \nShocker\n.\nSuperhuman Agility\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man dodging a car thrown at him\n \n \n After Spider-Man gained his powers, he became as agile as a spider, being able to make movements that would be extremely difficult for a normal human with great facility, capable of swinging around on thin spider-webbing and jumping great distances and heights without difficulty. His bones, muscles, and joints have more elastic strength and durability, allowing him to perform gymnastic and contortionist maneuvers without damaging his bone structure. Spider-Man can leap much higher than a normal human, enabling him the ability to jump and leap to a height of several stories in a single bound, and easily capable of jumping and leaping from one building over a street to the next. He used his agility to outmaneuver and beat both Winter Soldier and Falcon, dodge most of Vulture's attacks and even dodge the many cars that \nWanda Maximoff\n telekinetically hurled at him. Spider-Man's mobility was proven to be beneficial for going up against opponents such as Cull Obsidian and Thanos. It was also extremely favorable during Parker's swift movement to prevent a large amount of debris from falling upon civilians during \nHydro-Man\n's attack on \nVenice\n, as well as his graceful traversal around the city to meet up with his love interest, \nMichelle Jones\n. Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow. He could easily have done a back flip when a car was thrown behind him by \nDoctor Octopus\n.\nSuperhuman Stamina\n: Spider-Man could exert his maximum energy for long periods of time. He \nfought\n the \nAvengers\n for a long time and only stopped when he was forced to by \nIron Man\n. He \nbattled\n \nVulture\n directly after hanging onto a plane and also exerting his force in order to turn the whole plane away from buildings. He even fought \nGreen Goblin\n and \nLizard\n at the same time while getting thrown through multiple floors of a building. He then battled the same two villains along with \nSandman\n and \nElectro\n not even 24 hours later.\nSuperhuman Reflexes\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man dodging all of drones' gunfire\n \n \n On several occasions, it has been shown that Spider-Man possesses reflexes far beyond the capabilities of normal humans. In conjunction with his Spider-Sense, Parker is able to easily dodge full auto gunfire in point blank range from numerous invisible drones with his eyes closed during his battle with Mysterio. Spider-Man also possesses a heightened sense of equilibrium which greatly enhances his balance and coordination.\nEnhanced Senses\n: Spider-Man's senses are greatly enhanced, with him describing them as being \"dialed to eleven\". Hence, Parker is able to sense potentially dangerous things shortly before they occur. For example, if an object is being thrown at Spider-Man, he will usually be aware of it, even if it is hurled from far away and he is facing the opposite direction. His senses are so developed that before mastering his own powers, he was forced to reduce his sensorial input by wearing dark goggles to prevent it from handicapping him in a battle.\nSpider-Sense\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker sensing danger\n \n \n Spider-Man has shown an extrasensory awareness of impending danger,\n[\n14\n]\n known as his \"Spider-Sense,\" a sixth sense, \"Peter-Tingle\"\n[\n3\n]\n or simply \"tingle.\"\n[\n5\n]\n His brain intakes and responses to stimuli at an accelerated rate, acting as a precognitive ability to sense potential or immediate danger. This awareness thus implies some kind of intelligence, capable of parsing Spider-Man's surroundings, identifying and critically evaluating a potential threat at a subconscious level, thus alerting Spider-Man of dangers he cannot readily notice at first, allowing him to effectively dodge and counter incoming attacks in combat, including projectiles aimed at him even from a blind spot. Provided with his extraordinary speed and wall-crawling, the Spider-Sense is sufficiently well-linked to his superhuman kinesthetics and reflexes, and it permits Spider-Man to evade all manner of spontaneous dangers by an evidently instinctual exercise of some uncanny reflex. It also gives him omnipresent detection to his surroundings, which is how he web swings without looking where he shoots his webs with ease. This was also demonstrated when Parker was able to catch the small cartridge of web fluid tossed to him by \nTony Stark\n, even though he was facing away from him. This ability also doesn't seem to work on individuals Parker doesn't subconsciously consider threats, like his Aunt May. During the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, he sensed the bench that Winter Soldier had hurled at him while he fought Falcon. During the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n, he sensed someone coming his way and, without looking, incapacitated him with a web grenade. Later, he was also able to dodge \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n at full speed, effectively maneuvering in close quarters at a high rate of speed. However, as his enhanced reflexes directly correspond to his sensory input, he can be rendered vulnerable to attacks if his senses are overloaded, such as during his \nfinal fight\n with Vulture. Spider-Man also, despite his incredible reflexes, can be caught by surprise should he allow himself to get distracted, as seen when he was ensnared by Redwing's grapple line due to his excitement during the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport. While on a bus during a field trip, Parker was able to sense Ebony Maw's \nQ-Ship\n descending on \nNew York City\n, despite being miles away from the site. He is also susceptible to attacks if he does not have sufficient time to elude the attack. After crash-landing the Q-Ship on \nTitan\n, Spider-Man was able to sense a threat was going to happen before warning Iron Man and Doctor Strange. His senses had also warned him of his impending demise at the hands of Thanos moments before he began to fade away. When Parker was attempting to explain that \nMysterio\n is a fraud, he sensed the presence of imminent danger, before it physically appeared. Furthermore, Parker's Spider-Sense outwardly possesses a directional component and can guide him to or away from concealed danger and disguised enemies, such as using his senses to elegantly dodge and attack the invisible \nStark Industries Combat Drones\n that were heading towards him. After Spider-Man defeated all of the drones, when Mysterio gestured the glasses to him, his senses warned him of the real Mysterio cloaked beside him with a gun to his head, allowing him to anticipate Beck's murder attempt, and countered immediately. He was able to react and prepare to catch a brick hurled into the Parker Residence towards him, though \nMatt Murdock\n was able to catch it first due to him being closer to the window. His awareness is so powerful that, even when Strange separated him from his physical form, his body reacted to keep the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n away from him. His Spider-Sense was also visible around his astral form's head. Parker was able to sense when \nGreen Goblin\n took over Osborn, having honed his Spider-Sense to the point that it went into overdrive, with all surrounding voices drowning out and allowing him to focus, being able to hear the heartbeats of everyone in the room. He was even able to sense that whatever threat was upon him would eventually kill Aunt May, as she was the first person that he worried about when his Spider-Sense got triggered, this ultimately was proven to be right. This has shown that not only was Parker able to sense danger coming towards others, mainly the ones he cared about, but also his precognitive ability ranged from a few seconds to more than a few minutes before the threat happened. Later, Parker and his two alternate versions were able to sense the villains arrival at the same time. Parker was also able to catch the Anti-Goblin Serum pitched to him by \nPeter-Three\n, even though he was facing away from him.\nRegenerative Healing Factor\n: Spider-Man's increased metabolism allows him to rapidly heal and regenerate from harm faster and more extensively than normal humans can recover from. He was able to rapidly heal from a black eye from Giant-Man in less than a day. After suffering multiple wounds from his fight with Vulture, Parker's scars were fully healed in a matter of hours. He similarly recovered in mere hours from many bruises and cuts he gained during the \nBattle of Earth\n, after the \nSanctuary II\n opened fire on the battlefield and then during \nMysterio's ambush\n on him, in which he was repeatedly attacked by Stark Industries Combat Drones disguised with holographic illusions and then being struck at full force by a speeding train after being lured into its path by the illusions. He was capable of healing several broken ribs from his fight with Green Goblin in a matter of hours.\nWallcrawling\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker climbing his \ngym\n wall\n \n \n Spider-Man can adhere to walls, ceilings, and other surfaces in order to scale them and has stated that he does not use any adhesive gloves or fabrics to do it. This ability allows him to stick to any surface when willing himself to, as physical contact with said surfaces creates a locking connection necessary to support his body, even when he is inverted above the ground. Alternatively, Parker could make individual portions of his body adhesive, which allowed him to stick his foot onto the chest of a bank robber to fling him into a wall. He was able to have a car stick onto his hand and easily lifting as well without required strong grip when fighting against armies of drones lead by Mysterio.\n\"Is \nthis stuff\n coming out of you?\"\n\nFalcon\n to Spider-Man\n[src]\nWeb Generation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man webbing up the power lines\n \n \n Through the use of his \nWeb-Shooters\n, Spider-Man is able to project a substance similar to a spider's web. The web's tensile strength and adhesive properties allow him to use the webs for a variety of purposes, from swinging between buildings to restraining his enemies. When \nDoctor Strange\n temporarily enchanted his \nWeb-Shooters\n with eldritch magic, Parker was able to shoot webs that teleported people and objects to the \nSanctum Sanctorum\n's undercroft, as he used the new upgrades to apprehend \nElectro\n and \nSandman\n and teleport them to the secret hideout.\nFormer Powers\n[\n]\n\"Activate Instant-Kill.\"\nSpider-Man\n[src]\nIron Spider Armor\n Capabilities\n: When recruited by \nIron Man\n, Parker was gifted with an armor that is similar to Iron Man's. Although he originally turned it down, he used it during the \nBattle of Titan\n, \nBattle of Earth\n, and the \nBattle at the Alexander Hamilton Bridge\n. The armor is made of nano-technology that forms around Parker's body in order to protect him. Parker was also able to control \nDoctor Octopus\n' \ntentacles\n through his armor's interface. The armor has since been merged into his \nParker Suit\n by \nDoctor Octopus\n.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: The armor gives Spider-Man even more durability than his enhanced body has. With the armor, he was able to withstand punches and attacks by none other than \nThanos\n. It is also bulletproof, being able to withstand the high caliber weaponry used by the \nManfredi Crime Family\n. Nevertheless, the nano-bots can be ripped off with enough force. When Spider-Man battled \nDoctor Octopus\n, the latter used a spike and his \nTentacles\n to rip off the nano-bots and leave Parker compromised.\nMechanical Limb Generation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man with his spider-legs\n \n \n The armor contains four extra legs with sharp ends that can be used to attack the enemy or stab into the ground in order to keep Spider-Man's balance or footing. These spider-legs were able to hold \nThanos\n at bay, with the help of allies, so that they could try to get the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n off of his hand, and could combat the pull of the vacuum caused by a hull breach. They were deployed to control his descent after catching \nMantis\n in mid-air during the \nBattle of Titan\n, and previously deployed to stop him and \nDoctor Strange\n from being ejecting out of \nEbony Maw\n's \nQ-Ship\n. During the \nBattle of Earth\n the spider-legs were used as offensive weapons when Spider-Man activated instant-kill mode to protect himself from a horde of \nOutriders\n, piercing and killing several of the creatures with ease. Parker also used the legs in a battle against \nDoctor Octopus\n. When he was thrown into a car, he used the legs to cut a hole into the roof and climb his way out.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"Peter, you don't need to study. You're, like, the smartest guy I've ever met.\"\n\nLiz Allan\n to Peter Parker\n[src]\nGenius-Level Intellect\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker creating his own \nsuit\n \n \n Parker is a highly intelligent science enthusiast, with aptitudes in chemistry, physics, and engineering. His intellect was praised by some of the smartest people in the world such as \nTony Stark\n himself (who considered him a candidate for \nMIT\n) and \nQuentin Beck\n (who described Parker as \"smart as a whip\"). In addition, Parker was a valued member of the \nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n academic decathlon team, with \nLiz Allan\n claiming that Parker was its most intelligent member and strongest asset in physics and his other teammates being distressed when he briefly dropped out of the team. Parker is also an intellectual rival of \nFlash Thompson\n, whom he often effortlessly upstaged in class. Parker is also well-read and good at math, claiming to have \"nailed\" an algebra test the day Stark recruited him. He managed to swiftly calculate geometrical patterns within the \nMirror Dimension\n to outmaneuver \nDoctor Strange\n and trap him. \nNorman Osborn\n offered him a position at Oscorp due to his high intelligence and knowledge in various fields.\nMaster Scientist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker concocting web fluid\n \n \n Parker is a brilliant scientist who is highly skilled in various fields of science. He developed a highly advanced chemical compound into a \nsilk-like material\n (the sophistication of which even impressed \nTony Stark\n), using salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate to make it sticky, malleable, load-bearing, strong, hold with extreme amounts of tension and stress, yet have a little stretch to it.\n[\n18\n]\n He later quickly deduced the composition of \nFalcon\n's \nwings\n based on their relationship between rigidity and flexibility, despite only witnessing their usage in a short span of time. Parker also has knowledge in physics; he was able to quickly solve a physics problem (calculating linear acceleration between points A and B) with just a glance at the board and is well-versed in the \nmultiverse\n theory, comprehending that it changes how humans understand the initial singularity due to an eternal inflation system. Parker has two gold medal science awards from his sophomore and junior years of high school. Through the use of his scientific knowledge, Parker was able to successfully create a chemical mixture that undid the mutation of \nSandman\n, permanently curing him of his sand-like appearance. However, he failed to cure \nGreen Goblin\n with the first \nAnti-Goblin Serum\n, as it was still in the process of being made by the \nStark Industries Fabricator\n.\nExpert Engineer\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker and \nNorman Osborn\n create the cure\n \n \n Parker has an affinity for working on and building computers, and has become an expert when it comes to creating new technology. As such, he constructed his own \nweb-shooters\n with over-the-counter materials\n[\n18\n]\n along with his first \nSpider-Man Suit\n and goggles. Furthermore, when deprived of his former suits, Parker managed to take for himself all of Stark's previous designs to create a suit of his own using Stark technology, which caused \nHappy Hogan\n to smile as it reminded him of Stark's engineering genius. Parker also quickly understands how to utilize artificial intelligence to his advantage, as his performance with \nKaren\n led Stark to entrust him with \nE.D.I.T.H.\n, a multi-billion-dollar augmented reality tactical intelligence system, and he knew how to use his Iron Spider suit to manipulate Doctor Octopus' tentacles. He later fabricated a neural inhibitor chip for \nDoctor Octopus\n' \nmechanical arms\n using the \nStark Industries Fabricator\n.\n\"All we gotta do is focus, trust your tingle, and coordinate our attacks, okay?\"\nSpider-Man to \nSpider-Man\n and \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nExpert Tactician\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man leading his counterparts\n \n \n Parker draws from pop culture when formulating strategies, notably when he let \nIron Man\n and \nWar Machine\n know of his plan to tie up \nAnt-Man\n's legs, after which they knocked the immobilized giant down. In a similar fashion, Parker devised a plan to rescue \nDoctor Strange\n from \nEbony Maw\n by ejecting him out of his \nQ-Ship\n through a hull breach. He also uses the laws of physics to his advantage, such as when he used the lift from a SWAT team's helicopter blades to his advantage to get enough momentum to break a window in order to save his classmates. Parker is still relatively inexperienced, however, since he asked Iron Man for advice during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, and later consistently asked for \nKaren\n's assistance in taking down \nVulture\n and his gang. Following his battles in space against the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos, as well as the battle for Earth, Parker seems to have grown in this ability in the eight months following Stark's sacrifice, being able to fight against the highly intelligent \nMysterio\n, circumventing his illusions and ultimately stopping his plans. He swiftly made a plan to coordinate himself and the other two Spider-Men during the battle at \nStatue of Liberty\n.\n\"The craziest thing just happened. I just had a fight with \nCaptain America\n. I stole his shield. I threw it at him.\"\nSpider-Man\n[src]\nMaster Combatant\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man fighting against \nGreen Goblin\n \n \n After fighting crime for six months, Parker's combat style developed into a somewhat instinctive and improvised collection of techniques that emphasizes the use of his superhuman strength, speed, agility, and Web-Shooters. Hence, Parker uses quick, powerful attacks and agile movements while firing his webs to immobilize his enemies. However, Parker is not skilled in martial arts as his style is self-taught and he often gets distracted while in combat. Despite his inexperience, Spider-Man easily defeated both Falcon and \nWinter Soldier\n, two military-trained hand-to-hand combatants, as well as temporarily held his own against the far more experienced \nCaptain America\n; according to Iron Man, however, Rogers was holding back during that fight and could have beaten Parker easily. Parker also fought against \nVulture\n despite the latter repeatedly besting him in combat. Because of his limited experience, Parker was easily subdued by \nShocker\n during their brawl due to him heavily relying on his Web-Shooters for offensive attacks. Later on, Parker had somewhat improved his skills but remained vastly outclassed by experienced fighters, as shown when he and his allies fought the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n and later when he briefly fought \nThanos\n. While Parker was able to briefly duel the highly skilled \nStar-Lord\n, he was quickly subdued by the latter's equipment. Due to his predictable combat style during the \nBattle of Titan\n, Thanos defeated Spider-Man in moments after recognizing his attack pattern, but nevertheless Parker managed to stagger him. Furthermore, during the \nBattle of Earth\n, Parker was capable of handling group fights with each incoming attack but despite activating the Instant-Kill mode in his suit, he was easily overwhelmed by the sheer number of \nOutriders\n that were called for assistance. After the Battle of Earth, Parker seems to have improved as a fighter, but still relied heavily on the \nIron Spider Armor\n, as seen when he went against the \nManfredi Crime Family\n. Against \nMysterio\n and his army of \ndrones\n, Parker opted to rely on his physical abilities to best him, also taking full advantage of his superior senses and early awareness of danger. He demonstrated further prowess in hand-to-hand combat and grappling against \nGreen Goblin\n. He was able to beat Green Goblin by utilizing his webs to get him closer and then punching him until he was down.\n\"Keep your distance, web them up.\"\n\nIron Man\n to Spider-Man\n[src]\nMaster Marksman\n: Spider-Man possesses extremely keen eyesight, and is able to accurately utilize his Web-Shooters to neutralize his targets during his crime-fighting. He was capable of simultaneously ensnaring Captain America's hands and strip him of his shield, mid-air, executing it all at high speed. Parker was also able to precisely shoot a \nSpider-Tracer\n onto \nHerman Schultz\n's foot across a classroom, and ensnare and latch onto \nVulture's Exo-Suit\n with little effort despite the rig moving at incredible speeds at times, notably during the \nHijacking of the Stark Cargo Plane\n.\n\"I really don't know how you do this without throwing up.\"\n\nMichelle Jones\n to Spider-Man\n[src]\nMaster Acrobat\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man swinging in \nRockefeller Center\n \n \n Due to his superhuman agility, Spider-Man can perform acrobatic and gymnastic feats, such as flips, with little effort. Hence, he was able to accurately shoot a string of webbing at \nCaptain America's Shield\n, then caught it mid-air and land on a vehicle. Spider-Mans acrobatics make him a formidable opponent.\n[\n28\n]\n While wearing the \nIron Spider Armor\n, Parker's coordination is greatly enhanced, allowing him to easily navigate throughout the environment of \nTitan\n, rescuing \nMantis\n, \nStar-Lord\n, and \nDrax\n mid-air while swinging through the obstacles affected by the planet's gravitational distortions, as well as effortlessly dodge plasma blasts from an accomplished marksman like \nStar-Lord\n.\nPerformer\n: Parker took band classes at his school before dropping it to focus on his duties as Spider-Man.\n\"Cmo est tu hija?\n[\n29\n]\n\"\nPeter Parker to \nDelmar\n[src]\nMultilingualism\n: Parker is fluent in his native English, as well as some Spanish, studying the language in school with success and being able to understand enough to know a quip \nDelmar\n was making about his aunt, \nMay Parker\n, and then make his own quip about the deli owner's daughter. Parker also knows some Italian, as displayed in his text messages with \nNed Leeds\n before their trip to \nEurope\n[\n30\n]\n and when he accidentally spoke the language in \nPrague\n.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nWeapons\n[\n]\n\"You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.\"\n\nKaren\n to Spider-Man\n[src]\nWeb-Shooters\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker examining his new Web-Shooters\n \n \n A pair of wrist-mounted mechanical devices used by Spider-Man to project \nsynthetic webbing\n. Parker invented the first pair while \nTony Stark\n created a new and improved pair to go along with his new suit. Though, this new pair supplied by Stark merely involved technological improvements and a few new features while the overall mechanics and webbing itself Stark did not attempt to replace. The upgraded Web-Shooters come with selective web types and a laser targeting system for accuracy. Parker finds the amount of possible Web-Shooter combinations Stark included to be excessive.\nSynthetic Webbing\n: Created by Peter Parker himself, this web-like organic chemical substance is meant to emulate the silk created by the common spider, while its composition and tensile strength are substantial enough to greatly impress Tony Stark himself. This synthetic spider silk is used by Parker to help swing around \nNew York City\n, bind and tie up enemies, steal weapons, and make other useful applications. Spider-Man combines this synthetic web with agile movements to dodge enemy attacks and often targets the enemies' arms and legs to break their balance and immobilize them. The chemical compound was so durable that both \nCaptain America\n and \nWinter Soldier\n had trouble breaking it, despite their enhanced strength. Parker can also fabricate his web compound with ordinary school chemicals used while in chemistry classes. According to himself, the webs take about two hours to dissipate. The latest formula developed is his 3.01 version.\nSpider-Signal\n: A red light emitted from Spider-Man's web-shooters, which Tony Stark added much to Parker's surprise and delight.\nSpider-Tracer\n: A small tracker designed by \nTony Stark\n that resembles a spider. Parker planted the tracker on \nHerman Schultz\n and used it to track his gang's movements.\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\nSpider-Man Suit\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man's fresh start suit\n \n \n Parker originally wore a handmade suit while operating on the streets of \nNew York City\n. Nothing more than a red hoodie, blue sweats, and a pair of goggles, this suit was created with the intention to help Parker to conceal his identity and keep his superhuman senses in check. After he had \nDoctor Strange\n make his existence forgotten, Parker chose to ditch the Stark technology of his previous suits for a simpler and more homegrown approach, symbolic of his rebirth as an independent Spider-Man. The new spider emblem is also inspired by the other Peter Parkers' suits.\nFormer Equipment\n[\n]\n\"How'd you find me? You put a tracker in my suit or something?\"\n\"I put everything in your suit.\"\nSpider-Man and \nIron Man\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nSpider-Man's integrated suit\n \n \nStark\n \nSpider-Man Suits\n: Parker was given an upgraded and much more refined suit designed by \nTony Stark\n to better focus his superhuman senses, which also included moving eyepieces that resemble camera shutters to filter out stimuli while in use. After the Stark-made suit was destroyed during the \nBattle of London\n, Parker synthesized a new suit using Stark technology which featured upgrades from his previous suit. he was able to turn the suit inside-out to face \nElectro\n and \nSandman\n until May cleaned the paint stains, and he could wear it again to face \nDoctor Strange\n. The suit later received an upgrade from \nDoctor Octopus\n, who previously stole nanites from the \nIron Spider Armor\n to upgrade his \ntentacles\n, to create the integrated/hybrid suit.\nUtility Belt\n: The suit has a utility belt seamlessly integrated into it. It contains spare web fluid cartridges for Spider-Man's Web-Shooters.\nSpider-Drone\n: The spider emblem on the front of Parker's suit can detach and act as a reconnaissance device. It has a drone mode allowing it to fly onto a target for Parker to follow.\nGPS Tracking System\n: In his right Web-Shooter, Parker has access to the suit's GPS tracking system via a holographic display, allowing him to follow his Spider-Drone.\nKaren\n: After deactivating the \nTraining Wheels Protocol\n, Parker's suit now features an A.I. user interface program similar to \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n and \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n that provides diagnostic and tactical reports.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. Stealth Suit\n: Parker received this outfit while operating in Europe for \"\nNick Fury\n\". It allowed him to secretly operate as Spider-Man while away from home, and he gained the moniker of \"Night Monkey\" while he worked with \nMysterio\n to \"defeat\" the \nElementals\n.\nIron Spider Armor\n: Following his \nconfrontation\n with Vulture, \nTony Stark\n presented the newly created Iron Spider Armor for Parker to use as the newest member of the \nAvengers\n, but Parker declined the offer. After initially rejecting the suit, Parker was ultimately given the armor to help during his pursuit of a \nQ-Ship\n over New York City, and later during the \nBattle of Titan\n. The suit was composed of nanites, similarly to Tony Stark's \nlatest Iron Man suit\n, and was able to manifest four armored spider-legs from the rear spider symbol, which granted Spider-Man greater mobility and better grip on his surroundings. \nDoctor Octopus\n temporarily stole a portion of the nanites to upgrade his \ntentacles\n.\nMagic Enchanted Web-Shooter\n: Taking one web-shooter from the Iron Spider Armor, \nDoctor Strange\n enchants it with \nEldritch Magic\n so Parker can help him capture \"visitors\" from alternate realities. Anything that comes into contact with the eldritch magic-infused web will be transported to a cell in the dungeon of the \nNew York Sanctum\n. It is ineffective against noncorporeal entities, as the eldritch web phased through an \nElectro\n in pure energy form and connected with a tree instead. This feature was only temporarily as when Peter and Strange fought over how to do things, Strange took out the magic out of the nano web-shooter.\nJester Mask\n: During the \nBattle in the Grand Canal\n, Peter used a jester mask to hide his identity, after he left his suit in his hotel room, in order to help \nMysterio\n battle \nHydro-Man\n.\nTony Stark's Glasses\n: Following the death of \nTony Stark\n, Peter was given the glasses that Tony had previously used. Using these, Peter was given access to \nE.D.I.T.H.\n, an advanced A.I. designed by Stark, which gave Peter access to all the \nStark Industries\n databases and satellite system. Later on, these were confiscated by the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n.\nVehicles\n[\n]\nStark Industries Private Jet\n: After being recruited by \nTony Stark\n to assist his team in the fight against \nCaptain America\n's team during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Parker boarded the Stark Industries Private Jet to go to \nGermany\n to assist in the fight. Much later before his final battle with Mysterio, Peter is given access to the Private Jet, this time to build his own suit to his own specifications.\nQ-Ship\n: Parker and \nTony Stark\n broke into the Q-Ship to \nrescue\n \nDoctor Strange\n, who had been \nkidnapped\n by \nEbony Maw\n. Stark killed Maw by ejecting him into outer space and Parker saved Strange from being sucked out into space. The trio then used the ship to travel to \nTitan\n and stop \nThanos\n.\nFacilities\n[\n]\n\"I know you sneak out of this house every night. That's not fine.\"\n\nMay Parker\n to Peter Parker\n[src]\nParker Residence\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker goes inside his apartment home\n \n \n The Parker Residence is the apartment home to \nMay\n and Peter Parker. When \nTony Stark\n is required to bring \nCaptain America\n and his team into custody, Stark goes to Queens to recruit Parker. After Spider-Man's battle at the \nairport\n with the \nAvengers\n, Aunt May aided Parker's bruise in his room. When Spider-Man had returned home, \nNed Leeds\n had been inside of his room all along and had witnessed Parker crawling across the ceiling while wearing his \nSpider-Man Suit\n. Returning to the Residence, Parker and Leeds used the \nSpider-Tracer\n on \nShocker\n's boot to begin following the gang's current movements as they made their way outside of \nNew York City\n. After asking \nLiz Allan\n to go to homecoming with him, Parker returned to his home and asked Aunt May for her assistance. Once he returned home, Parker discovered that Stark had returned his suit, putting it on again, until Aunt May shockingly saw him wearing the suit.\nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nParker at his locker with \nNed Leeds\n \n \n Midtown School of Science and Technology is a high school that Parker and his best friend \nNed Leeds\n attend as students. It also had an Academic Decathlon Team that is managed by \nRoger Harrington\n and led by \nLiz Allan\n; only now appointed to \nMichelle Jones\n as the new team's captain. Parker took advantage of the school's equipment for his Spider-Man activity, using the chemistry labs to synthesize his \nweb fluid\n and hiding his \nhomemade suit\n below a series of lockers.\nKurhotel Strszek\n: The Kurhotel Strszek is a hotel in Germany that Parker had stayed in with Happy Hogan and Tony Stark before the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n. After the fight, Parker spent the night at the hotel before going home the next day. While in Germany and at the hotel, Parker made a \nvlog\n.\nHotel DeMatteis\n: Hotel DeMatteis is a hotel in Venice where Parker stayed in with his classmates during their trip before the subsequent appearances of \nHydro-Man\n and \nMysterio\n during the \nBattle in the Grand Canal\n.\nNick Fury's Hideout\n: Nick Fury's Hideout was built inside a drained canal conduit, and doubles as a base of operations used by \nNick Fury's Crew\n, situated in \nVenice\n, \nItaly\n. It was fitted into helping the Crew track down \nHydro-Man\n. This environment is also where Parker is introduced to \nQuentin Beck\n and Fury's accomplice \nDimitri Smerdyakov\n.\nNew York Sanctum\n: The Sanctum was visited by Parker who asked Strange to help him after his identity had been exposed. Parker went to the basement with him and watched as he performed the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n. After he messed it up, he was sent out of the Sanctum. Parker was later brought back to the Sanctum and was tasked with capturing the universe-displaced people and putting them in the Sanctum's chambers. To do so, \nNed Leeds\n and \nMichelle Jones\n were taken to the Sanctum where Parker met with them in the atrium and were sent by Strange to work in the undercroft. Parker left the Sanctum to accomplish his task and returned after he had finished. He left the Sanctum again to escape Strange with the \nMacchina de Kadavus\n and returned a final time via \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n, telling the universe-displaced about his plan to help them and transported them out of the Sanctum.\nHappy Hogan's Condominium\n: After his identity became exposed to the world, protesters threw a brick through a window of the previous Parker Residence which caused May and Peter to move somewhere more secure. That's when Happy Hogan invited them to live in his condominium that was equipped with state of the art Stark security system keeping them in welfare.\nPeter Parker's Apartment\n: An apartment rented out by Peter Parker, acting as his new home while retaining some belongings from the previous \nParker Residence\n. Following the successful recasting of \nStephen Strange\n's spell and the subsequent erasure of the world's knowledge of his civilian persona, Parker moved into a new apartment building away from \nQueens\n to begin living independently, also buying a sowing machine to stitch together a new Spider-Man suit in order to resume his heroics with his secret identity restored.\nRelationships\n[\n]\nFamily\n[\n]\nRichard Parker  - Father\nMary Parker  - Mother\nBen Parker\n  - Uncle\nMay Parker\n  - Aunt\nAllies\n[\n]\nMidtown School of Science and Technology\n - Former High School\nMorita\n - Former Principal\nRoger Harrington\n - Former Teacher\nMonica Warren\n - Former Teacher\nAndre Wilson\n - Former Teacher\nBarry Hapgood\n - Former Teacher\nCobbwell\n - Former Teacher\nJulius Dell\n - Former Teacher\nNed Leeds\n - Former Classmate and Former Best Friend\nMichelle Jones\n - Former Classmate, Decathlon Leader and Ex-Girlfriend\nBetty Brant\n - Former Classmate and Former Friend\nFlash Thompson\n - Former Classmate, Former Rival and Fan\nJason Ionello\n - Former Classmate\nJosh Searing\n - Former Classmate\nZach Cooper\n - Former Classmate\nYasmin Monette\n - Former Classmate\nTyler Corbyn\n - Former Classmate\nZoha Souliotis\n - Former Classmate\nSebastian Fedas\n - Former Classmate\nBrad Davis\n - Former Classmate and Former Rival\nLiz Allan\n - Former Classmate, Former Decathlon Leader and Former Love Interest\nSally Avril\n - Former Classmate\nSeymour O'Reilly\n - Former Classmate\nCharles Murphy\n - Former Classmate\nAbe Brown\n - Former Classmate\nCindy Moon\n - Former Classmate\nTiny McKeever\n - Former Classmate\nDelmar\nMurph\nKlev\n - Fan\nAvengers\n - Former Teammates and Friends\nTony Stark/Iron Man\n  - Idol, Mentor, and Savior\nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n - Idol, Temporary Enemy, and Former Leader\nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\n \nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nVision\n \nClint Barton/Hawkeye\n - Temporary Enemy\nWanda Maximoff\n  - Temporary Enemy\nSam Wilson/Falcon\n - Temporary Enemy\nScott Lang/Ant-Man\n - Temporary Enemy\nBruce Banner/Hulk\n - Resurrector\nThor\n - Idol\nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\n - Savior\nStark Industries\nPepper Potts/Rescue\nHappy Hogan\n - Former Friend\nBucky Barnes/Winter Soldier\n - Temporary Enemy\nKaren\n  - Former Assistant\nAaron Davis\nNew York City Police Department\nBristow\nClark\nMasters of the Mystic Arts\nStephen Strange/Doctor Strange\n - Former Friend and Temporary Enemy\nWong\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\n - Former Attempted Killer\nDrax the Destroyer\n - Temporary Enemy\nMantis\n - Temporary Enemy\nNebula\nGroot\nRocket\nGolden Tribe\nT'Challa/Black Panther\n \nShuri\nDora Milaje\nOkoye\nJabari Tribe\nM'Baku\nWakandan Royal Guard\nBorder Tribe\nBrunnhilde/Valkyrie\nWarsong\nKorg\nMiek\nEinherjar\nRavagers\nKraglin Obfonteri\nHoward the Duck\nHope van Dyne/Wasp\nGamora\nNick Fury's Crew\nTalos\n  \n(disguised as \nNick Fury\n)\nSoren\n  \n(disguised as \nMaria Hill\n)\nDimitri Smerdyakov\nS.H.I.E.L.D.\nSeamstress\nE.D.I.T.H.\n - Former Assistant and Temporary Enemy\nNelson, Murdock & Page\nMatt Murdock\n - Former Lawyer\nMIT Assistant Vice Chancellor\nOtto Octavius/Doctor Octopus\n - Former Enemy and Former Attempted Killer\nCurt Connors/Lizard\n - Former Enemy\nMax Dillon/Electro\n - Former Enemy\nFlint Marko/Sandman\n - Savior and Former Enemy\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\n - Alternate Self and Friend\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\n - Alternate Self and Friend\nEnemies\n[\n]\nHammer Drones\nEnforcers\nDaniel Brito/Fancy Dan\nRaymond Bloch/Ox\nCriminal Avengers\nAdrian Toomes' Crew\nAdrian Toomes/Vulture\n - Attempted Killer\nJackson Brice/Shocker\n  - Attempted Killer\nHerman Schultz/Shocker\n - Attempted Killer\nRandy Vale\nPhineas Mason/Tinkerer\nMetropolitan Police Department\n - Situational Enemies\nMac Gargan\nFBI\n - Situational Enemies\nBlack Order\nEbony Maw\n \nCull Obsidian\n  - Attempted Killer\nThanos\n  - Killer\nThanos\n \nBlack Order\nEbony Maw\n \nCull Obsidian\n \nProxima Midnight\n \nCorvus Glaive\n \nChitauri\nLeviathans\nChitauri Gorillas\nOutriders\nSakaarans\nManfredi Crime Family\nElementals\nHydro-Man\nMolten Man\nElemental Fusion\nQuentin Beck's Crew\nQuentin Beck/Mysterio\n  - Former Ally and Attempted Killer\nWilliam Ginter Riva\nVictoria\nGutes Guterman\nJanice\nDoug\nNetherlands Warden\nJ.

Upon the death of his uncle, \nBen Parker\n, due to Parker's indifference, he decided to become a selfless hero.\nOne of \nTony Stark\n's guesses as to Parker's superhero alias was \"Spiderling.\" In the comics, this name is used by Parker's daughter, \nAnnie Parker\n, on \nEarth-18119\n.\nParker's date of birth being August 10th is a reference to \nAmazing Fantasy Vol. 1 #15\n, the comic featuring the first appearance of Spider-Man, cover-dated August 10, 1962.\nParker is a fan of the indie rock bands \nAlt-J\n and \nLed Zeppelin\n listening to the former's song \"Left Hand Free\" prior to meeting Tony Stark and mentioning his love for the latter whilst forming the \nUpgraded Suit\n and listening to AC/DC.\nParker is a \nStar Wars\n fan and a \nLego\n collector. Parker has Star Wars action figures and Lego models of the \nDeath Star\n, a \nX-Wing fighter\n, and a \nAT-AT Walker\n. He also referenced \nThe Empire Strikes Back\n during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n.\nDespite this, at the time \nTom Holland\n claimed to not be a big \nStar Wars\n fan and had not seen \nthe\n \noriginal\n \ntrilogy\n, though he did enjoy \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\n and \nRogue One\n, as well as \nthe\n \nprequel\n \ntrilogy\n when he was a child.\n[\n31\n]\nParker is a fan of the \nNew York Mets\n.\nParker's school locker is #1184.\nSpider-Man is one of three superheroes who defeated the main antagonist of their first standalone movie without any assistance, the other two being \nHulk\n and \nAnt-Man\n.\nSpider-Man is the second superhero to star in two solo films in the same \nphase\n, with the first being \nIron Man\n.\nParker began his sophomore year of high school in \n2016\n, meaning he was originally set to graduate in \n2019\n prior to the \nSnap\n. Following the \nBlip\n, he was set to graduate in \n2025\n due to everyone having to repeat his junior year of high school, before everyone's memories of him were erased and forcing him to earn his GED.\nIn the comics, a version inspired of MCU Spider-Man appeared in \nSpider-Verse #3\n and in \nSpider-Geddon\n #5 as part of the Spider-Army assembled to fight the Inheritors led by the Earth-616's Spider-Man.\nSpider-Man is listed as one of the default names on \nThe Avengers: Skrull Takedown\n'\ns high score screen.\nBehind the Scenes\n[\n]\nSpider-Man was first indirectly referenced in an alternate version of the \npost-credits scene\n for \nIron Man\n, in which \nNick Fury\n mentioned to \nTony Stark\n about \"radioactive bug bites\" on the \"bigger universe\" he has become part. This version ultimately went unused from the finished film, likely because \nSony Pictures Entertainment\n owns the film rights of Spider-Man.\n[\n32\n]\nJoss Whedon\n wanted to include Spider-Man at the end of \nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n, but was unable to do so because the deal with \nSony Pictures Entertainment\n had yet to be completed during filming.\n[\n33\n]\nTom Holland\n made audition tapes together with \nJon Bernthal\n while filming \nPilgrimage\n, both landing their roles of Peter Parker and \nFrank Castle\n respectively.\n[\n34\n]\nTom Holland\n learned that he had been cast as Spider-Man on \nInstagram\n: \n\"I was actually having a really bad day, and I found out on Instagram. I was in my bed, I was scrolling through Instagram, and Marvel had posted a photo of Spider-Man. It said, 'Go to our website, and find out who it is'. I opened the screen, and then it said my name, and I went nuts.\"\n[\n35\n]\nDuring his audition, Tom Holland mentioned that \nRobert Downey Jr.\n gave him advice, saying \"\nListen, I remember my screen test for Iron Man. I remember how terrified I was. Just think of it as an audition. It's nothing too scary. If you get it wrong, we'll just start again. No pressure.\n.\"\nMax Favreau\n, the son of \nJon Favreau\n, had a role as an \"Expo Kid\" in \nIron Man 2\n which was later retconned as a young Peter Parker.\nIn an interview with the \nHuffington Post\n, Holland confirmed that the child that \nIron Man\n rescues from the \nHammer Drones\n in \nIron Man 2\n was, in fact, Peter Parker after \"literally\" having conversation with \nMarvel Studios\n President \nKevin Feige\n \"only 20 minutes ago.\" \nJon Watts\n revealed in an interview with \nUproxx\n that the boy retroactively revealed to be Parker was portrayed by \nJon Favreau\n's son, \nMax Favreau\n.\n[\n11\n]\nSpider-Man in the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n is the sixth live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by \nDanny Seagren\n, \nNicholas Hammond\n, \nShinji Td\n, \nTobey Maguire\n and \nAndrew Garfield\n.\nUnlike previous incarnations, this Spider-Man's agility and athleticism were performed by actor Tom Holland due to his history in dance and gymnastics, thereby allowing a majority of the stunts to be produced practically and without CGI.\nTom Holland mentioned that he has signed on for three Spider-Man movies and three other Marvel films, bringing a total of six films in his contract.\nAsa Butterfield\n, \nCharlie Rowe\n, \nJudah Lewis\n, \nMatt Lintz\n and \nCharlie Plummer\n were the final contenders for Spider-Man with Rowe being the runner-up for the role. Lintz would later be cast as \nBruno Carrelli\n in \nMs. Marvel\n.\nIn \nCaptain America: Civil War\n, Spider-Man kicks but never punches. Holland noted it was a conscious decision to emphasize Parker's age: \"\nEvery decision we make on set is based off, 'How would a kid react in this situation?' so every fight scene we have is designed in a way that's almost child-friendly, so he never actually punches anyone. It's all done [by him] kind of by accident.\n\"\n[\n36\n]\nIn the Italian dubbing of the \nIron Fist\n episode \nEight Diagram Dragon Palm\n, \nWard Meachum\n mentions Spider-Man when he compares \nDanny Rand\n's scaling of a building, instead of \nDaredevil\n.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nSpider-Man is mentioned in the \nWu-Tang Clan\n song \"\nProtect Ya Neck\n,\" which is featured in \nThe Defenders\n episode \nThe Defenders\n.\n[\n39\n]\nThis version of Parker served as one of the inspirations for one of the Spider-Men featured in the \nSony Pictures Animation\n film \nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n.\n[\n40\n]\n There were also plans to include Holland's Spider-Man in an scene which would have featured him alongside Maguire's and Garfield's versions of the character, but the scene was scrapped due to fears it would have been far too convoluted.\n[\n41\n]\n Holland's Spider-Man would have appeared at a train station where he would have greeted Miles Morales while walking through the background as an \nEaster egg\n, but the scene was cut.\n[\n42\n]\nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n showrunner \nMalcolm Spellman\n stated in an interview with \nInverse\n that there were plans to include Spider-Man in the \nfirst season\n finale \"\nOne World, One People\n\", as the episode takes place in \nNew York City\n, but \nKevin Feige\n convinced him to not include Spidey because he didn't belong to the story in an organic way.\n[\n43\n]\nMarvin Ross\n, \nHolland Diaz\n, \nDanny Downey\n, \nDavid Elson\n, \nAlrik Kreemke\n, \nChris Silcox\n, \nChristian Peden\n, \nLuke Scott\n, \nGreg Townley\n and \nJohn Flanagan\n were stunt doubles for \nTom Holland\n in the role of Spider-Man.\nDiaz and Elson were both stunt doubles for previous cinematic incarnations of Spider-Man. Diaz doubled for \nTobey Maguire\n in \nSpider-Man 3\n and Elson doubled for \nAndrew Garfield\n in \nThe Amazing Spider-Man\n.\nIan Kyle Findley\n, \nFreddy Parkington\n, and \nShane Hibbard\n were stand-ins for \nTom Holland\n in the role of Spider-Man.\nSpider-Man, \nBlack Panther\n, and \nBlack Widow\n are the only characters in the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n to receive a solo movie following their debut.\nSpider-Man is one of the three main protagonists who are able to defeat the main antagonist without assistance in the \nMCU\n, the others being the \nHulk\n, \nAnt-Man\n,  and \nDeadpool\n and \nWolverine\n in all of their titular films. So far, he has been the only one to do it more than once.\nThis version of the character is featured in the post-credit scene of \nVenom: Let There Be Carnage\n which ties into the ending of \nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n.\n[\n44\n]\nHe was also mentioned in the post-credit scene of \nMorbius\n which ties into the ending of \nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n.\n[\n45\n]\nThis version of Spider-Man is mentioned in the \nSony Pictures Animation\n film \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n.\n[\n46\n]\n Co-director \nKemp Powers\n later clarified in an interview with SFX, however, that Miguel O'Hara's mention of Spider-Man was merely a reference to \nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n that \nPhil Lord and Christopher Miller\n came up with as a tongue-in-cheek joke acknowledging the \nSpider-Man\n character's history.\n[\n47\n]\nReferences\n[\n]\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of images and media related to \nSpider-Man\n.\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of quotes related to \nSpider-Man\n.\n\n \nMarvel x Sony Agreement\n \n2.0\n \n2.1\n \n2.2\n \n2.3\n \n2.4\n \n2.5\n \n2.6\n \n2.7\n \nCaptain America: Civil War\n \n3.00\n \n3.01\n \n3.02\n \n3.03\n \n3.04\n \n3.05\n \n3.06\n \n3.07\n \n3.08\n \n3.09\n \n3.10\n \n3.11\n \n3.12\n \n3.13\n \n3.14\n \n3.15\n \n3.16\n \n3.17\n \n3.18\n \n3.19\n \n3.20\n \n3.21\n \n3.22\n \n3.23\n \nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n \n4.00\n \n4.01\n \n4.02\n \n4.03\n \n4.04\n \n4.05\n \n4.06\n \n4.07\n \n4.08\n \n4.09\n \n4.10\n \n4.11\n \n4.12\n \n4.13\n \n4.14\n \n4.15\n \n4.16\n \n4.17\n \n4.18\n \n4.19\n \n4.20\n \n4.21\n \n4.22\n \n4.23\n \n4.24\n \n4.25\n \n4.26\n \n4.27\n \n4.28\n \n4.29\n \n4.30\n \n4.31\n \n4.32\n \n4.33\n \n4.34\n \n4.35\n \n4.36\n \n4.37\n \nSpider-Man: Homecoming\n \n5.00\n \n5.01\n \n5.02\n \n5.03\n \n5.04\n \n5.05\n \n5.06\n \n5.07\n \n5.08\n \n5.09\n \n5.10\n \n5.11\n \n5.12\n \n5.13\n \n5.14\n \n5.15\n \n5.16\n \n5.17\n \n5.18\n \n5.19\n \n5.20\n \n5.21\n \n5.22\n \n5.23\n \n5.24\n \n5.25\n \n5.26\n \n5.27\n \nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n \n6.0\n \n6.1\n \n6.2\n \nthedailybugle.net\n Website\n\n \nPeter Parker's Passport\n \n8.0\n \n8.1\n \n8.2\n \n8.3\n \n8.4\n \n8.5\n \n8.6\n \n8.7\n \nAvengers: Infinity War\n\n \n4/30/2018 on Scott's laptop in \nAnt-Man and the Wasp\n\n \nMarvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline\n \n11.0\n \n11.1\n \n11.2\n \nSpider-Man: Homecoming director confirms Peter Parker's Iron Man 2 cameo\n \n12.0\n \n12.1\n \n'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Producer Amy Pascal Reveals More About the Historic Film and Confirms Tom Holland's Future as Spider-Man\n\n \nSpider-Man Needs to Be White and Straight, Say Leaked Sony Emails\n \n14.0\n \n14.1\n \nSpider-Man -
