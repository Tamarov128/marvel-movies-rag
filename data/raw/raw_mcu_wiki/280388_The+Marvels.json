But unintended consequences see Carol shouldering the burden of a destabilized universe. When her duties send her to an anomalous \nwormhole\n linked to a \nKree revolutionary\n, her powers become entangled with that of \nJersey City\n super-fan \nKamala Khan\n, aka Ms. Marvel, and Carol's estranged niece, now \nS.A.B.E.R.\n astronaut Captain \nMonica Rambeau\n. Together, this unlikely trio must team up and learn to work in concert to save the universe as \"The \nMarvels\n\".\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nMonica Rambeau\n inspects the \njump point\n \n \nKree\n Supremor \nDar-Benn\n comes across a \nQuantum Band\n, which she equips, and her newfound power creates ripples across the fabric of space, creating a web of interconnected \nJump Points\n that disrupt the essence of interstellar travel. The resulting anomaly affects the entire jump point network, including one near \nEarth\n's \nS.A.B.E.R. Space Station\n run by \nNick Fury\n. As \nMonica Rambeau\n investigates disturbances near the station, \nCarol Danvers\n pursues the newly opened Jump Point created by Dar-Benn. Touching their respective jump points, Rambeau finds herself displaced, along with Danvers and \nKamala Khan\n, the owner of the second Quantum Band on Earth who was biding her time in the creation of a story involving her superhero alter-ego Ms. Marvel and Danvers. The trio utilizes their distinct light-based powers to fend off Kree enemies, resulting in the destruction of the \nKhan family home\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nRambeau\n, \nMs. Marvel\n, and \nCaptain Marvel\n confront \nDar-Benn\n \n \nAfter returning to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau theorizes that their light-based powers are connected through quantum entanglement, switching places when any of the three simultaneously use their powers. Danvers, Rambeau and Khan converge at a \nSkrull\n refugee colony on \nTarnax IV\n, a planet founded through Danvers' aid, where complex peace negotiations balance on the edge. When negotiations fail, Dar-Benn opens another jump point, siphoning the atmosphere from Tarnax to replenish Hala's air. Danvers, Rambeau, and Khan form a team, dubbed \"the \nMarvels\n\" by Khan, after evacuating the colony. They spend time learning to control their switching, eventually coming to master it.\n \n \n \n \n \nAladna\n is rid of its water\n \n \nDanvers explains that the Quantum Bands played a significant role in establishing the jump point network, and Dar-Benn, by merging her Quantum Band with the Kree's \nUniversal Weapon\n, is causing instability in the network. The group realize that Dar-Benn is targeting planets significant to Danvers, holding her responsible for the desolation of Hala. The Marvels reach the water planet \nAladna\n ahead of Dar-Benn, preparing the locals for an impending attack. Dar-Benn arrives and tries to divert the planet's water to Hala, nearly seizing Kamala's Quantum Band. Despite Danvers' insistence that they can stop Dar-Benn, Khan makes them leave, leading to an argument between all three. They make up and realize that Dar-Benn will next be targeting Earth's \nSun\n. The Marvels successfully subdue Dar-Benn, and in her final attempt, she uses both Quantum Bands to create a space rift. This action results in Dar-Benn's destruction, the termination of the Marvels' entanglement, and the formation of a rupture between realities.\n \n \n \n \n \nRambeau\n seals the rift\n \n \nFollowing Kamala's successful retrieval of the Bands, she and Danvers seamlessly blend their formidable powers to infuse Rambeau with an unprecedented surge of energy. This newfound strength enables Rambeau to seal the interdimensional rift from the alternate side, stranding herself in the process. As Kamala makes her return to Earth, Danvers soars towards Hala's sun. Employing her powers, Danvers manages to rejuvenate the celestial body. Kamala then began to assemble a new team of young heroes, beginning with \nKate Bishop\n. Rambeau later awakens in an \nalternate universe\n, greeted by \nBinary\n  a Variant of her mother \nMaria\n  and the \nmutant\n scientist, \nBeast\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nBrie Larson\n as \nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\nTeyonah Parris\n as Captain \nMonica Rambeau\nKenedy McCallam-Martin\n as Little \nMonica Rambeau\nAkira Akbar\n as Young \nMonica Rambeau\n \n(archive footage; uncredited)\nIman Vellani\n as \nKamala Khan/Ms. Marvel\nZawe Ashton\n as Supremor \nDar-Benn\nGary Lewis\n as Emperor \nDro'ge\nPark Seo-Joon\n as Prince \nYan\nZenobia Shroff\n as \nMuneeba Khan\nMohan Kapur\n as \nYusuf Khan\nSaagar Shaikh\n as \nAamir Khan\nSamuel L.
