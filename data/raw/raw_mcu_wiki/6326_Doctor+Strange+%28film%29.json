When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place - a mysterious enclave known as \nKamar-Taj\n. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange -- armed with newly acquired magical powers - is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.\n[\n2\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \nKathmandu\n, \nNepal\n, a group of \nrogue sorcerers\n infiltrate the \nKamar-Taj\n, an enclave that is known only to the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n. After beheading the \nlibrarian\n, the group's leader \nKaecilius\n steals a forbidden ritual from a \nbook\n owned by his former mentor, the \nAncient One\n. As the Zealots escape through a portal to \nLondon\n, the Sorcerer Supreme traps them in a \nMirror Dimension\n that is invisible to the public. She takes down several Zealots but fails to stop Kaecilius and his surviving followers from escaping with the ritual.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nElsewhere in \nNew York City\n, \nStephen Strange\n is an acclaimed doctor and neurosurgeon working at \nMetro-General Hospital\n, but is also very arrogant and cares only for the wealth and success his talents bring. One night, as he travels to give a guest talk, he is involved in a car crash after diverting his attention from the road. Although he survives, his hands are badly injured, necessitating the insertion of metal pins into them. As a result, they continuously tremble, leaving Strange barely able to write his name, ending his career. His former lover and co-worker \nChristine Palmer\n tries to help him move on, but Strange is desperate to heal his injuries and harshly orders her to leave him alone. \n \n \n \n \n \nStephen  Strange\n floats throughout the \nMultiverse\n \n \nAfter months trying experimental surgeries on his hands, using up all his money and resources, Strange seeks out \nJonathan Pangborn\n, a paraplegic who mysteriously was able to walk again. Pangborn directs Strange to the secret compound \nKamar-Taj\n, where he is taken in by another sorcerer under the Ancient One, \nKarl Mordo\n. The Ancient One shows Strange her power, revealing the \nAstral Plane\n and other dimensions such as the \nMirror Dimension\n. Strange begs her to teach him, and she eventually agrees despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange begins his tutelage under the Ancient One and Mordo, and learns from the ancient books in the library which is now protected by the master \nWong\n. It is explained that \nEarth\n is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, found in \nNew York City\n, \nLondon\n, and \nHong Kong\n. The task of the sorcerers is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn chose to forgo this responsibility in favor of channeling energy into walking again; Strange will have to decide between regaining the use of his hands and defending the world. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange advances quickly over several months, even secretly reading from the forbidden texts and learning to bend time with the mystical \nEye of Agamotto\n. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against using such power and breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogant yearning for power to that of Kaecilius, who believes that everyone should live as long as the Ancient One after the deaths of his loved ones.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nKaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to begin summoning the powerful \nDormammu\n of the \nDark Dimension\n, where time does not exist and all can live forever. To ensure Dormammu's arrival, Kaecilius and his followers begin \ntargeting\n the sanctums, firstly \ndestroying\n the \nLondon Sanctum\n, which accidentally sends Strange from Kamar-Taj to the \nNew York\n Sanctum. Kaecilius and the Zealots then \nclash\n there, where Strange holds them off with the mystical \nCloak of Levitation\n until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that her long life has come from her own use of Dormammu's power. Kaecilius mortally \nwounds\n the Ancient One, and escapes to \nHong Kong\n. The Ancient One tells Strange that he too will have to break the rules, to balance out Mordo's steadfast nature, before dying despite the best efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange \nuses the Eye to turn back time\n and save Wong, before creating an infinite \ntime loop\n inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange breaks the loop, taking Kaecilius and his Zealots with him, which grants them their immortality, but at a \nhorrific cost\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Mordo severs all ties to Kamar-Taj and departs on his own. Strange soon returns the Eye, which Wong calls an \nInfinity Stone\n, to Kamar-Taj, and then takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMonths later\n, Strange is visited at the Sanctum by \nThor\n, who has brought his brother \nLoki\n to Earth to search for their father \nOdin\n. Strange agrees to help on the condition they will return immediately to \nAsgard\n. Elsewhere, Mordo visits Pangborn and steals the energy he uses to walk, stating his intention to stop the continued misuse of power by Earth's sorcerers.\nCast\n[\n]\nBenedict Cumberbatch\n as \nStephen Strange/Doctor Strange\n / \nDormammu\n[\n3\n]\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n as Master \nKarl Mordo\nRachel McAdams\n as Doctor \nChristine Palmer\nBenedict Wong\n as Master \nWong\nMads Mikkelsen\n as Master \nKaecilius\nTilda Swinton\n as \nAncient One\nMichael Stuhlbarg\n as Doctor \nNicodemus West\nBenjamin Bratt\n as \nJonathan Pangborn\nScott Adkins\n as \nLucian Aster\nZara Phythian\n as \nBrunette Zealot\nAlaa Safi\n as \nTall Zealot\nKatrina Durden\n as \nBlonde Zealot\nTopo Wresniwiro\n as Master \nHamir\nUmit Ulgen\n as Master \nSol Rama\nLinda Louise Duan\n as Master \nTina Minoru\nMark Anthony Brighton\n as Master \nDaniel Drumm\nMeera Syal\n as Doctor \nPatel\nAmy Landecker\n as Doctor \nBruner\nAdam Pelta-Pauls\n as Nurse \nBilly\nSarah Malin\n as Doctor \nGarrison\nEben Young\n as Doctor \nWeiss\nGuillaume Faure\n as Doctor \nEtienne\nStan Lee\n as \nBus Passenger\nEzra Khan\n as \nKamar-Taj Librarian\nPat Kiernan\n as \nHimself\nDean Ridge\n as \nNervous Zealot\n \n(uncredited)\nChris Hemsworth\n as \nThor\n \n(\nmid-credits scene\n)\nLulu Wilson\n as \nDonna Strange\n \n(deleted scene)\n[\n4\n]\nTony Paul West\n as \nHugh Goodbody\n \n(uncredited)\nAnnarie Boor\n as \nMarie Boon\n \n(uncredited)\nCameron Moon\n as \nSadhu\n \n(uncredited)\nUnknown Actor as \nPriest\n \n(deleted scene)\nAppearances\n[\n]\nLocations\n[\n]\nEarth\nKathmandu\n, \nNepal\nKamar-Taj\nSwayambhunath Temple\nKrishna Mandir Temple\nLondon\n, \nEngland\nLondon Sanctum\nExeter College\nNew York City\n, \nNew York\nMetro-General Hospital\nStephen Strange's Apartment\nAvengers Tower\nChrysler Building\nGeorge Washington Bridge\nNew York Sanctum\nJonathan Pangborn's Workshop\nMount Everest\nHong Kong\n, \nChina\nHong Kong Sanctum\nSwitzerland\n \n(map)\nSlovenia\n \n(map)\nIndia\n \n(map)\nTokyo\n, \nJapan\n \n(mentioned)\nMultiverse\nAstral Dimension\nMirror Dimension\nDark Dimension\nQuantum Realm\nActiniaria Dimension\nFlowering Incense Dimension\nGrass Jelly Dimension\nMandelibus Dimension\nRealm of Madness\nQuadriverse\nAsgard\n \n(mentioned)\nEvents\n[\n]\nTheft of the Book of Cagliostro\nStephen Strange's Car Crash\nSummoning of Dormammu\nDestruction of the London Sanctum\nBattle at the New York Sanctum\nDuel on the Astral Plane\nBattle of the Mirror Dimension\nBattle at the Hong Kong Sanctum\nSkirmish in the Dark Dimension\nAttack on Jonathan Pangborn\nItems\n[\n]\nEye of Agamotto\nTime Stone\nSling Ring\nCloak of Levitation\nTao Mandalas\nEldritch Whip\nOrb of Agamotto\nQuarterstaff\nTao Fan\nStaff of the Living Tribunal\nVaulting Boots of Valtorr\nBrazier of Bom'Galiath\nScythe Daggers\nWand of Watoomb\nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\nDaggers of Daveroth\nHoary Hosts of Hoggoth\nMitigator of Minh Mang\nSpecter's Staff\nGolden Gauntlets of Gamorr\nRotunda of Gateways\nStaff of One\nZealot Weapons\nCurved Horn Sword\nRam's Head Club\nSpear of Severity\nSpace-Time Shard\nLibrary of \nKamar-Taj\nBook of Cagliostro\nBook of the Invisible Sun\nCodex Imperium\nMaxim's Primer\nAstronomia Nova\nKey of Solomon\nVedic Sanskrit\nThe Doors of Perception\nConcepts\n[\n]\nMagic\nNelvayu\nTime Travel\nVehicles\n[\n]\nJeep\nLamborghini Huracn\nSentient Species\n[\n]\nHumans\nMindless Ones\nFaltine\nAsgardians\nDemons\n \n(mentioned)\nCreatures\n[\n]\nDogs\nButterflies\nPigeons\nSheep\n \n(mentioned)\nOrganizations\n[\n]\nMasters of the Mystic Arts\nZealots\nAsgardian Royal Family\nNY1\nUnited States Air Force\n \n(mentioned)\nUnited States Marine Corps\n \n(mentioned)\nAvengers\n \n(mentioned)\nCNN\n \n(mentioned)\nAmerican Neurological Association\n \n(mentioned)\nMentioned\n[\n]\nAdria\nKaecilius\n' Son\nCagliostro\nAgamotto\nLiving Tribunal\nValtorr\nWatoomb\nCyttorak\nDaveroth\nLoki\nOdin\nAristotle\nAdele\nDrake\nBono\nEminem\nBob Seger\nKatmandu\nBeyonc\nWikipedia\nGoogle Translate\nProduction\n[\n]\nKevin Feige\n only had this to say, \"\nI think '\nDr. Strange\n' would kick ass. I think we've done very well at the superhero genre, if you will, this street level superhero aspect of the Marvel Universe. I think with \nThor\n you'll see us cracking into the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe in a very good way that's never been done before in our movies and I'd love to get into that supernatural element. I think that Dr. Strange could be a good way of being the linchpin to that universe with \nWerewolf By Night\n, with \nBlade\n again someday  that side of the Marvel Universe.\"\nIn January 2013, Kevin Feige spoke about characters he considered might be going into development in \nPhase Three\n, \"\nDoctor Strange, which I've been talking about for years, is definitely one of them. He's a great, original character, and he checks the box off this criteria that I have: he's totally different from anything else we have, just like \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n.\"\nOn June 3, 2014 \nScott Derrickson\n tweeted that his next movie will be \nDoctor Strange\n, and that casting directors were looking at \nTom Hardy\n and \nBenedict Cumberbatch\n for the lead role.\nIn September 2014, the film was announced to begin shooting in May 2015 at \nPinewood-Shepperton studios\n in the UK.\n[\n5\n]\nOn August 29, 2014, it was announced that \nJoaquin Phoenix\n entered final negotiations.\n[\n6\n]\n On October 1, 2014, it was announced that talks with Phoenix have ended and the studio is actively searching for their lead actor.\n[\n7\n]\n In December 2014, \nDeadline\n reported that Phoenix never had a deal with Marvel Studios.\n[\n8\n]\nOn October 27, 2014, it was revealed that \nBenedict Cumberbatch\n was in final negotiations to play Doctor Strange.\n[\n9\n]\n At the end of October, it was announced on the Marvel Event Liveblog it will be released on November 4, 2016.\n[\n10\n]\n On December 4, 2014, Marvel finalized its deal with Benedict Cumberbatch to portray Stephen Strange.\n[\n11\n]\nOn January 22, 2015, it was reported that Marvel was looking to cast \nChiwetel Ejiofor\n in an unspecified role.\n[\n12\n]\n On June 11, 2015, Chiwetel Ejiofor was cast as Baron Mordo.\n[\n13\n]\nOn July 14, 2015, \nTilda Swinton\n was cast as the \nAncient One\n.\n[\n14\n]\nOn August 15, 2015, at D23, Kevin Feige confirmed that \nChiwetel Ejiofor\n and \nTilda Swinton\n have joined the cast of \nDoctor Strange\n as \nKarl Mordo\n and the \nAncient One\n, respectively, while also showing off new concept art for the series that gave fans their first look at the design of star Benedict Cumberbatch's costume.\n[\n15\n]\nOn August 27, 2015, \nMads Mikkelsen\n was in early talks to play one of the villians in the film.\n[\n16\n]\n Marvel officially announced Mikkelsen's role as \nKaecilius\n when they announced that the movie had begun production.\nVideos\n[\n]\nTrailers\n[\n]\nMarvel's Doctor Strange Teaser Trailer\nDoctor Strange Official Trailer 2\nDoctor Strange TV Spot\nStrange's Time -
