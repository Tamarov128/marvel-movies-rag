However, on the day that he is to be crowned, Thor reacts with brutality when the gods' enemies, the \nFrost Giants\n, enter the \npalace\n in violation of their treaty. As punishment, Odin banishes Thor to \nEarth\n. While \nLoki\n, Thor's brother, plots mischief in Asgard, Thor, now stripped of his powers, faces his \ngreatest threat\n.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\nIn \n965 A.D.\n, \nOdin\n describes a \nbattle\n in \nJotunheim\n between the \nFrost Giants\n and \nAsgardians\n, the \nJotuns\n use the Casket of Ancient Winters to use the cold of that winter to freeze and kill innocent people, and later the Asgardians come to the rescue. The Asgardians win, take possession of the powerful \nCasket of Ancient Winters\n, and return to their realm. Sometime later, Odin is talking to his two sons, energetic \nThor\n and a more thoughtful \nLoki\n. Odin says both of them are worthy but only one can be king of Asgard.\n \n \n \n \n \nOdin\n throne\n \n \nIn \nthe present day\n. Thor, now an adult, prepares for a ceremony where he would be formally recognized as crown prince. Loki looks on enviously. Before Odin can follow through with the proclamation, he senses the presence of intruders. Three Frost Giants infiltrate the \nsecure rooms\n that hold the Casket. However, the \nDestroyer\n appears and stops the intruders from reattaining the casket, killing all three. Examining the remains, Odin seems calm, yet Thor is angry and wants to attack. Odin disagrees.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n and \nLoki\n negotiate with King \nLaufey\n \n \nThor gathers Loki and his close friends, \nVolstagg\n, \nFandral\n, \nHogun\n, and \nSif\n, and they ride out to the \nBifrost Bridge\n. \nHeimdall\n allows them to pass and the six are transported to the Frost Giants' domain, \nJotunheim\n, a frozen, crumbling wasteland. They confront \nLaufey\n who taunts the Asgardian warriors. More Frost Giants surround the six as Laufey allows them the chance to leave peacefully. Loki manages to persuade his brother into accepting the offer and they prepare to depart. However, Thor reacts brashly to a Frost Giant's insult and a battle starts. During the battle, Loki experiences an unusual reaction when he is touched by a Frost Giant.\n \n \n \n \n \nOdin\n tries and fails to make peace with \nLaufey\n \n \nLaufey releases a \nFrost Beast\n and the Asgardians retreat to the Bifrost. Thor kills the beast but once again the team is surrounded and things look desperate. Odin arrives and intervenes to save the warriors, apologizing to Laufey for the intrusion and attempting to reinstate peace, but Laufey states that they are beyond reason, that the Frost Giants are now at war with Asgard. He attempts to stab Odin, who blasts Laufey back and takes the young Asgardians home.\n \n \n \n \n \nOdin\n banishes \nThor\n for his arrogant behavior\n \n \nBack at the Asgard side of the portal, Odin lets the four friends go and confronts Thor and Loki. Odin is furious that Thor has dragged Asgard back into war, and tells Thor he is not fit to be king. Loki tries to calm his father but is quickly silenced. Odin strips Thor of his powers, banishes him to \nEarth\n, and sends his hammer, \nMjlnir\n, after him a few seconds later, saying, \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\"\nOn Earth, two physicists, \nJane Foster\n and \nErik Selvig\n, and \nDarcy Lewis\n, an intern, are in the \nNew Mexico\n desert, working from the van while conducting research on an aurora-borealis-type phenomenon. Suddenly a large tornado/lightning storm develops and they drive towards it to investigate. The van hits Thor from inside the maelstrom and they stop. Thor faintly begins to question where he is and becomes aggressive to the point that Lewis tases him, knocking him out. The three scientists load him into their van and take him to the hospital. Once again he starts fighting as he wakes up and he is eventually tranquilized. Selvig tries to get Foster to leave him be, saying he is some kind of nut, but she is curious and attracted to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nJane Foster\n learns about \nMjlnir\n \n \nWhen the scientists return to their outpost in town they discover \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n confiscating all of their equipment and research in connection to the recent atmospheric disturbances, and the appearance of Thor's hammer. Unsure of what to do, the trio goes back to the hospital but Thor has escaped. As they drive off in the van, they hit the Asgardian man again and knock him out, but this time they take him with them. Foster gives him civilian clothes that belonged to her \nex-boyfriend\n. After overhearing locals discussing a satellite crash 50 miles due west, Thor decides to go there, and once again Selvig tries to get Foster to leave him alone. Thor walks about the town and tries to get a horse in a \npet store\n. Foster appears and gives him a ride and the two head west in the van.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n fails to pull \nMjlnir\n from the crater\n \n \nAt the satellite crash site, a crowd of local townspeople has gathered; people are partying and trying to lift the hammer from the crater. Later, S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and takes over the site, setting up a temporary camp to study the hammer. After dark, Foster and Thor arrive on the scene. Thor infiltrates the encampment while Foster huddles in safety. After beating up many agents, and being targeted by \nClint Barton\n, Thor finally reaches the hammer but is unable to lift it. He howls at his powerlessness and drops to the ground, putting up no fight as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents close in and take him.\n \n \n \n \n \nLoki\n and \nFrigga\n with \nOdin\n in his \nOdinsleep\n \n \nOn Asgard, Thor's four friends begin to suspect Loki had something to do with Thor's banishment. Loki realizes that he is not a pure Asgardian and Odin admits that Loki was taken from Jotunheim as an infant and raised as his own. Loki is confused and angry as Odin falls into a coma-like state called the \"\nOdinsleep\n\", leaving Loki to become acting king.\n \n \n \n \n \nPhil Coulson\n interrogates \nThor\n \n \nBack on Earth, \nPhil Coulson\n questions Thor, and when he leaves him alone briefly, Loki appears in the room. Loki tells Thor that Odin is dead and he cannot come back to Asgard, leaving Thor distraught. Selvig, with a faked driver license, arrives and lies to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, telling them that Thor is Foster's ex-husband and is under the influence of steroids. Coulson lets Selvig take Thor, who surreptitiously grabs Foster's notebook on the way out. Back in town, Selvig takes Thor out for a drink, now trying to convince Thor to leave Foster alone due to the complications he has and would continue to cause her. The two chug boilermakers and bond. Thor brings the drunk Selvig to Foster's trailer. Thor and Foster go outside to gaze at the stars, and Thor explains the \nNine Realms\n and the Bifrost Bridge to her. She figures the bridge is the theoretical Einstein-Rosen Bridge wormhole, the very same that she has been researching.\n \n \n \n \n \nLoki\n uses the \nCasket of Ancient Winters\n against \nHeimdall\n \n \nLoki freezes Heimdall and uses the Bifrost to meet with Laufey. It is revealed that Loki was the one who let the Frost Giants into Asgard to try to retrieve the casket during Thor's coronation. He makes a deal with Laufey that he will let them into Asgard again to kill Odin and have their casket, and in return, they will return home in peace. Loki then commands the Destroyer to go to Earth and kill Thor.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n and \nJane Foster\n say goodbye\n \n \nThe Destroyer arrives in the New Mexico desert and starts blasting everything with a heat ray. Thor and the three scientists attempt to get everyone away safely. Thor confronts the Destroyer and asks Loki, who can see and hear what is going on from Asgard, to leave the humans alone in return for himself. The Destroyer gives Thor a vicious backhand slap and sends him tumbling, apparently dead. Jane runs to the body in tears. However, Thor's selfless act of protection proves him worthy to once again wield Mjlnir, which frees itself from the crater and returns to Thor's hand. He is restored to full life and vigor and once again fitted in his red cape and armor. He easily defeats the Destroyer and tries to return to Asgard, promising Foster he will return.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n returns to \nAsgard\n \n \nThe Frost Giants invade Asgard through the portal, walking past the frozen Heimdall. Laufey goes to Odin's bedchamber and, as he prepares to kill the Norse god, Loki kills Laufey to appear to be the hero. Although frozen, Heimdall is conscious and manages to break free and brings Thor back to Asgard. Thor flies quickly to fight the Frost Giants.\n \n \n \n \n \nLoki\n falls to his apparent death\n \n \nLoki goes to the Himinbjorg and sets the bridge up to destroy the ice planet Jotunheim. Thor tries to stop him and the two engage in combat. Thor immobilizes Loki with Mjlnir and starts to destroy the \nRainbow Bridge\n to stop the portal. When the bridge shatters, the two brothers fall into space but Odin arrives and catches Thor, who holds Loki's staff. Loki admits defeat and allows himself to fall, disappearing into the void.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n asks about \nJane Foster\n \n \nAll seems back to normal on Asgard, although Odin is saddened by the turn of events. Thor mourns for his brother and misses Jane Foster, whom he is unable to visit with the Bifrost now destroyed. However, Heimdall, gazing out over the severed edge of the Rainbow Bridge, assures him that Foster is looking for him. Back on Earth, Foster is in a new lab with new equipment, now being assisted by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n \n \n \n \n \nErik Selvig\n meets \nNick Fury\n \n \nAfterwards\n, Selvig has been taken to the \nJoint Dark Energy Mission Facility\n where he meets \nNick Fury\n. Fury shows him the \nTesseract\n in a briefcase, which he says could be a source of unlimited power. Loki appears in a reflection, invisible to Selvig and Fury, and says \"Well, I guess that's worth a look,\" which Selvig repeats due to Loki's subtle influence.\nCast\n[\n]\nChris Hemsworth\n as \nThor\nDakota Goyo\n as Young \nThor\nNatalie Portman\n as Doctor \nJane Foster\nTom Hiddleston\n as \nLoki\nTed Allpress\n as Young \nLoki\nAnthony Hopkins\n as King \nOdin\nStellan Skarsgrd\n as Doctor \nErik Selvig\nKat Dennings\n as \nDarcy Lewis\nClark Gregg\n as Agent \nPhil Coulson\nColm Feore\n as King \nLaufey\nIdris Elba\n as \nHeimdall\nRay Stevenson\n as \nVolstagg\nTadanobu Asano\n as \nHogun\nJoshua Dallas\n as \nFandral\nJaimie Alexander\n as \nSif\nRene Russo\n as Queen \nFrigga\nAdriana Barraza\n as \nIsabela Alvarez\nMaximiliano Hernndez\n as Agent \nJasper Sitwell\nJoshua Cox\n as \nHailstrum\nJoseph Gatt\n as \nGrundroth\nLuke Massy\n as \nRaze\nBuddy Sosthand\n as Agent \nDelancey\nJamie McShane\n as Agent \nJackson\nDale Godboldo\n as Agent \nGarrett\nPatrick O'Brien Demsey\n as Agent \nCale\nMatt Battaglia\n as \nPete\nJoel McCrary\n as \nJake\nIsaac Kappy\n as \nKyle\nJ.
