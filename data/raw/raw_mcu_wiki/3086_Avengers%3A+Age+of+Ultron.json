When \nTony Stark\n tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earths Mightiest Heroes, including \nIron Man\n, \nCaptain America\n, \nThor\n, \nHulk\n, \nBlack Widow\n, and \nHawkeye\n, along with support from \nNick Fury\n and \nMaria Hill\n are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous \nUltron\n emerges, it is up to the \nAvengers\n to stop him from enacting his \nterrible plans\n, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for an epic and unique global adventure.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nAvengers\n flying to \nWolfgang von Strucker\n's \nHYDRA Research Base\n \n \nIn \n2015\n, the Avengers reassemble to track down and eliminate \nHYDRA\n's remaining members themselves, using \nTony Stark\n's resources to help. Their latest mission brings them to the location of the alien \nScepter\n that \nLoki\n utilized during the \nChitauri Invasion\n; the Scepter is now in the possession of \nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker\n, one of the notorious heads of HYDRA who has been using energy drawn from the alien weapon to power advanced weaponry, as well as attempting to empower living humans.\n \n \n \n \n \nQuicksilver\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n at the Sokovia \nHYDRA Research Base\n \n \nA \nraid\n on Strucker's base in the Eastern European country of \nSokovia\n commences, with the Avengers battling HYDRA forces to reclaim the scepter. During the battle, without Strucker's approval, two of his agents join the fray: \nPietro\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n, Sokovian twins who are the only humans to have survived exposure to the scepter's energy, and have gained supernatural powers as a result. Pietro can move at superhuman speeds, while Wanda possesses a powerful plethora of psionic powers. The twins are able to hold their own against the Avengers but are unable to prevent the heroes from capturing Strucker.\n \n \n \n \n \nWanda Maximoff\n brainwashes \nTony Stark\n \n \nStark finds the scepter, and Wanda attempts to stop him by using her powers to implant a vision into his mind. In his vision, Stark sees his teammates dead or dying while the \nChitauri\n launch an even larger invasion on \nEarth\n. Upon seeing Stark's nightmare, Wanda suspiciously allows him and the Avengers to take the scepter away before fleeing with her brother.\n \n \n \n \n \nBruce Banner\n and \nTony Stark\n discuss the Ultron Program\n \n \nWith Strucker's arrest, HYDRA has suffered a great blow and the organization is left in a state of discord. Returning to \nAvengers Tower\n with the \nScepter\n, Stark and \nBruce Banner\n begin studying the weapon. Their research leads to the discovery of a net of neurons that, according to Stark, could be reconfigured into an artificial intelligence stored inside the scepter's gem. The two scientists extract it for use in Stark's secret peacekeeping program  \"\nUltron\n\"  designed to allow the \nIron Legion\n to operate independently and safeguard Earth under the direction of an advanced AI.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nAvengers\n in \nAvengers Tower\n have a party\n \n \nAfter three days, the project is seemingly met with little success. However, while the Avengers throw a party to celebrate their recent victories, Ultron suddenly activates. Somehow already self-aware despite Stark's work has not made it that far ahead, Ultron immediately determines that the only way to save Earth is to eradicate humanity, which he deems as the prime factor in the planet's turmoils. \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n attempts to stop Ultron, but the more powerful AI appears to destroy him and then takes control of the Iron Legion armors. After the Avengers have finished their party, the team, joined by \nMaria Hill\n, \nJames Rhodes\n and geneticist \nHelen Cho\n hold a small contest to see who can lift \nMjlnir\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nUltron\n turns the \nIron Legion\n against the \nAvengers\n \n \nTheir contest is interrupted when Ultron suddenly directs the Iron Legion to attack them, and an intense battle ensues. During that battle, Ultron has a chance to kill Cho but mysteriously spares her life. While most of the Iron Legion is destroyed by the Avengers, one drone manages to escape with the scepter and flees to the Sokovian HYDRA base, where Ultron uses the HYDRA technology stored there to begin construction of an army of robotic drones as well as his own mobile unit.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n, \nThor\n and \nBlack Widow\n are incapacitated by \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nAfter the battle, the team confronts Stark about his secrecy, while Ultron recruits the Maximoff twins, who have a vendetta against Stark because a \nStark Industries\n bomb killed their parents; Wanda had willingly allowed Stark to make off with the scepter with hopes that his fear of letting the world die would lead to him constructing his own undoing, which in this case appears to be Ultron. After Ultron kills Strucker to lure the Avengers out, he and the twins travel to \nSouth Africa\n to acquire \nvibranium\n from arms dealer \nUlysses Klaue\n. The Avengers try to stop them, but Wanda hypnotizes Thor, Black Widow, and Captain America, giving them vivid hallucinations that render them invalid.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man\n vs. \nHulk\n \n \nShe then hypnotizes Banner, turning him into Hulk and sending him to attack \nJohannesburg\n. Iron Man decides to call in \"\nVeronica\n\", which deploys the \nIron Man Armor: Mark XLIV\n armor Stark needs to defeat Hulk, but the destruction they cause starts a public backlash against the Avengers, who are forced to go into hiding.\n \n \n \n \n \nLaura Barton and Clint Barton at their homestead\n \n \nThe team takes refuge at \nClint Barton's Homestead\n, where they meet his wife \nLaura\n and children \nCooper\n and \nLila\n. Having experienced apocalyptic visions in his hallucination, Thor leaves, traveling to the mystical \"\nWater of Sight\n\" to determine the meaning of his hallucination. Romanoff and Banner plan to run away and start a new life together when Ultron is defeated. \nNick Fury\n arrives at the homestead and encourages the Avengers to form a plan to stop Ultron. Banner deduces that Ultron is planning to create another body made of synthetic tissue, using the \nRegeneration Cradle\n device developed by Dr. \nHelen Cho\n. \n \n \n \n \n \nUltron\n uses the \nScepter\n control \nHelen Cho\n \n \nMeanwhile, Ultron, Pietro and Wanda go to Dr. Cho's laboratory in \nSeoul\n, \nSouth Korea\n, where Ultron reveals his plan to use the vibranium samples in conjunction with Cho's synthetic tissue from the \nRegeneration Cradle\n to create a more powerful body for himself, with the scepter's gem as its primary power source. To ensure her cooperation, Ultron takes control of Cho's mind with the scepter.\n \n \n \n \n \nUltron\n almost throws \nCaptain America\n off the truck\n \n \nAs Ultron transfers his consciousness into the synthetic body and Cho implants the gem into its forehead, Wanda curiously looks into Ultron's mind and discovers his plan to destroy humanity. Realizing that Ultron used them, the twins turn against Ultron, who leaves the laboratory with the Regeneration Cradle. Arriving in Seoul, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye battle Ultron, who kidnaps Black Widow and derails a train to slow the Avengers down. The twins aid Captain America in rescuing passengers from the train, while Hawkeye retrieves the Regeneration Cradle and takes it back to Avengers Tower.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n talking about \nUltron\n \n \nAt Stark Tower, Stark and Banner upload J.A.R.V.I.S.  which survived Ultron's earlier attack by escaping into the internet  into the synthetic body as an attempt to rectify their mistake with Ultron. Believing Stark is about to potentially create another Ultron, Captain America and the twins try to stop them, but Thor arrives and brings the body to life with lightning.\n \n \n \n \n \nVision\n saying how to destroy \nUltron\n \n \nThe resulting being thankfully proves friendly. Thor explains that the scepter's gem is the Mind Stone  one of the six \nInfinity Stones\n, the most powerful objects in existence  which Thor saw in his hallucination, and its power could be advantageous against Ultron. The twins and the synthetic being, who is later given the name \nVision\n, ally themselves with the Avengers, who return to Sokovia to end Ultron's threat once and for all. \n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n talking to \nSteve Rogers\n during the \nBattle of Sokovia\n \n \nArriving in Sokovia, the Avengers find that Ultron has used the remaining vibranium samples and Chitauri anti-gravity technologies being studied in the HYDRA facility to build a machine that lifts a large part of \nNovi Grad\n, the Sokovian capital, into the sky. His intent is to crash it into the ground to replicate a meteor strike, causing a mass extinction event. While Banner rescues Romanoff, the Avengers evacuate civilians from the city and fight Ultron's army of robots, but they are unable to evacuate everyone before the city begins to ascend. Fury and the revived \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, joined by \nWar Machine\n, arrive in a \nHelicarrier\n to assist in evacuating the last few civilians.\n \n \n \n \n \nQuicksilver\n is shot by \nUltron\n \n \nBlack Widow and Banner, now transformed into Hulk, enter the fray and the team converges on the location of Ultron's device. There, they wipe out most of Ultron's drones and severely damage Ultron's primary body. In retaliation, Ultron hijacks the Avengers' \nQuinjet\n and kills Pietro. Hulk leaps into the jet and tosses Ultron out of the rear hatch. Ultron crash lands in an abandoned tram, where a grieving Wanda finds and destroys him by ripping his heart out.\n \n \n \n \n \nUltron\n vs. \nVision\n \n \nOne of Ultron's drones deactivates the device, causing Novi Grad to begin plummeting towards the Earth, and forcing the other Avengers to flee aboard the Helicarrier alongside the evacuated citizens. As Vision flies back into the falling city and rescues Wanda, Iron Man fires his Unibeam and Thor summons a lightning strike to reflect off the Vibranium core. The ensuing explosion shatters the city into rubble, which falls safely into a nearby lake. Hulk, seeking peace after the battle, gets Romanoff to safety and departs in the Quinjet. Ultron's consciousness attempts to flee in the last remaining drone, but Vision confronts him. The two have a brief exchange of ideals before Vision obliterates the drone, effectively ending Ultron's threat.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nAvengers\n with \nWanda\n, \nFalcon\n, \nWar Machine\n and \nVision\n at the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \nThe Avengers establish a \nnew Avengers facility\n in upstate \nNew York\n, run by Fury, Cho, \nMaria Hill\n and \nErik Selvig\n. Romanoff assumes Banner is dead because the Quinjet cannot be tracked, and silently mourns for him, but Fury assures her that he is likely still alive. Believing the Mind Stone is safe with Vision, Thor returns to \nAsgard\n to learn more about the Infinity Stones, while Barton and Stark also leave the team. Captain America and Black Widow assemble a new Avengers team, consisting of Maximoff, \nFalcon\n, War Machine and \nVision\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThanos\n with his \nInfinity Gauntlet\n \n \nMeanwhile\n, \nThanos\n retrieves an \nInfinity Gauntlet\n and decides to begin his \ncrusade\n for the \nInfinity Stones\n himself.\nCast\n[\n]\nRobert Downey Jr.\n as \nTony Stark/Iron Man\nChris Hemsworth\n as \nThor\nMark Ruffalo\n as \nBruce Banner/Hulk\nChris Evans\n as \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\nScarlett Johansson\n as \nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\nJeremy Renner\n as \nClint Barton/Hawkeye\nDon Cheadle\n as \nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nAaron Taylor-Johnson\n as \nPietro Maximoff/Quicksilver\nElizabeth Olsen\n as \nWanda Maximoff\nPaul Bettany\n as \nVision\n / \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\nCobie Smulders\n as \nMaria Hill\nAnthony Mackie\n as \nSam Wilson/Falcon\nHayley Atwell\n as \nPeggy Carter\n \n(vision)\nIdris Elba\n as \nHeimdall\n \n(vision)\nLinda Cardellini\n as \nLaura Barton\nStellan Skarsgrd\n as Doctor \nErik Selvig\nClaudia Kim\n as Doctor \nHelen Cho\nThomas Kretschmann\n as \nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker\nJames Spader\n as \nUltron\n / \nUltron Sentries\nNeil Fingleton\n as \nUltron\n \n(motion capture)\nSamuel L.

Feige explained, \n\"We came up with a few titles, but every month a new comic book appeared, and that's a great title. Age of Ultron is a great title. We had a few other 'Of Ultrons', but that was the best one. So we're borrowing that title, but taking storylines from decades of Avengers storylines.\n Also Whedon added: \n\"We're doing our own version of the origin story of Ultron....We were crafting our own version of it where [Ultron's] own origin comes more directly from the Avengers we already know about. The other thing is in the origin story there was \nHank Pym\n, so a lot of people assumed he was going to be in the mix, but he's not. We're basically taking the things from the comics for the movies that we need and can use. A lot of stuff has to fall by the wayside.\"\nIn December 2012, Whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film.\nOn January 24, 2014, the Forte di Bard Association announced that filming would take place at \nFort Bard\n in the \nAosta Valley\n region of Italy in March 2014, as well as other locations in Aosta Valley including \nAosta\n, \nDonnas\n, \nBard\n, \nPont-Saint-Martin\n, and \nVerrs\n. The next month, the Gauteng Film Commission announced that action sequences would be filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa and other locations in \nGauteng\n, beginning in mid-February. A few weeks later Marvel announced that portions of the film would be shot in South Korea. Filming was scheduled to take place in the \nGyeonggi Province\n and its capital Seoul with South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism reimbursing up to 30% of the studio's expenditures, as part of a state-funded incentive program.\nFilming finally began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed for a day.
