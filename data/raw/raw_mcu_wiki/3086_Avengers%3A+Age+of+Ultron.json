When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earths Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to the Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for an epic and unique global adventure.[1] Plot[] The Avengers flying to Wolfgang von Strucker's HYDRA Research Base In 2015, the Avengers reassemble to track down and eliminate HYDRA's remaining members themselves, using Tony Stark's resources to help. Their latest mission brings them to the location of the alien Scepter that Loki utilized during the Chitauri Invasion; the Scepter is now in the possession of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, one of the notorious heads of HYDRA who has been using energy drawn from the alien weapon to power advanced weaponry, as well as attempting to empower living humans. Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff at the Sokovia HYDRA Research Base A raid on Strucker's base in the Eastern European country of Sokovia commences, with the Avengers battling HYDRA forces to reclaim the scepter. During the battle, without Strucker's approval, two of his agents join the fray: Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, Sokovian twins who are the only humans to have survived exposure to the scepter's energy, and have gained supernatural powers as a result. Pietro can move at superhuman speeds, while Wanda possesses a powerful plethora of psionic powers. The twins are able to hold their own against the Avengers but are unable to prevent the heroes from capturing Strucker. Wanda Maximoff brainwashes Tony Stark Stark finds the scepter, and Wanda attempts to stop him by using her powers to implant a vision into his mind. In his vision, Stark sees his teammates dead or dying while the Chitauri launch an even larger invasion on Earth. Upon seeing Stark's nightmare, Wanda suspiciously allows him and the Avengers to take the scepter away before fleeing with her brother. Bruce Banner and Tony Stark discuss the Ultron Program With Strucker's arrest, HYDRA has suffered a great blow and the organization is left in a state of discord. Returning to Avengers Tower with the Scepter, Stark and Bruce Banner begin studying the weapon. Their research leads to the discovery of a net of neurons that, according to Stark, could be reconfigured into an artificial intelligence stored inside the scepter's gem. The two scientists extract it for use in Stark's secret peacekeeping program \"Ultron\" designed to allow the Iron Legion to operate independently and safeguard Earth under the direction of an advanced AI. The Avengers in Avengers Tower have a party After three days, the project is seemingly met with little success. However, while the Avengers throw a party to celebrate their recent victories, Ultron suddenly activates. Somehow already self-aware despite Stark's work has not made it that far ahead, Ultron immediately determines that the only way to save Earth is to eradicate humanity, which he deems as the prime factor in the planet's turmoils. J.A.R.V.I.S. attempts to stop Ultron, but the more powerful AI appears to destroy him and then takes control of the Iron Legion armors. After the Avengers have finished their party, the team, joined by Maria Hill, James Rhodes and geneticist Helen Cho hold a small contest to see who can lift Mjlnir. Ultron turns the Iron Legion against the Avengers Their contest is interrupted when Ultron suddenly directs the Iron Legion to attack them, and an intense battle ensues. During that battle, Ultron has a chance to kill Cho but mysteriously spares her life. While most of the Iron Legion is destroyed by the Avengers, one drone manages to escape with the scepter and flees to the Sokovian HYDRA base, where Ultron uses the HYDRA technology stored there to begin construction of an army of robotic drones as well as his own mobile unit. Captain America, Thor and Black Widow are incapacitated by Wanda Maximoff After the battle, the team confronts Stark about his secrecy, while Ultron recruits the Maximoff twins, who have a vendetta against Stark because a Stark Industries bomb killed their parents; Wanda had willingly allowed Stark to make off with the scepter with hopes that his fear of letting the world die would lead to him constructing his own undoing, which in this case appears to be Ultron. After Ultron kills Strucker to lure the Avengers out, he and the twins travel to South Africa to acquire vibranium from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. The Avengers try to stop them, but Wanda hypnotizes Thor, Black Widow, and Captain America, giving them vivid hallucinations that render them invalid. Iron Man vs. Hulk She then hypnotizes Banner, turning him into Hulk and sending him to attack Johannesburg. Iron Man decides to call in \"Veronica\", which deploys the Iron Man Armor: Mark XLIV armor Stark needs to defeat Hulk, but the destruction they cause starts a public backlash against the Avengers, who are forced to go into hiding. Laura Barton and Clint Barton at their homestead The team takes refuge at Clint Barton's Homestead, where they meet his wife Laura and children Cooper and Lila. Having experienced apocalyptic visions in his hallucination, Thor leaves, traveling to the mystical \"Water of Sight\" to determine the meaning of his hallucination. Romanoff and Banner plan to run away and start a new life together when Ultron is defeated. Nick Fury arrives at the homestead and encourages the Avengers to form a plan to stop Ultron. Banner deduces that Ultron is planning to create another body made of synthetic tissue, using the Regeneration Cradle device developed by Dr. Helen Cho. Ultron uses the Scepter control Helen Cho Meanwhile, Ultron, Pietro and Wanda go to Dr. Cho's laboratory in Seoul, South Korea, where Ultron reveals his plan to use the vibranium samples in conjunction with Cho's synthetic tissue from the Regeneration Cradle to create a more powerful body for himself, with the scepter's gem as its primary power source. To ensure her cooperation, Ultron takes control of Cho's mind with the scepter. Ultron almost throws Captain America off the truck As Ultron transfers his consciousness into the synthetic body and Cho implants the gem into its forehead, Wanda curiously looks into Ultron's mind and discovers his plan to destroy humanity. Realizing that Ultron used them, the twins turn against Ultron, who leaves the laboratory with the Regeneration Cradle. Arriving in Seoul, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye battle Ultron, who kidnaps Black Widow and derails a train to slow the Avengers down. The twins aid Captain America in rescuing passengers from the train, while Hawkeye retrieves the Regeneration Cradle and takes it back to Avengers Tower. Captain America and Wanda Maximoff talking about Ultron At Stark Tower, Stark and Banner upload J.A.R.V.I.S. which survived Ultron's earlier attack by escaping into the internet into the synthetic body as an attempt to rectify their mistake with Ultron. Believing Stark is about to potentially create another Ultron, Captain America and the twins try to stop them, but Thor arrives and brings the body to life with lightning. Vision saying how to destroy Ultron The resulting being thankfully proves friendly. Thor explains that the scepter's gem is the Mind Stone one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence which Thor saw in his hallucination, and its power could be advantageous against Ultron. The twins and the synthetic being, who is later given the name Vision, ally themselves with the Avengers, who return to Sokovia to end Ultron's threat once and for all. Thor talking to Steve Rogers during the Battle of Sokovia Arriving in Sokovia, the Avengers find that Ultron has used the remaining vibranium samples and Chitauri anti-gravity technologies being studied in the HYDRA facility to build a machine that lifts a large part of Novi Grad, the Sokovian capital, into the sky. His intent is to crash it into the ground to replicate a meteor strike, causing a mass extinction event. While Banner rescues Romanoff, the Avengers evacuate civilians from the city and fight Ultron's army of robots, but they are unable to evacuate everyone before the city begins to ascend. Fury and the revived S.H.I.E.L.D., joined by War Machine, arrive in a Helicarrier to assist in evacuating the last few civilians. Quicksilver is shot by Ultron Black Widow and Banner, now transformed into Hulk, enter the fray and the team converges on the location of Ultron's device. There, they wipe out most of Ultron's drones and severely damage Ultron's primary body. In retaliation, Ultron hijacks the Avengers' Quinjet and kills Pietro. Hulk leaps into the jet and tosses Ultron out of the rear hatch. Ultron crash lands in an abandoned tram, where a grieving Wanda finds and destroys him by ripping his heart out. Ultron vs. Vision One of Ultron's drones deactivates the device, causing Novi Grad to begin plummeting towards the Earth, and forcing the other Avengers to flee aboard the Helicarrier alongside the evacuated citizens. As Vision flies back into the falling city and rescues Wanda, Iron Man fires his Unibeam and Thor summons a lightning strike to reflect off the Vibranium core. The ensuing explosion shatters the city into rubble, which falls safely into a nearby lake. Hulk, seeking peace after the battle, gets Romanoff to safety and departs in the Quinjet. Ultron's consciousness attempts to flee in the last remaining drone, but Vision confronts him. The two have a brief exchange of ideals before Vision obliterates the drone, effectively ending Ultron's threat. The Avengers with Wanda, Falcon, War Machine and Vision at the Avengers Compound The Avengers establish a new Avengers facility in upstate New York, run by Fury, Cho, Maria Hill and Erik Selvig. Romanoff assumes Banner is dead because the Quinjet cannot be tracked, and silently mourns for him, but Fury assures her that he is likely still alive. Believing the Mind Stone is safe with Vision, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the Infinity Stones, while Barton and Stark also leave the team. Captain America and Black Widow assemble a new Avengers team, consisting of Maximoff, Falcon, War Machine and Vision. Thanos with his Infinity Gauntlet Meanwhile, Thanos retrieves an Infinity Gauntlet and decides to begin his crusade for the Infinity Stones himself.

W. Bush (archived footage) Production[] Despite the subtitle, the film is not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained, \"We came up with a few titles, but every month a new comic book appeared, and that's a great title. Age of Ultron is a great title. We had a few other 'Of Ultrons', but that was the best one. So we're borrowing that title, but taking storylines from decades of Avengers storylines. Also Whedon added: \"We're doing our own version of the origin story of Ultron....We were crafting our own version of it where [Ultron's] own origin comes more directly from the Avengers we already know about. The other thing is in the origin story there was Hank Pym, so a lot of people assumed he was going to be in the mix, but he's not. We're basically taking the things from the comics for the movies that we need and can use. A lot of stuff has to fall by the wayside.\" In December 2012, Whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film. On January 24, 2014, the Forte di Bard Association announced that filming would take place at Fort Bard in the Aosta Valley region of Italy in March 2014, as well as other locations in Aosta Valley including Aosta, Donnas, Bard, Pont-Saint-Martin, and Verrs. The next month, the Gauteng Film Commission announced that action sequences would be filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa and other locations in Gauteng, beginning in mid-February. A few weeks later Marvel announced that portions of the film would be shot in South Korea. Filming was scheduled to take place in the Gyeonggi Province and its capital Seoul with South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism reimbursing up to 30% of the studio's expenditures, as part of a state-funded incentive program. Filming finally began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed for a day. Second unit crews shot the action sequences, without the main cast, in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks. In March 2014, Brian Tyler signed on to compose the film's score, marking his third film collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013. Samuel L. Jackson stated that Nick Fury will have a smaller role than he had in the first film. Mark Ruffalo stated that Hulk would have more screen time in this film. After the first official poster was released in February 24, 2015, Hayley Atwell, Anthony Mackie and Idris Elba were officially confirmed to appear in the film as Peggy Carter, Sam Wilson/Falcon and Heimdall respectively. A shipyard scene was filmed in Chittagong, Bangladesh.[3] Music[] Avengers: Age of Ultron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Song title Artist Location(s) Sky Dream Hi-Finesse Teaser Trailer.
