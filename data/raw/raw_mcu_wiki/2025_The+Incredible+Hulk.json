Living in the shadows--cut off from a life he knew and the woman he loves, \nBetty Ross\n--Banner struggles to avoid the obsessive pursuit of his nemesis, General \nThunderbolt Ross\n and the military machinery that seeks to capture him and brutally exploit his power. As all three grapple with the secrets that led to Hulk's creation, they are confronted with a monstrous new adversary known as the \nAbomination\n, whose destructive strength exceeds even Hulk's own. One scientist must make an agonizing final choice: accept a peaceful life as Bruce Banner or find heroism in the creature he holds inside--The Incredible Hulk.\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \nBruce Banner\n testing \ngamma radiation\n on himself\n \n \nBruce Banner\n recalls the events from \nfive years prior\n, in which he was transformed into a monster and hospitalized his lover \nBetty Ross\n. Ross' father, General \nThaddeus Ross\n, forced Banner to go on the run for years, as he is now a fugitive of the United States Army. Banner finds a home in \nRocinha\n, \nBrazil\n, where he works at a soft drink bottling factory and has learned breathing techniques and martial arts to ward off his transformations. He is trying to find a cure with the help of \"Mr. Blue\", whom he met online. Banner has not had an \"incident\" for 5 months.\n \n \n \n \nEmil Blonsky\n and \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \nWhen Banner has a cut, his blood drips into a \nbottle\n at the factory and is ingested by an ill-fated consumer in \nMilwaukee\n, \nWisconsin\n. Ross uses this incident to pick up on Banner's trail and sends British special-ops expert \nEmil Blonsky\n with an attack team to capture Banner. Banner then makes an escape to the bottling factory he works in. During the run, he bumps into a gang of thugs, one who was his former enemy, \nSilva\n at the bottling factory. During the confrontation, Banner transforms into Hulk at the bottling factory and takes out the thugs and everyone on the team.\n \n \n \n \n \nBruce Banner\n is confronted by \nSilva\n \n \nBefore Hulk escapes, Blonsky, the last soldier alive, takes a good look at Hulk, before Hulk throws a forklift truck at him, which he barely survives. Banner escapes and goes to \nGuatemala\n, and then the US, where he finds the now recovered Betty Ross at \nCulver University\n, dating psychiatrist \nLeonard Samson\n. Banner's friend \nStanley Lieber\n (a pizzeria owner) gives him a job as a delivery boy. He uses this job to continue his research by sneaking past a security guard at the university. Ross sees Banner at the pizzeria, and they later reunite.\n \n \n \n \n \nEmil Blonsky\n arrogantly confronts \nHulk\n \n \nRoss is informed by Blonsky that Banner escaped because of a green monster. Ross continues to explain that Banner was the monster, created by a failed experiment meant to replicate the \n\"Super-Soldier\" program\n. Blonsky volunteers to be given a small dose of an altered Super Soldier serum (another failed experiment but considered \"very promising\") that increases his strength and agility. Blonsky leads a \nsecond attack\n on Banner at Culver University, where he and his team encounter Hulk and are defeated. Hulk saves Ross from an explosion and he takes her to the \nSmoky Mountain National Forest\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nBruce Banner\n nearly unleashes the Hulk\n \n \nBanner and Ross go to \nGrayburn College\n in \nNew York City\n to meet Mr. Blue, who is revealed to be \nSamuel Sterns\n. Sterns invented a potential antidote, and Banner accepts it, despite the risks. Banner is restrained and a transformation is induced, but was successfully reversed through Sterns' antidote. Sterns revealed that he synthesized Banner's blood into a large supply, in hopes of using it in the next stage of human evolution. While Banner tries to convince him otherwise, he is suddenly tranquilized by one of Ross' snipers.\n \n \n \n \n \nBetty Ross\n and \nBruce Banner\n \n \nRoss and Banner are taken into custody, while Blonsky confronts Sterns and asks him to give him a sample of Banner's blood to add to his power. Sterns warns that the Super Soldier serum and \ngamma radiation\n together could create an \"\nabomination\n\", but Blonsky doesn't change his mind. The procedure transforms Blonsky into a Hulk-like monster who knocks Sterns into a sample of Banner's blood, and goes on a rampage through \nHarlem\n looking for something that could challenge his new strength as well as to lure Hulk out.\n \n \n \n \n \nHulk\n fights against \nAbomination\n \n \nDespite his fears that he has cured himself of Hulk permanently, Banner is given permission to fight Blonsky and jumps from General Ross' helicopter in an attempt to re-trigger his transformations. Banner emerges from a crater in the street below as Hulk, and \nproceeds to face Blonsky\n. Hulk manages to defeat Blonsky after a lengthy, destructive and harsh fight while also protecting Betty and General Ross, who had been put in harm's way, but is again forced to run from the US Army.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n attempts to recuit \nAbomination\n \n \nThirty one days later, Banner is in \nBella Coola\n, \nBritish Columbia\n trying to learn how to control his transformations, instead of curing them. Later, \nTony Stark\n arrives at a \nbar\n, where he finds a drunken and defeated General Ross. Upon acknowledging the recent battle in Harlem, the two discuss a \"\nteam\n\" being put together.\nCast\n[\n]\nEdward Norton\n as \nBruce Banner/Hulk\nLiv Tyler\n as \nBetty Ross\nTim Roth\n as \nEmil Blonsky/Abomination\nWilliam Hurt\n as General \nThaddeus Ross\nTim Blake Nelson\n as \nSamuel Sterns\nTy Burrell\n as \nLeonard Samson\nChristina Cabot\n as Major \nKathleen Sparr\nPeter Mensah\n as General \nJoe Greller\nLou Ferrigno\n as \nSecurity Guard\n / \nHulk\n \n(voice)\nPaul Soles\n as \nStanley Lieber\nDbora Nascimento\n as \nMartina\nGreg Bryk\n as \nCraig Saunders, Jr.\nAlan Vrkljan\n as \nJohn Armbruster\nAdrian Hein\n as \nSamuel LaRoquette\nPedro Salvn\n as \nSilva\nJoris Jarsky\n as \nDelta 4\nArnold Pinnock\n as \nSterling\nMaxwell McCabe-Lokos\n as \nHarlem Cab Driver\nDavid Collins\n as \nThomas\nJohn Carvalho\n as \nMarcos de Souza\nMartin Starr\n as \nRoger Harrington\nChris Ratz\n as \nDennis\nTamsen McDonough\n as \nMarlo Chandler\nRoberto Bakker\n as \nBezerra\nRuru Sacha\n as \nAlves\nJames Downing\n as \nMilgrom\nNicholas Rose\n as \nJack McGee\nP.J.
