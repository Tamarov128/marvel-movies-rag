Originally a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange got into a \ncar accident\n which resulted in his hands becoming crippled. Once Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to \nKamar-Taj\n, where he was trained by the \nAncient One\n in the ways of \nmagic\n and the \nMultiverse\n. Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into a \nconflict\n with \nKaecilius\n and the \nZealots\n, who were working for \nDormammu\n and had sought to merge \nEarth\n with the \nDark Dimension\n. Following the \ndemise\n of the Ancient One and the \ndefeat\n of Kaecilius, Strange then became the new protector of the \nSanctum Sanctorum\n, seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats.\nFrom his new position, Strange aided \nThor\n in locating \nOdin\n, before he learned of \nThanos\n' attempts to gain all of the \nInfinity Stones\n and cause a \nuniversal genocide\n. Since Strange was the protector of the \nTime Stone\n, he was \nattacked\n and captured by Thanos' \nBlack Order\n, only for him to then be \nrescued\n by \nIron Man\n and \nSpider-Man\n. Joining forces with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, Strange battled against Thanos. However, as Strange had seen into the future and knew his only path to victory, he willingly handed over the Time Stone, allowing Thanos to \nwipe out half of life\n, including Strange. However, Strange and all the rest of Thanos' victims were \nresurrected\n \nfive years later\n by the \nAvengers\n and \nbattled\n against an \nalternate Thanos\n, ending in the Mad Titan's defeat.\nA year later\n, Strange offered his aid to Spider-Man, whose identity of \nPeter Parker\n was unmasked by \nMysterio\n, as he asked Strange to make the world forget this. However, due to Parker's interference, the \nspell\n went wrong, and Strange inadvertently \nunleashed\n enemies of \nSpider-\nMen\n from across the \nMultiverse\n. Capturing these enemies, Strange tried to use the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n to send them back to their universes to meet their inevitable fates, which Spider-Man had refused to allow, hoping to give these people a chance at redemption. Having been trapped in the \nMirror Dimension\n during a \nduel\n with Spider-Man, Strange returned and fought to contain the Multiversal rift. With no other choice, Strange cast a spell to return the visitors back to their universes and close the rifts, but also at the cost of making everyone, including himself, forget Parker's existence.\nBeing heralded of \nnew interdimensional threats\n, Strange came across \nAmerica Chavez\n. While investigating these threats, Strange learned that \nWanda Maximoff\n, who fell under the influence of the \nDarkhold\n, was responsible. As Kamar-Taj fell under \nattack\n by her, Chavez sent Strange spiraling through the multiverse, where they were eventually arrested by the \nIlluminati\n. With the help of an \nalternate Christine Palmer\n, Strange and Chavez escaped, only for Maximoff to abduct Chavez, banishing Strange and Palmer to an \nincursion\n-inflicted universe. Confronting that reality's \nDoctor Strange\n, Strange claimed the \nDarkhold\n, utilizing \ndreamwalking\n in order to rescue Chavez. Helping her gain full control of her powers, the two swayed Maximoff from the Darkhold's influence, before her \napparent self-sacrifice\n to destroy all copies of the Darkhold throughout the Multiverse. In the aftermath, Strange and \nWong\n took Chavez, who decided to stay in their universe, under their care and taught her in the Mystic Arts. Sometime later, Strange was confronted by \nClea\n, a sorceress who enlisted his help in fixing a new incursion he had caused.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nDeath of Donna Strange\n1.1.2\n \nMedical School\n1.2\n \nNeurosurgeon Career\n1.2.1\n \nBecoming a Doctor\n1.2.2\n \nDinner with Christine Palmer\n1.2.3\n \nInterview with WHiH\n1.2.4\n \nTop of the World\n1.2.5\n \nFall from Grace\n1.2.6\n \nSearching for a Cure\n1.3\n \nTrained in Magic\n1.3.1\n \nMeeting the Ancient One\n1.3.2\n \nBeginning Training\n1.3.3\n \nMastering the Sling Ring\n1.3.4\n \nGaining Confidence\n1.3.5\n \nTraining with Karl Mordo\n1.3.6\n \nUsing an Infinity Stone\n1.4\n \nConflict with Kaecilius\n1.4.1\n \nDefending the New York Sanctum\n1.4.2\n \nKaecilius' Confession\n1.4.3\n \nDuel on the Astral Plane\n1.4.4\n \nDemanding the Truth\n1.4.5\n \nBattle in the Mirror Dimension\n1.4.6\n \nLosing the Ancient One\n1.4.7\n \nRecruiting Karl Mordo\n1.4.8\n \nDefending the Hong Kong Sanctum\n1.4.9\n \nMaking a Bargain\n1.5\n \nNew Protector\n1.5.1\n \nGuarding the Sanctum\n1.5.2\n \nLearning of the Infinity Stones\n1.5.3\n \nLocating Odin\n1.5.4\n \nUnauthorized Biography\n1.5.5\n \nDefeating Kalkartho\n1.6\n \nInfinity War\n1.6.1\n \nLearning of Thanos\n1.6.2\n \nKidnapped by the Black Order\n1.6.3\n \nTortured by Ebony Maw\n1.6.4\n \nEncountering the Guardians\n1.6.5\n \nBattle of Titan\n1.6.6\n \nShowdown with Thanos\n1.6.7\n \nThanos' Victory\n1.6.8\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.6.9\n \nTony Stark's Funeral\n1.7\n \n\"Friendship\" with Scott Lang\n1.8\n \nMultiversal Crisis\n1.8.1\n \nHelping Peter Parker\n1.8.2\n \nCapturing Multiversal Visitors\n1.8.3\n \nConflict with Spider-Man\n1.8.4\n \nBattle at Liberty Island\n1.8.5\n \nDreams\n1.8.6\n \nChristine Palmer's Wedding\n1.8.7\n \nBattle Against Gargantos\n1.8.8\n \nMeeting the Multiversal Traveler\n1.9\n \nMore Multiversal Problems\n1.9.1\n \nMeeting with Wanda Maximoff\n1.9.2\n \nSiege of Kamar-Taj\n1.9.3\n \nTrip Through the Multiverse\n1.9.4\n \nStranded on Earth-838\n1.9.5\n \nTrial by the Illuminati\n1.9.6\n \nAttack on the Illuminati Headquarters\n1.9.7\n \nEntering the Gap Junction\n1.9.8\n \nFighting a Corrupted Strange\n1.9.9\n \nBattle on Mount Wundagore\n1.9.10\n \nAftermath\n1.10\n \nMultiversal Duties\n1.10.1\n \nStopping an Incursion\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nFormer Powers\n3.3\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nOther Equipment\n4.2\n \nFormer Equipment\n4.3\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nFacilities\n6\n \nRelationships\n6.1\n \nFamily\n6.2\n \nAllies\n6.3\n \nEnemies\n7\n \nAppearances\n8\n \nTrivia\n9\n \nBehind the Scenes\n10\n \nReferences\n11\n \nExternal Links\nQuick Answers\nWho is Doctor Strange?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDoctor Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D., also known as Doctor Strange, is a powerful sorcerer and Master of the Mystic Arts from Marvel Comics who featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He was once a brilliant yet arrogant neurosurgeon before suffering a car accident in 2016 which left him unable to practice medicine. He then went on to study magic and became a powerful sorcerer. He was in several MCU films, including the Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, What If...?, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by: Fandom\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIs Doctor Strange 3 happening?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere has been no announcement for a third Doctor Strange film as of September 2023.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by: Fandom\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoes Doctor Stranger have a happy ending?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the MCU is currently ongoing, the nature of Doctor Strange's ending is unknown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by: Fandom\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDo Doctor Strange's hands ever heal?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite spending his entire fortune on experimental treatments, Doctor Strange's hands were unable to be repaired, as nerve damage can't simply be reattached. However, with the help of the Ancient One, Strange learned to heal his soul and gain magical abilities to erect barriers against enemies and fight back, thus helping him protect the world from Kaecilius and his Zealots' evil plans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by: Fandom\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWhy is he called Dr Strange?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStephen Strange was a world-class neurosurgeon in New York City, and so he has the title Doctor. Although he no longer practices medicine after his car accident, he is still called Doctor Strange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by: Fandom\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBiography\n[\n]\nThis is an in-depth biography of Doctor Strange. For an abridged overview, see \nMarvel Database's article on the same character\n.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nDeath of Donna Strange\n[\n]\n\"We had a sister. \nDonna\n. She died when we were kids.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"We were playing on a frozen lake and... she fell through the ice. I couldn't save her.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nDoctor Strange\n[src]\nStephen Strange had a sister named \nDonna\n, who drowned after falling into a frozen lake. Unable to save his sister, Strange decided to become a doctor to save lives.\n[\n3\n]\nMedical School\n[\n]\n\"How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone?\"\n\"Study and practice. Years of it.\"\n\nAncient One\n and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nStrange went to medical school at \nColumbia University\n, and eventually graduated with an M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time, using his photographic memory to learn all of the information incredibly quickly.\n[\n1\n]\nNeurosurgeon Career\n[\n]\nBecoming a Doctor\n[\n]\n\"I'm using trans-sectioned spinal cords to stimulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system. My work is at least going to save thousands for years to come.\"\nStephen Strange to \nChristine Palmer\n[src]\nAs an adult, Strange had begun specializing in neurological surgery and focusing his research on the formation of new nerve cells. Strange eventually became attracted to \nChristine Palmer\n, a fellow surgeon who had worked alongside him in the ER department of \nMetro-General Hospital\n where together they successfully invented a laminectomy procedure, something which Strange tried to take full credit for and even have named after him. The two later began a relationship; it did not last due to Strange's arrogance and his focus on his career, but the two continued to work with each other and remained friends, with Palmer even gifting him a watch.\n[\n1\n]\nIn \n2012\n, Stephen Strange was present in \nNew York City\n during the \nChitauri Invasion\n,\n[\n8\n]\n performing a surgery at the hospital about twenty blocks from the \nNew York Sanctum\n.\n[\n9\n]\n In \n2014\n, Strange was deemed a potential threat to \nHYDRA\n, whose intent was to deploy \nZola's Algorithm\n and eliminate the threats from the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \nHelicarriers\n. Thanks to the efforts of \nSteve Rogers\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n, and \nSam Wilson\n who thwarted HYDRA's plan during the \nBattle at the Triskelion\n, Strange survived.\n[\n10\n]\n By \n2016\n, he was one of the top surgeons in New York City, being scheduled on discussing life-saving techniques on an interview with \nWHiH World News\n.\n[\n11\n]\n However, Strange became more egotistical as his skills and craft increased.\n[\n1\n]\nDinner with Christine Palmer\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange has dinner with \nChristine Palmer\n \n \n\"This is pretty fancy. Did you have to take out another student loan?\"\n\"Nah, I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.\"\n\nChristine Palmer\n and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nStrange took \nChristine Palmer\n out to dinner, at a restaurant which Palmer noted was surprisingly fancy, questioning if Strange had taken out another student loan to pay for it, to which Strange jokingly claimed to have sold a kidney that they had operated on the week before. Palmer then presented Strange with a gift, telling him congratulations, which Strange questioned what it was.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange opens a gift from \nChristine Palmer\n \n \nAs Strange opened the box, he was shocked to see that Palmer had gifted him with an expensive watch, which had been engraved in the back with a message, telling Strange that time would tell how much Palmer loved him. Strange expressed his shock and gratitude to Palmer for the gift. Strange would go on to wear this watch as often as possible, despite building an expensive watch collection later in his life.\n[\n3\n]\nInterview with WHiH\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange interviewed with \nChristine Palmer\n \n \n\"Who are you, really, Doctor Strange?\"\n\"Look, if it's you, or someone you love who's on that operating table, and it's life or death, I'm the one you want holding the knife.\"\nInterviewer and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nWhile working at \nMetro-General Hospital\n, Strange and \nChristine Palmer\n developed a revolutionary technique for removing a vertebral bone, which would contribute to allowing paralyzed patients to walk again. This technique became known as the Strange Palmer method. Strange and Palmer would sit down for an interview with \nWHiH World News\n to discuss their work, with Strange reluctantly sharing the credit with Palmer, although noting that he usually did his best work alone.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange defending his work as a Doctor\n \n \nWhen asked who the real brains were, Strange deflected from answering the question, with Palmer noting that they made a great team. When Palmer noted Strange was one of the best surgeons alive, Strange insisted he was the best, noting that Palmer was as well. However, the interviewer questioned if Strange's dedications to well-paid speaking engagements were his true focus, which Strange refuted, with Strange becoming annoyed and insisting that he was simply the one you would want holding the knife during a surgery.\n[\n12\n]\nTop of the World\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor Strange prepares for an operation\n \n \n\"Now's not the time for showing off, Strange.\"\n\"How about ten minutes ago when you called the wrong time of death?\"\n\nNicodemus West\n and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nOn \nFebruary 2, 2016\n, continuing his neurosurgeon career, Strange performed another operation while at \nMetro-General Hospital\n, where he had watched a team of students who were all taking notes. While he was operating, Strange requested \nBilly\n to play music and have Strange use his impressive memory to guess the song, artist and year it had been released, which he was able to do each time, much to the great frustration of Billy and all of the other nurses.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange discusses \nChristine Palmer\n's work\n \n \nOnce he had completed yet another successful surgery, Strange was asked by his friend \nChristine Palmer\n to help with a patient who had been shot in a firefight. Leaving his nurses to finish with the operation without him, Strange met with Palmer outside the operating room where she presented the x-ray of her patient. While Strange joked that clearly, the issue she was having was that the patient had a bullet inside his head, Strange suddenly realized there was something wrong.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange insisting \nNicodemus West\n is wrong\n \n \nDespite \nNicodemus West\n's objections, who wanted to start recovering the patient's organs immediately, Strange found a perfectly intact bullet and realized that it had been hardened by a poison that caused the patient to fail reflexes tests and enter a death-like state. Realizing Doctor West misdiagnosed brain death in the patient, Strange and Palmer rushed to stop West and prepared to perform immediate surgery to try and remove the bullet.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange successfully removes the bullet\n \n \nAlthough West requested to assist Strange in the operation, he refused the offer and instead told Palmer to come to assist him. As the operation went underway, Palmer thanked Strange for believing her. He prepared to remove the bullet freehand without the use of a machine, as there was such little time. Demanding absolute silence, which included West being told to cover his watch, Strange eventually managed to find and remove the bullet.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nChristine Palmer\n talk and flirt\n \n \nImmediately following the successful surgery, Palmer questioned if Strange really needed to humiliate West in front of all of the other doctors, although Strange confidently noted that he did not have to save West's own patient either, but sometimes he just could not help himself. When Palmer continued to defend West and called him a great doctor, Strange asked Palmer if she and West were sleeping together, claiming that the mere concept disgusted him. Palmer then denied the accusation, stating it was against the \"Strange Policy,\" a policy against dating coworkers, which she named after him, which still pleased Strange to have something named after him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asking \nChristine Palmer\n to join him\n \n \nThey briefly discussed the laminectomy procedure they had invented together, with Strange still complaining that it had not been named after him yet. Strange proceeded to tell Palmer that he was set to speak at an \nAmerican Neurological Association\n dinner later that night and invited her to accompany him. Palmer declined, stating that she never enjoyed going to speaking engagements and that the reason he went was that it boosted his already absurdly large ego.\n[\n1\n]\nFall from Grace\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange prepares to go to a speaking dinner\n \n \n\"Give your body time to heal.\" \n \"You've ruined me...\"\n\nNicodemus West\n and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nThe same day, despite the rejection from \nChristine Palmer\n, Strange prepared himself to attend the dinner alone, going through his \napartment\n to put on a new tux and pick the perfect watch to wear, one that was gifted to him by Palmer while they were in a relationship. Now dressed and ready to go, Strange got into his \nLamborghini Huracn\n and drove through \nNew York City\n at high speed with little regard for his safety, eventually traveling on a cliffside road in dark and rainy conditions, still at high speed. \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange speaks to \nBilly\n about new patients\n \n \nStrange received a phone call from his colleague \nBilly\n, who had come across three new potential surgeries, including a thirty-five-year-old \nAir Force\n colonel who had crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor and a sixty-eight-year-old woman with an advanced brain stem glioma. After turning down the first two which he deemed below his talent, Strange eventually showed interest in a schizophrenic who had been struck by lightning.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is involved in a major \ncar crash\n \n \nAs Strange took his eyes off the road to view the patient's records, becoming interested in the x-ray Billy had sent him, he collided with another vehicle. Unable to do anything to save himself, Strange's hands were forced into the dashboard and crushed beyond repair by the impact. His car flew straight off the road before \ncrashing\n into a nearby riverbank. Trapped in the wreckage, Strange lay in utter agony and eventually lost consciousness.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange taken to hospital after the accident\n \n \nHaving eventually been found in the wreckage of his own car after a desperate search, Strange was immediately rushed to \nMetro-General Hospital\n and underwent a surgery that lasted eleven hours, overseen by Palmer and \nNicodemus West\n. Although his life had been saved due to the emergency surgery, both of Strange's hands had now suffered permanent nerve damage which had forced West to use eleven stainless steel pins inside of the bones.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange awakes while still in the hospital\n \n \nWhen Strange woke up the following day while in his hospital bed, he found Palmer waiting by his side. As he looked in horror, Strange discovered that his hands were terribly scarred and learned from Palmer that both of his hands suffered severe nerve damage and were rendered inoperable. When Palmer insisted that nobody else could have done a better job for him, Strange still insisted that he could have done better.\n[\n1\n]\nSearching for a Cure\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange claims \nNicodemus West\n ruined him \n \n \n\"Pass the stent under the brachial artery under the radial artery.\"\n\"It's possible. Experimental, and expensive, but possible.\"\n\"All I need is possible.\"\nStephen Strange and Medical Board Member\n[src]\nEventually, Strange's bandages on his hands were removed and he finally attempted simply to part all his fingers, however, this proved almost impossible due to the pain it caused and the amount his hands shook. \nNicodemus West\n advised Strange to allow his body to heal, but Strange then furiously accused West of ruining his body and his career as a neurosurgeon.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attempts to find a cure for himself\n \n \nUpon being released from \nMetro-General Hospital\n, Strange focused his efforts on finding a way to cure his own hands, pushing for new experimental treatments. Strange had soon spent most of his money on seven different operations as well as numerous other rehabilitation techniques, but all soon proved to be unsuccessful. With each new attempt, he was forced to sell up his lavish lifestyle and belongings to fund the operations, leaving him with little left to his name.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange undergoing his physical therapies\n \n \nWhile undergoing his physical therapy, Strange was instructed to open his fingers using a brace, something he still found to be almost impossible to do without causing himself great pain. While Strange complained to his physical therapist about how unlikely it was that he would ever fix this nerve damage, the therapist gave an example of one \npatient\n he had treated who had seemingly cured himself of a paralyzed spine, which Strange refused to believe was possible.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange's next medical concept is rejected\n \n \nOne day while in his \napartment\n, Strange was on a video call with a doctor who stated that he cannot help him and turned him down, angering him to where he threw his tablet across the room. While Strange was still fuming, \nChristine Palmer\n came to his apartment trying to convince him to stop wasting all his money on his hands, as well as telling him to move on by assuring him that there were other ways to save lives and live his own to the fullest with her help.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange allowing \nChristine Palmer\n to leave\n \n \nStrange did not want to move on but find a way to restore his hands so he could return to his former life as a neurosurgeon, claiming there was an experimental procedure in \nTokyo\n he wished to try as it could be an opportunity to fix his hands and return to his life. Becoming more frustrated and angrier, Strange then lashed out at Palmer by stating that she was only pitying him because she loved a sob story which Strange saw himself as. This hurt Palmer who then demanded that he apologize, but he refused, stating that she should leave.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learning about \nJonathan Pangborn\n \n \nPalmer left him and walked out of his life, leaving the now-alone and frustrated Strange to look out over \nNew York City\n and consider all the decisions he had made and what he was going to do next. While he was picking up the papers he had thrown on the ground in a rage, Strange eventually found a letter from his physical therapist with the documents on \nJonathan Pangborn\n, the paraplegic who had regained the ability to walk again, which seemed to confirm his story.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks for \nJonathan Pangborn\n's help\n \n \nWhen the instructor sent him Pangborn's file, Strange tracked him down and found him playing a game of basketball with his friends, seemingly in top physical condition. Despite his initial reluctance due to Strange having refused to take him as a patient before, Pangborn agreed to help when Strange revealed his damaged hands. Pangborn told Strange the source of his healing, leading him to \nKamar-Taj\n and the \nAncient One\n, and wishing him good luck on his quest.\n[\n1\n]\nTrained in Magic\n[\n]\nMeeting the Ancient One\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange searches everywhere for \nKamar-Taj\n \n \n\"I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter and nothing more. You're just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe.\"\n\"You think too little of yourself.\"\n\"Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don't!\"\nStephen Strange and \nAncient One\n[src]\nSpending the last of his money on a ticket to \nNepal\n, Strange began his search for \nKamar-Taj\n. Without any knowledge of where it was located or even what Kamar-Taj was, Strange resorted to simply asking any person he passed if they could give him the information.\n[\n1\n]\n While walking through the back streets, Strange encountered a hurt dog and decided to stop and give it a makeshift bandage for his leg, joking he would be charging the dog for the treatment.\n[\n13\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is offered help from \nKarl Mordo\n \n \nHe was then cornered in an alley by three thugs who attempted to rob him, despite Strange insisting that he did not have any money. The thugs demanded his expensive watch, which Strange refused as it was a gift from \nChristine Palmer\n, so he tried to defend himself only to be beaten up by the thugs. However, Strange was rescued by \nKarl Mordo\n, a student of the \nAncient One\n who promised to bring him to Kamar-Taj as Strange had wanted.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange finally meeting the \nAncient One\n \n \nMordo led Strange into Kamar-Taj, which was not the mystic location he was expected as he joked about it. Mordo warned him not to be disrespectful and to forget everything he thought he knew. Inside, Strange initially mistook an \nelderly man\n for the Ancient One before he was introduced to the true Sorcerer Supreme, who presented him with tea and welcomed him to their world. Strange began asking how she helped \nJonathan Pangborn\n to heal his broken body.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is thrown into the \nAstral Dimension\n \n \nAt first, Strange believed they were researching cell regeneration but quickly became skeptical of her methods of curing Pangborn as she claimed she and the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n had healed Pangborn through his spirit. Strange became angry, declaring that she was now wasting his time, noting that he had spent all his money to find her and cure his hands, claiming that he saw through her lies, before she then pushed his astral form out his body to present him with his first experience of the \nAstral Dimension\n, much to Strange's horror.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being sent through the \nMultiverse\n \n \nStrange was shocked but denied what just happened, thinking he had been drugged, although the Ancient One insisted all she gave him was tea with a little honey, which Strange doubted. Seeking to show him more of what she could offer, the Ancient One then sent Strange through the \nMultiverse\n, showing him the various realities before dragging him back when Mordo claimed that his heart rate was spiking, although the Ancient One said he was fine.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange floating throughout the \nMultiverse\n \n \nStrange was sent back through the Multiverse where he was told that the reality he knew was simply one of many. The Ancient One spoke to him while he was still being flung across all the different realities, challenging him to open his eyes to these possibilities while he had visions of the \nQuantum Realm\n as well as the \nDark Dimension\n, seeing a glance of the terrifying \nDormammu\n. The Ancient One made Strange question who he was within this multiverse, while he encountered sights and senses beyond his wildest imaginations.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange begs the \nAncient One\n to teach him\n \n \nHaving experienced something was unexplainable, Strange was then back into the room within Kamar-Taj where he fell to the feet of the Ancient One, to questioned if he had ever had an experience like that in a gift shop. Barely recovering from the revelations shown to him, Strange remained on his knees and begged her to teach him how to do this, but she refused and then had him cast out because of his previous disrespect towards her and their ways.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is thrown back out onto the streets\n \n \nThrown out on to the streets of \nNepal\n, Strange was unable to stop the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n from locking the door behind them and trapping him outside. Seeing this as his last chance, Strange charged back at the door and screamed out at the Ancient One and Mordo to please let him back inside. Strange then spent the next five hours banging on the door and begging to be let back inside until finally, Mordo had changed the Ancient One's mind.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is shown to his room by \nKarl Mordo\n \n \nOnce back inside, Strange was shown into his room by Mordo who advised Strange to use his time to rest and meditate until the Ancient One had called for him in the morning. When Strange was handed a piece of paper reading \nShamballa\n, he questioned if this was now his mantra, to which Mordo explained that it was their Wi-Fi password. Once alone, Strange removed his now-broken watch and read the message \nChristine Palmer\n had engraved on the back.\n[\n1\n]\nBeginning Training\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns magic from the \nAncient One\n \n \n\"Even if my fingers could do that, my hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there?\"\nDoctor Strange to \nAncient One\n[src]\nThe next morning, Strange sat down with the \nAncient One\n who began to explain how the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n drew their power from other dimensions within the \nMultiverse\n, which allowed them to shape reality, explaining how \nJonathan Pangborn\n used his \nmagic\n to move his body, and that she planned for Strange to learn how to do the same with his hands. When Strange asked how he could gain these new skills with his damaged hands, the Ancient One compared it to Strange's studies to become a world-renowned doctor.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is introduced to the librarian \nWong\n \n \nSeeking to better his understanding, Strange went to the library to take out several books on the concept of magic. There, he met the librarian \nWong\n, who Strange began mocking for his refusal to smile and his single name, comparing him to \nAdele\n and \nEminem\n. As Wong expressed his great surprise that Strange had read so many complex books on the Mystic Arts, he invited him to a deeper section of the library to study some of the more detailed books, with Strange questioning how \nKamar-Taj\n worked in terms of knowledge.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nWong\n discuss the Mystic Arts\n \n \nStrange then asked if he could read the \nBook of Cagliostro\n, to which Wong said that while no knowledge was off limits in Kamar-Taj, some was too dangerous for a new student like he currently was and therefore Strange was not permitted to read it. Strange noted how the book was missing a page, Wong explained that the previous \nKamar-Taj Librarian\n had been killed by \nKaecilius\n and his \nZealots\n before Wong threatened Strange not to take books without permission, to which Strange simply teased him, questioning the punishment for late fees, before returning to his room to continue studying.\n[\n1\n]\nMastering the Sling Ring\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange trains under \nKarl Mordo\n's watch\n \n \n\"I control it by surrendering control? That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\"Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise.\"\nStephen Strange and \nAncient One\n[src]\nStrange began his training with all of the other students under the watchful eye of \nKarl Mordo\n but struggled initially, finding himself disappointingly unable to create a \nportal\n using the \nSling Ring\n which the other trainees appeared to have no issue doing. Becoming more frustrated as he continued to fail, Strange told the \nAncient One\n that he believed that the shaking in his hands was the cause. Not accepting this excuse, the Ancient One invited Master \nHamir\n to demonstrate his own skill.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is transported to \nMount Everest\n \n \nRevealing that Hamir was missing a hand but was still able to use his power regardless, the Ancient One made it clear that Strange could do the same thing if given more practice and confidence in his own abilities as a sorcerer. Deciding that Strange needed more pressure to improve his skills, the Ancient One created her own portal and then took Strange to the top of \nMount Everest\n where Strange was bewildered by his surroundings.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange successfully returns to \nKamar-Taj\n \n \nWearing only thin clothing, the Ancient One told Strange that the only way he would be able to return to \nKamar-Taj\n before he froze to death was to successfully use his \nSling Ring\n, before she left him behind, much to Strange's horror. Despite still struggling at first and succumbing to the turbulent weather, Strange was able to concentrate hard enough to successfully create a portal and landed back at Kamar-Taj, and mastering this new technique, much to the Ancient One and Mordo's amusement as he fell onto his face before them.\n[\n1\n]\nGaining Confidence\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange gains his confidence in his studies\n \n \n\"Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I'm being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.\"\n\"Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?\"\nDoctor Strange and \nAncient One\n[src]\nWith this achievement, Strange gained the confidence that he could have the skills to become a sorcerer. Strange successfully managed to shave his beard down, giving himself a new look before he went to the library and asked \nWong\n for some new books, jokingly calling him \nBeyonc\n; however, Wong still believed that Strange was not ready for the books.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange continues reading while sleeping\n \n \nWhen Wong refused to hand over the books, Strange took it upon himself to use his \nSling Ring\n to take books from the library behind Wong's back, though he quickly found out. With the books borrowed from Wong, Strange studied in his sleep using the \nAstral Dimension\n and progressed rapidly in his studies over the following months,\n[\n1\n]\n also emailing \nChristine Palmer\n whenever he could to try and repair the friendship he had so badly damaged just before he had left. Strange then learned how to master the Astral Projection.\n[\n14\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is taken into the \nMirror Dimension\n \n \nWhile his studies were becoming even more impressive, Strange also began questioning many of the rules presented to him in \nKamar-Taj\n and started teaching himself. As a result, the \nAncient One\n invited Strange to use the \nMirror Dimension\n to study where he could not affect the real world. While she presented this dimension to him, the Ancient One warned of the threats like \nKaecilius\n where this dimension could protect lives from any of the \nZealots\n' sudden attacks.\n[\n1\n]\n As he continued to study, he read about \nBaelzar\n and became very interested in the sorcerer.\n[\n15\n]\nTraining with Karl Mordo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange has fight training with \nKarl Mordo\n \n \n\"So, just how ancient is \nshe\n?\"\n\"No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.\"\n\"You follow her even though you don't know?\"\nStephen Strange and \nKarl Mordo\n[src]\nStepping back onto the courtyard of \nKamar-Taj\n, Strange began his fight training with \nKarl Mordo\n. He questioned Mordo about the \nAncient One\n, asking her true age. Mordo explained that nobody knew the true age of the Ancient One, to which Strange questioned how he could follow someone he knew nothing about, but Mordo insisted that she was trustworthy regardless of her secrets.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attempting to summon his weapon\n \n \nAs they sparred, Strange and Mordo discussed \nKaecilius\n and why he had turned against the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n. Taking a break from fighting, Mordo explained the concept of relics, which held their power within objects rather than in the Masters themselves. Strange laughed at the complex names as Mordo introduced him to the \nStaff of the Living Tribunal\n and \nVaulting Boots of Valtorr\n and then invited Strange to conjure up his own weapon using his powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is beaten to the floor by \nKarl Mordo\n \n \nJust as Strange conjured his \nwhip\n out of pure \nmagic\n energy, Mordo proceeded to beat him into submission to prove a point, telling him that he needed to fight as if his life depended on it, as one day it may. Once back in his room later that night, Strange went back onto his tablet and wrote yet another email to \nChristine Palmer\n, hoping that she might finally reply to him so that he could make amends for all of his unfortunate actions to her and they could move forward.\n[\n1\n]\nUsing an Infinity Stone\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange trying to use the \nEye of Agamotto\n \n \n\"I was just doing exactly what it said in the \nbook\n!\"\n\"And what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual?\"\n\"Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nWong\n[src]\nIn \n2017\n, after nine total months of training, Strange walked inside the library only to find \nWong\n was not there. Strange then took the chance to read the \nBook of Cagliostro\n and decided to use the \nEye of Agamotto\n. Strange experimented with its power by making an apple regrow and then rot, discovering the Eye had given him control over time itself in the process. Strange also recreated the missing page on the book, which made him realize how The \nAncient One\n remained young.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is stopped by \nWong\n and \nKarl Mordo\n \n \nWong and \nKarl Mordo\n stumbled into Strange's experiment and both warned him not to bend fundamental natural laws so haphazardly, noting that misuse of items of such incredible power, like the Eye, could cause Strange to become trapped in a time loop forever as a result. Upon hearing this, Strange awkwardly recommended that the warnings should be put in front of the spells, not after. When asked how he had performed such a difficult spell for an early level trainee of the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n, Strange explained that he had used his photographic memory before questioning what the purpose of the Masters was as this had never been explained to him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange dispells the information told to him\n \n \nTaking Strange into the next room, Wong and Mordo explained how they would protect the \nEarth\n from mystical threats in much the same way that the \nAvengers\n would protect it from physical ones. Strange questioned if one of these great threats was \nDormammu\n, noting how he had read of Dormammu in the book. Wong then explained how Dormammu came from the \nDark Dimension\n and sought to consume the Earth and rule over the entire \nMultiverse\n to become all powerful.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is suddenly ambushed by \nKaecilius\n \n \nStrange initially refused to fight in a \"mystic war\" before the \nLondon Sanctum\n was attacked by \nKaecilius\n, with the corpse of \nSol Rama\n, the Sanctum's protector, dropping at their feet. The Sanctum was then destroyed, and the explosion ripped through \nKamar-Taj\n and knocked everybody off their feet, trapping Strange in the \nNew York Sanctum\n based within \nNew York City\n as he became separated from all of his allies and was now unable to return to Kamar-Taj.\n[\n1\n]\nConflict with Kaecilius\n[\n]\nDefending the New York Sanctum\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange finds himself within \nNew York City\n \n \n\"How long have you been at \nKamar-Taj\n, Mister...?\"\n\"Doctor.\"\n\"Mister Doctor?\"\n\"It's Strange.\"\n\nKaecilius\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nFinding himself in a new location in \nNew York City\n due to just being thrown through the \nportal\n, Strange walked throughout the \nNew York Sanctum\n looking for anybody and had soon discovered the \nRotunda of Gateways\n, as well as the \nCloak of Levitation\n, which had seemed to acknowledge him, during his time looking around all of the corridors and searching around for someone to help him get back.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange confronts \nKaecilius\n and the \nZealots\n \n \nHowever, Strange soon heard some commotion and when he went to investigate, he discovered \nKaecilius\n and all his \nZealots\n attacking the building, with Kaecilius seemingly having gained the ability to fold space and matter outside of the \nMirror Dimension\n. While watching from a safe distance, Strange witnessed \nDaniel Drumm\n, the guardian of the Sanctum, being murdered by Kaecilius and made his presence known to the attackers but was too late to save Drumm.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange fights against all of the \nZealots\n \n \nKaecilius initially mistook Strange's name for Mister Doctor as they awkwardly greeted each other, but soon forgot this and attacked him in order to complete his plan to bring \nDormammu\n to \nEarth\n. Strange fought back against the Zealots as they all charged towards him as a unit, using his \nSling Ring\n to create \nwhips\n that stopped their attacks and beat them back as he had been taught to do by \nKarl Mordo\n, at one point using the whip to grab hold of a lamp which he threw at his attackers before attempting to run away for his life.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to defend himself with magic\n \n \nAs Strange attempted to run through the hallway, however, Kaecilius used his own \nmagic\n to manipulate the hallway and keep Strange from getting away, forcing Strange to continue defending himself. Using all of the \nAncient One\n's techniques, Strange created \nshields\n for himself, although he had trouble controlling them as he lost control over one. Kaecilius' zealots then attacked Strange, who managed to defend himself for a time, until Kaecilius used his magic to twist the hallway, causing Strange to be thrown painfully against the walls before having to hold on as it was then turned vertically.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being forced to fight \nLucian Aster\n \n \nSeeing an opportunity, Strange used the Rotunda of Gateways he had found earlier to throw \none disciple\n in the desert. With limited time to trap the Zealot within the desert with no way back, Strange attempted to lock the door, only for another Zealot, \nLucian Aster\n, to attack him. Using his wits, Strange gained the upper hand and locked the door before trapping Aster in the jungle, leaving only himself and Kaecilius inside the New York Sanctum to continue fighting.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries and fails to outwit \nKaecilius\n \n \nAs they continued to fight throughout the Sanctum, the desperate Strange soon found himself being overpowered by the highly-trained Kaecilius and at one point attempted to intimidate Kaecilius by using the \nBrazier of Bom'Galiath\n, only to have to eventually admit that he did not know how to use it as a weapon and instead threw it at his head. Believing that their fight would soon be over, Kaecilius began knocking Strange through all of the glass containers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is helped by the \nCloak of Levitation\n \n \nStrange was soon knocked into the Cloak of Levitation's container, which then proceeded to save Strange's life as it began deflecting all of the \nSpace-Time Shards\n that Kaecilius had continued to attack him with. Frustrated by this, Kaecilius threw Strange off the balcony, only for the Cloak to wrap itself around his shoulders and lift Doctor Strange back into the fight, where he created another energy whip and continued fighting against Kaecilius with all of his remaining might.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange casts a weapon to battle \nKaecilius\n \n \nDoctor Strange then used the cloak to fight Kaecilius until he was again overpowered and thrown across the room. While Doctor Strange attempted to charge towards his enemy to continue fighting with their abilities, the Cloak of Levitation instead pulled him backward, away from Kaecilius and towards weapons that were on display. However, when Doctor Strange attempted to grab these weapons to attack his enemy, the Cloak had instead pulled him away with some aggression, forcing Doctor Strange to use the other artifact against Kaecilius and trap him with the \nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\n, finally ending the fight.\n[\n1\n]\nKaecilius' Confession\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange speaks to the captured \nKaecilius\n \n \n\"What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?\"\n\"The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything.\"\n\"What about the people you killed?\"\nDoctor Strange and \nKaecilius\n[src]\nWith \nKaecilius\n incapable of defending himself, Strange explained that his name was Doctor Strange, not Mister Doctor. Seeing that Strange was a Doctor, Kaecilius explained how the laws of nature declared that all things would die, but insisted that within the \nDark Dimension\n, this was not the case. Although Doctor Strange tried to gag Kaecilius in order to shut him up, he went on to insist that the \nEarth\n did not have to die, but could instead join \nDormammu\n and live forever.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange's faith in the \nAncient One\n is tested\n \n \nAs Doctor Strange listened, Kaecilius explained the \nZealots\n' plan was to thrust reality with the Dark Dimension, giving themselves and all lives on Earth eternal life. Kaecilius then told Doctor Strange that the \nAncient One\n dabbled in magic from the Dark Dimension, which is what gave her long lasting life, noting that Doctor Strange himself had not come to \nKamar-Taj\n to fight with the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n but instead intended to save his hands, something the Ancient One had failed to do.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being stabbed by \nLucian Aster\n \n \nAs Doctor Strange began to take note of these warnings about the Ancient One and Dormammu's power, Kaecilius began to laugh. Doctor Strange questioned if he found all of this funny before Kaecilius noted that Doctor Strange's \nSling Ring\n was missing. Just as Doctor Strange turned around to look for the ring, however, \nLucian Aster\n made it back through the \nRotunda of Gateways\n and stabbed him through the chest with a \nSpace-Time Shard\n, almost killing Strange before throwing him down the stairs.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to escape from \nLucian Aster\n \n \nAs he attempted to escape, Strange was followed closely by Aster who smiled as Strange was forced to slowly crawl away from his attacker. Just as Aster attempted to conjure another Space-Time Shard and finish off Strange, the \nCloak of Levitation\n again came to his aid, wrapping itself around Aster's face and keeping him from killing Strange. While this confrontation happened, Strange chose to seek out \nChristine Palmer\n at the \nMetro-General Hospital\n.\n[\n1\n]\nDuel on the Astral Plane\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks \nChristine Palmer\n to save him\n \n \n\"Oh, lord, oh, lord. What am I seeing?\"\n\"My astral body.\"\n\"Are you dead?\"\n\"No, Christine, but I am dying.\"\n\nChristine Palmer\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nStrange used \nLucian Aster\n's own \nSling Ring\n to transport himself into the \nMetro-General Hospital\n to find \nChristine Palmer\n and asked her to operate on him alone. Palmer began the surgery and Strange, feeling that his physical body was getting too weak, entered the \nAstral Dimension\n and used his astral form to help, shocking Palmer and leaving her bewildered, but Strange insisted they did not have time.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange \nspiritually\n fighting \nLucian Aster\n \n \nWhile Palmer attempted to save his life, Strange suddenly noticed that Aster had escaped from the \nCloak of Levitation\n, entered the Astral Dimension, and used his own astral form. Leaving Palmer to continue to keep him alive, Strange entered the Astral Dimension and \nfought against\n Aster. As they fought, they disturbed several objects in the physical world in the process while Palmer continued performing the surgery, briefly distracting \nNicodemus West\n while he was buying snacks.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange successfully killing \nLucian Aster\n \n \nBeing the superior fighter, Aster had eventually managed to gain the upper hand and knocked Strange unconscious, which resulted in his physical body's heart-stopping. While Aster attempted to finish him off, Strange's astral body was filled with energy when Palmer used a defibrillator. Ordering Palmer to do it again, Strange was able to kill Aster after being charged with a defibrillator, causing Aster's astral form to then explode from the sudden burst of energy.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tells Palmer what happened to him\n \n \nReturning into his body as Palmer finished her work on his wound, Strange explained that he had been to \nKamar-Taj\n to heal his wounds and learned \nmagic\n from the \nAncient One\n, which had allowed him to do what he could do now, although Palmer claimed this meant that he had likely joined a cult, which Strange claimed was untrue despite being amused by the idea. Strange apologized to Palmer for what he had said to her before leaving, asking for her forgiveness.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange getting helped by \nChristine Palmer\n \n \nWith his wound from the \nSpace-Time Shards\n mostly dealt with, Strange decided to return to the \nNew York Sanctum\n and to continue his fight against the \nZealots\n, although Palmer insisted that this was a bad decision. Explaining that he was still fighting against \nKaecilius\n before he could allow \nDormammu\n and the \nDark Dimension\n to take over the world, Strange then showed Palmer the \nportal\n he had previously made with his Sling Ring when he had arrived to confirm once and for all that what he had been saying was completely true. While Palmer looked on in amazement, Strange apologized and vanished through the portal to continue his fight against Kaecilius.\n[\n1\n]\nDemanding the Truth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange reclaims the \nCloak of Levitation\n \n \n\"It is Doctor Strange! Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, \nDoctor Strange\n! When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm, and I have just killed a \nman\n! I'm not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nAncient One\n[src]\nReturning to the \nNew York Sanctum\n, Strange soon found the corpse of \nLucian Aster\n lying on the ground, confirming he had been killed during the \nDuel on the Astral Plane\n. Horrified by seeing the body of the man he had killed, Strange walked away from Aster, but not first recollecting the \nCloak of Levitation\n. As Strange walked through the Sanctum, he discovered that \nKaecilius\n had successfully managed to escape the \nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\n while he had been gone.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange accuses the \nAncient One\n of lying\n \n \nStrange discovered that \nKarl Mordo\n and the \nAncient One\n had also arrived, with Mordo expressing his great surprise that the Cloak of Levitation had chosen him. Upon learning that \nDaniel Drumm\n had been killed, the Ancient One congratulated Strange for defending the Sanctum and declared him \"Master Strange\" as its new protector. Strange refused as he was supposed to save lives, not end them and could not bear killing anyone else in the wake of Aster's death.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to confront the \nAncient One\n \n \nWhile the Ancient One accused Strange of returning to his ego and his belief that he could control everything, Strange denied this before making a remark that while he could not control death, perhaps it was \nDormammu\n who could. Strange confronted the Ancient One, noting he had read the rituals in the \nBook of Cagliostro\n, which had seemed to confirm that she had been secretly over dabbling in the \nmagic\n of the \nDark Dimension\n to keep herself alive for centuries, all while telling the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n to do the opposite.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange furiously argues with \nKarl Mordo\n \n \nAlthough Mordo denied this, as he could not believe the Ancient One had been doing something so reckless and lying about it, she did not and returned to \nKamar-Taj\n, leaving Strange and Mordo. Disgusted by Strange's insults, Mordo furiously called him a coward, claiming he had just saved his own life against all the \nZealots\n and still cared for nobody but himself. Strange insisted that they did not have to kill, but Mordo told him that there was no other way to win.\n[\n1\n]\nBattle in the Mirror Dimension\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange trying to outwit and trap \nKaecilius\n \n \n\"The \nMirror Dimension\n.

While Mordo charged forward to fight him, Strange stopped Kaecilius from destroying the Sanctum, dragging them all into the \nMirror Dimension\n where they could not harm the physical world.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns he has just doomed himself\n \n \nHowever, Kaecilius remained confident and began manipulating the world around them, causing Strange and Mordo to run outside, with Strange stealing Kaecilius' \nSling Ring\n. Mordo then informed Strange that although Kaecilius could not damage the physical world, his own connection to the \nDark Dimension\n made him more powerful in there and would likely kill them both. Strange and Mordo then ran for their lives, with Kaecilius and the \nZealots\n following closely behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nKarl Mordo\n escape \nKaecilius\n \n \nDesperate to get free, Strange attempted to create a \nportal\n back to the physical world, but Kaecilius then affected the gravity within the Dimension to destroy their portals. Strange and Mordo attempted to run to safety, but Kaecilius gained the upper hand, throwing them off a building before they were saved by the \nCloak of Levitation\n and the \nVaulting Boots of Valtorr\n slowing their fall until Strange confessed to Mordo that he had indeed just made a terrible mistake.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is chased by the furious \nKaecilius\n \n \nStrange and Mordo had soon become separated by Kaecilius' world-bending powers, causing Strange to desperately escape across \nNew York City\n in an attempt to get away, with the entire landscape around him changing constantly, with Strange barely making it through with his life. Despite all of his attempts to get away, however, Kaecilius eventually managed to catch up with Strange and violently threw him to the ground, reclaiming his Sling Ring from him. While Strange lied down helpless, Kaecilius proceeded to create a new \nSpace-Time Shard\n, which he then prepared to finally kill Strange with and end their conflict.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange seeing the \nAncient One\n's final fight\n \n \nJust before Kaecilius could deliver the finishing blow and kill Strange, the \nAncient One\n arrived and pulled them apart, revealing to Mordo that her power did derive from the \nDark Dimension\n. Strange and Mordo watched the Ancient One battle against all the \nZealots\n until she was fatally stabbed by Kaecilius with a Space-Time Shard. Kaecilius then knocked her through a portal, and she fell hundreds of stories down with Strange and Mordo failing to save her from the deadly impact.\n[\n1\n]\nLosing the Ancient One\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange putting \nNicodemus West\n in charge\n \n \n\"Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the most significant lesson of all.\"\n\"Which is?\"\n\"It's not about you.\"\n\nAncient One\n to Doctor Strange\n[src]\nIn a desperate attempt to save the \nAncient One\n, Strange rushed her to \nMetro-General Hospital\n and called upon the help of \nChristine Palmer\n to try and save the Ancient One from her life-threatening injuries caused by the stabbing and fall. Unable to perform the surgery due to his shaking hands, Strange handed the scalpel back to \nNicodemus West\n and told him to relieve the pressure from her brain.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange chases the \nAncient One\n \n \nAs the Ancient One began to go into cardiac arrest, Strange noticed that the Ancient One had entered the \nAstral Dimension\n and left the room. Knowing that leaving her own body now could prove fatal, Strange entered his own astral form and followed the Ancient One as she moved through the hospital, telling her to return as she was dying; however, the Ancient One seemingly refused to listen to him and glided onto the balcony to see \nNew York City\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and the \nAncient One\n discuss \nmagic\n \n \nIgnoring Strange's pleas for her to return to her body, the Ancient One told him of how she had peered into her own future and never seen further than this very moment in time, but she had seen infinite possibilities for his future. She told him, like \nJonathan Pangborn\n, he could use his \nmagic\n to heal his hands and return to being a surgeon, which would come at a great loss to the \nEarth\n, or become a member of the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n and fight for the earth's survival.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange witnesses the \nAncient One\n's death\n \n \nShe told him about the \nDark Dimension\n and why she had drawn her power from there, claiming that Strange would agree that sometimes one had to break the rules for the better good, agreeing that \nKarl Mordo\n would not likely see it from this point of view. The Ancient One then told Strange that he could only defeat \nKaecilius\n and \nDormammu\n with Mordo's help before she commented on her own desire to see the snow falling just as her astral form vanished and she finally died.\n[\n1\n]\nRecruiting Karl Mordo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange says goodbye to \nChristine Palmer\n \n \n\"You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I cannot defeat them alone.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nKarl Mordo\n[src]\nWith the death of the \nAncient One\n, Strange pondered about his last conversation with his mentor and mourned her death before speaking with \nChristine Palmer\n as they both washed their hands. Strange then told Palmer that she was right that losing his hands did not have to be the end but a new beginning for him, and that there were other ways to save lives. Realizing that he found his new beginning in the \nMystic Arts\n, Strange decided to stay as a sorcerer and become a superhero. Strange also decided to fully leave his old life behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange prepares for his next confrontation\n \n \nWhen Palmer was called away for another surgery within \nMetro-General Hospital\n, Strange told her that he did not want her to go, but she told him that she had to. However, Strange was given a kiss on the cheek before she walked away. Strange then reclaimed the \nCloak of Levitation\n, which wiped a tear from his eye with the collar, much to his minor annoyance.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange convinces \nKarl Mordo\n to fight back\n \n \nReturning into \nKamar-Taj\n which had been left in utter ruins due to the \nprevious attack\n, Strange found \nKarl Mordo\n who was now considering everything he had learned about the Ancient One's lies. Although Strange passed it off as her being complicated, Mordo argued that she was directly responsible for \nKaecilius\n and all the \nZealots\n turning against them. Despite all this, however, Strange convinced Mordo to continue fighting against \nDormammu\n while they still could.\n[\n1\n]\nDefending the Hong Kong Sanctum\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and Mordo see the \nZealots\n' victory\n \n \n\"I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.\"\n\"Well, don't stop now.\"\n\"When the \nSanctum\n is restored, \nthey\n will attack again. We have to defend it.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nWong\n[src]\nStrange and \nKarl Mordo\n headed into \nHong Kong\n, only to discover to their horror that the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n had been defeated by the \nZealots\n and the \nHong Kong Sanctum\n itself had already been destroyed, allowing the \nDark Dimension\n to begin consuming the entire \nEarth\n. The devastated Mordo then told Strange that nothing could be done to stop the Zealots from executing their plans.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange uses the \nEye of Agamotto\n's power\n \n \nUnwilling to allow the Zealots to succeed and the Dark Dimension to destroy the Earth, Strange began opening the \nEye of Agamotto\n in a final effort to defeat the Zealots. Seeing this, \nKaecilius\n ran forward as Strange opened the Eye and harnessed its \nmagic\n. As Kaecilius reached him and tried to kill Strange with a \nSpace-Time Shard\n, Strange completed the spell and froze Kaecilius in place. Strange then began breaking the natural laws of time as he reversed what happened, repairing the destroyed buildings all around the currently burning city.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange battles against a furious \nKaecilius\n \n \nKaecilius refused to allow this, however, and broke himself and his Zealots out of the spell, allowing them to remain at the same time span as Strange and Mordo. As they made their way across the city, Strange and Mordo were ambushed, with Mordo being forced to battle both the \nBrunette\n and the \nBlonde Zealots\n while Strange fought Kaecilius, who desperately attempted to break the new spell while Strange used the changing landscape to his advantage.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange successfully returning \nWong\n to life\n \n \nAs Mordo assisted Strange using the \nStaff of the Living Tribunal\n to trap Kaecilius inside of a building as it was being rebuilt, they then discovered the corpse of \nWong\n, who had died fighting the Zealots. Strange proceeded to use the Eye of Agamotto's magic to return Wong and many other innocent bystanders from the dead, with Wong, who was still armed with the \nWand of Watoomb\n, shocked by what he was seeing but still choosing not to complain.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange's time spell is broken by \nKaecilius\n \n \nAs Strange, Mordo, and Wong prepared to run back to the Hong Kong Sanctum to defend it, they were then interrupted mid-spell, resulting in time being frozen around the fighting. Kaecilius returned and declared that \nDormammu\n's arrival could not be stopped and once again mentioned that the Dark Dimension was beyond time. Hearing this, Strange figured out a way to defeat Dormammu and headed to the Dark Dimension where time was irrelevant.\n[\n1\n]\nMaking a Bargain\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asking to bargain with \nDormammu\n \n \n\"Dormammu! I've come to bargain.\"\n\"You cannot do this forever.\"\n\"Actually, I can. This is how things are now. You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.\"\n\"Then you will spend eternity dying.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nDormammu\n[src]\nUsing the \nCloak of Levitation\n, Strange flew away from the battle and arrived inside the \nDark Dimension\n, where he proceeded to use the \nEye of Agamotto\n to cast another time spell which allowed him to create a time loop. Strange then confronted the monstrous \nDormammu\n declaring that he had come to bargain. However, Dormammu simply ignored Strange's offer and swiftly destroyed him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is repeatedly killed by \nDormammu\n \n \nSuddenly, Strange appeared again repeating the exact same words as before. Slightly confused but undaunted, Dormammu then killed Strange again, only for him to reappear and repeat his challenge yet again. Perplexed by this, Dormammu demanded to know what was happening. Strange explained that he had used the Eye of Agamotto to create an endless time loop, keeping both him and Dormammu trapped repeating the loop forever until he relented and listened to his bargain. Enraged, Dormammu \nkilled\n Strange over and over again but was unable to stop the cycle from repeating itself endlessly.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange makes his bargain with \nDormammu\n \n \nUnlike Strange, Dormammu had no power over time since the Dark Dimension was a place beyond time. Trying to convince him to break the loop, Dormammu noted Strange would spend eternity dying in agony, but Strange insisted it was a price worth paying to protect everyone on \nEarth\n. Eventually, Dormammu became desperate and surrendered, asking what Strange had wanted. Strange demanded he never return to Earth and to take the \nZealots\n with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange witnesses \nKaecilius\n' sudden defeat\n \n \nStrange returned to \nHong Kong\n to complete the time spell, coming back moments before he left as the Zealots overlooked their own victory. As \nKaecilius\n looked around at Strange in horror, he demanded to know what he had done, to which Strange announced he had made a bargain which Kaecilius would not like. Strange then watched as Dormammu turned Kaecilius and his Zealots into \nMindless Ones\n and took them all away into his Dimension to suffer for eternity.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange watches as \nKarl Mordo\n walks away\n \n \nAs Strange noted that Kaecilius should have read the warnings of the spell, \nWong\n burst out laughing before Strange completed his time spell and returned Hong Kong back to normal. Having witnessed Strange and the \nAncient One\n's liberal use of \nmagic\n to break their own rules, \nKarl Mordo\n told Strange that he had made his choice and left the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n, having become disillusioned by their questionable and dangerous use of their own magic.\n[\n1\n]\nNew Protector\n[\n]\nGuarding the Sanctum\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange returns the \nEye of Agamotto\n \n \n\"Wise choice. You'll wear the \nEye of Agamotto\n in time. Until then, best not to walk the streets with an \nInfinity Stone\n.\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"You have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn.\"\n\nWong\n to Doctor Strange\n[src]\nRealizing he was not yet worthy of wielding the \nEye of Agamotto\n due to his potential to change the fabric of both reality and time, Strange decided it would be best to return the relic inside \nKamar-Taj\n. Joining Strange there, \nWong\n agreed with his choice, claiming to overuse an \nInfinity Stone\n was dangerous. Strange made it clear he did not know about the Stones; a fact that did not surprise Wong.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange arrives in the \nNew York Sanctum\n \n \nWong had gone on to note that the \nNew York Sanctum\n needed a new protector, due to \nDaniel Drumm\n being murdered by \nKaecilius\n. Strange accepted the offer and placed the \nCloak of Levitation\n back over his own shoulders before following Wong through a \nportal\n towards the Sanctum. Once there, Strange put on the watch \nChristine Palmer\n had given him and then looked out at his new home through the window.\n[\n1\n]\nImmediately following his \nduel\n with \nDormammu\n, Strange created a list of extraterrestrial and inter-dimensional beings who posed a threat to the people of \nEarth\n, such as \nLoki\n. During this time, Strange also learned that \nOdin\n, the former king of \nAsgard\n, was on Earth and made contact with him, with Odin opting to stay on Earth, instead of returning to Asgard.\n[\n16\n]\n Strange attended a full moon party at Kamar-Taj, causing Strange to cast the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n to make all sorcerers forget about the party except himself.\n[\n17\n]\n Strange and Wong started developing a closer relationship, in which Strange would often say things in an attempt to get a rise out of Wong, but Wong would refuse.\n[\n15\n]\nLearning of the Infinity Stones\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor Strange introduces himself to \nThor\n \n \n\"I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother \nLoki\n is one of those beings.\"\n\"A worthy inclusion.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nThor\n[src]\nSeveral months into his time as the \nNew York Sanctum\n's guardian, Strange had a conversation with \nWong\n regarding the \nInfinity Stones\n and their history across the \nNine Realms\n. Wong also explained that his reason for telling him this was that \nThor\n had seemingly returned to \nEarth\n and brought \nLoki\n with him for unknown reasons, which could pose a potential threat to the planet.\n[\n8\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange teleports \nThor\n around the Sanctum\n \n \nConsidering the threat that Loki had posed to the Earth when he had used the \nTesseract\n and caused the \nBattle of New York\n, Strange sent Loki through a portal when he arrived in \nNew York City\n and decided to bring Thor into the Sanctum, leaving his business card behind for Thor to find. Upon reaching the Sanctum, Thor, bemused to find Earth had mystical protectors, inadvertently also knocked several ancient artifacts over while he had been exploring the Sanctum.\n[\n16\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asking \nThor\n's motives on returning\n \n \nStrange sat down across from Thor, at first offering him a cup of tea which he changed to an ale upon Thor's request. Strange went on to explain that since becoming one of the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n he had begun to keep a watchlist of many of the dangerous individuals from the \nMultiverse\n, noting that Loki was on that list, which Thor had noted was a worthy inclusion. Strange questioned why Thor had decided to bring Loki back to Earth considering the risk.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n16\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange agreeing to help \nThor\n locate \nOdin\n \n \nThor explained that he and Loki had been looking for \nOdin\n who had vanished ever since Loki had taken his place during their \nconflict\n with the \nDark Elves\n' leader, \nMalekith\n. Strange then offered his help on the condition that they would then return straight to \nAsgard\n as soon as the mission had been completed, which Thor agreed to. Strange noted he had been unable to contact Thor and explained that Odin had requested that he remain in exile without being found.\n[\n16\n]\nLocating Odin\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange ensuring that \nThor\n's mission is safe\n \n \n\"So, if I were to tell you where \nOdin\n was, all parties concerned would promptly return to \nAsgard\n?\"\n\"Promptly.\"\n\"Great, then I'll help you.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nThor\n[src]\nStrange explained that \nOdin\n was currently still hiding out in his exile within \nNorway\n as Strange used his powers to teleport himself and \nThor\n around the \nNew York Sanctum\n while he confirmed that he did not have to modify his \nmagic\n in order for it to work for \nAsgardians\n, with Thor getting also increasingly annoyed about being teleported around the building so much and spilling his ale as a result.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange creates a portal to \nOdin\n's location\n \n \nStrange then requested a strand of Thor's hair, ignoring his protests and taking it regardless before using it to create the portal to Norway. Before he left, Strange reminded Thor to collect \nMjlnir\n, which had been disguised as an umbrella while he was on \nEarth\n, with the pair overhearing the umbrella smashing through several items upstairs before it returned to Thor's hand, which Thor apologized for. Just as he prepared to leave, Thor then requested \nLoki\n's return.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange says his goodbyes to \nThor\n and \nLoki\n \n \nOnce Strange released Loki, he attempted to attack Strange in his fury for allowing him to fall through the portal for thirty minutes, but Strange decided he was done with the Asgardians, unceremoniously throwing Thor and Loki into the portal to Odin's location.\n[\n16\n]\n Strange then went back to his previous conversation with \nWong\n in order to learn about the final \nInfinity Stone\n; the \nSoul Stone\n, which Wong had revealed had the potential to be the most dangerous of all.\n[\n8\n]\nUnauthorized Biography\n[\n]\n\"You hole yourself up here for days on end-\"\n\"Fifteen minutes. Seventeen now, actually.\"\n\"Fine. Minutes on end, telling me that it falls upon you to update the annals of magical history or something like that, and I can't help but think what you're really doing is writing some kind of unauthorized biography about me.\"\nStephen Strange and \nWong\n[src]\nThat fall, Strange started to experience a cloudy mind, although he did not think anything of it. He approached \nWong\n, who was in a room attempting to write. Strange suggested that Wong needed a break, giving him tea, which Wong was suspicious of. Strange admitted that he wanted to know what Wong was writing, since the way Wong worded it made it appear as though Wong were writing about Strange. Wong laughed and explained that, since Strange joined the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n, a lot had happened that needed to be documented so that future Masters could learn from it. Strange eventually left the \nNew York Sanctum\n and went into \nNew York City\n to clear his head. However, his cloudy mind turned into headaches that got worse and came with visions, so he returned to the Sanctum.\n[\n15\n]\nDefeating Kalkartho\n[\n]\n\"See? Vacation home. The only thing in this \ndimension\n are those weird energy clouds. No living things. Here, \nKalkartho\n will have a never-ending supply of energy.\"\nStephen Strange to \nWong\n[src]\nHe came back hours later with a suitcase and tried to leverage the information about where he was for information about \nWong\n's writing, but Wong convinced Strange to tell him in exchange for Wong thinking about telling Strange about the writing. He told Wong about his headaches, so Wong decided to consult the texts at \nKamar-Taj\n. Strange asked Wong to go while he stayed behind to meditate. Strange used an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to offer Wong various fruits, all of which Wong turned down. Strange then used the \nRotunda of Gateways\n to leave and meditate on a mountain. He had another vision of a tentacled creature going to \nEarth\n along with the name \nKalkartho\n. When he returned hours later, Wong told Strange that he did not find anything and got Strange to admit that he knew he would not. Strange explained that he did not know what would happen to him while meditating and that he did not want Wong in Kamar-Taj if something followed him through the Rotunda. Wong asked what Strange learned, so Strange explained his vision to him.\nThey began searching the library for hope of stopping the Kalkartho. Strange searched \nThe Book of the Five\n and found the \nBonds of Baelzar\n, which Wong voiced his disagreement with Strange's idea to use them, though he hesitantly agreed to. Strange memorized the incantation and put the book back, and the two went to \nMendoza\n, \nArgentina\n. The two sat as Strange opened a mist which created a pocket that allowed them to see into the \nMagenta Dimension\n, from which the Bonds of Baelzar drew their energy.\nThey returned to the \nNew York Sanctum\n and Strange explained his plan to banish the Kalkartho by intercepting it in the \nAstral Dimension\n, but the Kalkartho suddenly attacked and rendered Strange unconscious, nearly killing him, but Wong resuscitated him. Wong tried to convince Strange to stay out of it, but the sorcerer refused, and they decided to end it. They projected themselves into the Astral Dimension and went to the \nmoon\n, releasing energy from the Magenta Dimension. Kalkartho suddenly appeared in front of Strange and Wong, and Wong started ducking attacks while Strange worked. However, Wong passed out.\nStrange brought himself and Wong back to their bodies and baited the creature to the Sanctum as Wong woke up. Kalkartho appeared in the Sanctum in the physical world, so Strange yelled for Wong to activate the Bonds of Baelzar as he avoided the attacks. As the mist faded and took Kalkartho into the Magenta Dimension, Strange and Wong went with it. They watched it consume an energy cloud, and Strange explained that the clouds were the only thing in the dimension and that Kalkartho would have a never-ending supply of energy. The two then returned to \nEarth\n.\nWong returned to his writing and Strange tried spying on him using a portal while eating pizza. Wong offered to tell Strange what he was writing in exchange for a slice, but Strange instead said that they would always be ready to fight and closed the portal.\n[\n15\n]\nInfinity War\n[\n]\nLearning of Thanos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange witnesses \nBruce Banner\n's return\n \n \n\"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.

However, Wong then revealed that he did not have any actual American money, annoying Strange, who told him he'd buy a tuna sandwich instead.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks \nTony Stark\n for help\n \n \nAt that moment, \nBruce Banner\n crashed inside the place, having been brought there by \nHeimdall\n's \nbridge\n. Strange then formed up with his sorcerer getup only to figure out it was Banner, telling him that \nThanos\n was coming, much to Strange curiosity.\n[\n2\n]\n At Banner's urging,\n[\n18\n]\n he and Strange went to find \nTony Stark\n who was with \nPepper Potts\n at Central Park, telling him to come with the group and congratulate them on their proposal.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange explaining the \nTime Stone\n's power\n \n \nOnce \nTony Stark\n arrived with Strange to the \nNew York Sanctum\n, Wong showed Stark about the \nInfinity Stones\n, where they came from and how many there were. As he named them all one by one, Strange revealed the \nTime Stone\n from the \nEye of Agamotto\n. Once Stark asked about Thanos, Strange told him if he could get all six stones, he would destroy half of all life that should be hitherto undreamed of. Having to understand that the universe was at stake, Strange listened to Stark about his use of language, to which he grew irritated with Stark from touching the \nCauldron of the Cosmos\n and letting the \nCloak of Levitation\n hit his hand.\n[\n2\n]\nKidnapped by the Black Order\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange hears the commotion from outside\n \n \n\"Stonekeeper, does this \nchattering animal\n speak for you?\"\n\"Certainly not, I speak for myself.

Banner told Stark to call \nSteve Rogers\n for help. Before Stark would make the call, they were interrupted by the sound of agitation in the streets and debris flying through the air. Leaving the \nNew York Sanctum\n to investigate, the four found people fleeing and screaming in panic, as a \nQ-Ship\n, sent by \nThanos\n, had arrived, devastating the surrounding city with powerful winds.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nIron Man\n battle the \nBlack Order\n \n \nStrange and the group confronted the ship, where Strange cast the \nWinds of Watoomb\n spell to neutralize the powerful winds created by the Q-Ship. Once the craft drew out \nEbony Maw\n and \nCull Obsidian\n, who descended from the ship in a tractor beam, Maw demanded the \nTime Stone\n, which was kept in the \nEye of Agamotto\n, only to be rudely rebuffed and commanded to leave by both Strange and Stark. Frustrated, Maw commanded Obsidian to attack and retrieve the Stone, while Banner unsuccessfully attempted to release Hulk, Stark donned his \nMark L armor\n and blasted Obsidian away.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange redirecting \nEbony Maw\n's attack\n \n \nUsing his \nSling Ring\n to send Banner to safety, Strange was then told by Iron Man to flee with the Time Stone, but he refused. Strange and \nWong\n managed to redirect the attack with their Sling Rings, injuring Maw. Infuriated, Maw incapacitated Wong by bursting a nearby fire hydrant. Strange attempted to restrain Maw with an \nEldritch Whip\n, only for the latter to tackle Strange, telekinetically trapping him in the side of a nearby building.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being overpowered by \nEbony Maw\n \n \nStrange was then sealed by bricks from Maw, which he attempted to remove the Time Stone. Breaking free, Strange attempted to use the Stone against Maw but was quickly restrained again by cables. Before Maw could kill Strange, he warned that his death would not remove the seal, causing Maw to choke him unconscious instead, choosing to bring him back to the Q-Ship alive. However, the \nCloak of Levitation\n managed to loosen the restraints with the unconscious Strange, with an enraged Maw in hot pursuit.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being incapacitated by \nEbony Maw\n \n \nStrange passed by in the park, where Iron Man tasked \nSpider-Man\n with rescuing the unconscious Strange as he held off Obsidian. Maw noticed Spider-Man was chasing him and tried to get away. Despite Maw's efforts, Spider-Man managed to grab Strange, only for the both of them, as well as the Cloak, to be caught in the Q-ship's tractor beam. Maw boarded the Q-Ship with Strange and held him off captive until he would give up the stone.\n[\n2\n]\nTortured by Ebony Maw\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange waking up from his coma\n \n \n\"You have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the \nkid\n or the \nTime Stone\n...

Noticing that Strange is awake, Maw approached him, preparing to begin the torture.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is slowly tortured by \nEbony Maw\n \n \nAs the horrendous torture began, Strange was informed by Maw that he would be judged harshly by Thanos for bringing him alive, and so requires Strange to remove the magical seal protecting the Time Stone in the \nEye of Agamotto\n, to allow Maw to retrieve it. With this remark, Maw began to telekinetically stab the microsurgery needles one by one into Strange's body, each inducing terrible pain while commanding that Strange release the Stone, to no avail.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is further tortured by \nEbony Maw\n \n \nStrange continued to get tortured by Maw, who, while under immense pain and duress, remained unyielding to Maw's demands. Before Maw could continue, he was interrupted by the sudden appearance of \nIron Man\n. Maw threatened to kill Strange, but Iron Man fired a missile into the wall of the Q-Ship. The hull was breached, instantly sucking Maw into the vacuum of space. Strange was inadvertently caught in the vacuum, and the Cloak of Levitation attempted to rescue him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange introducing himself to \nSpider-Man\n \n \nLeaping in, \nSpider-Man\n managed to grab Strange. Stark noted that the Q-Ship was on an automated course bound for an \nunknown location\n. Strange insisted that Stark commandeer the Q-Ship to return them and the Time Stone to \nEarth\n, although Stark was reluctant. Instead, he suggested continuing on their current course to Thanos, proposing they ambush him on his territory, where he would not be expecting an attack, and to keep his attention away from Earth.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nTony Stark\n argue at each other\n \n \nAlthough initially at odds, Strange reluctantly agreed with Stark's plan, after he told of his history over the years about Thanos' manipulative discourse.

Sitting down on a faraway hill alone, Strange saw \nThanos\n and informed him that he had been brought face-to-face with a \nMaster of the Mystic Arts\n. Thanos ignored the threat, simply asking Strange where he believed \nEbony Maw\n had brought him. Strange guessed that \nTitan\n was his former home. Nodding wistfully in affirmation to Strange, Thanos stopped and began to reminisce. Thanos would use the \nReality Stone\n to craft an illusion of Titan's former beauty to Strange.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange prepares to battle against \nThanos\n \n \nStrange hailed Thanos as a prophet, but Thanos retorted, claiming himself to be a survivor. Strange continued to condemn the Mad Titan's motivations as for \nmass murdering\n trillions. Thanos explained to Strange that with all six \nInfinity Stones\n, a single snap of his finger would only cause a merciful cessation of half of the universe's existence. Strange stood and questioned Thanos about once he achieved his goal. Thanos desired to simply rest while watching the sunrise on a grateful Universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange striking at \nThanos\n with his sword\n \n \nThreatening Thanos, Strange entered a combat stance and summoned a pair of \nTao Mandalas\n, warning Thanos that their will would be equal to his. Realizing that Strange was not alone, Thanos was temporarily ambushed, only to begin attacking. Strange conjured a sword and engaged the half-blinded Thanos in brief close combat alongside \nDrax the Destroyer\n. However, Thanos kicked Strange in which he blocked it with a \nTao Mandala\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange helps \nStar-Lord\n's traversal\n \n \nStrange conjured platforms of energy for \nStar-Lord\n to jump and conjured a \nportal\n for Star-Lord to escape. Strange told the \nCloak of Levitation\n to not allow Thanos to close his fist, and the Cloak wrapped around the Infinity Gauntlet to prevent Thanos from activating the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n. Using his \nSling Ring\n, Strange summoned \nSpider-Man\n to attack Thanos, leaping through conjured portals to repeatedly attack Thanos from all sides and preventing him from removing the Cloak.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attempts to apprehend \nThanos\n \n \nHowever, once Thanos managed to grab Spider-Man, he threw the web-slinger towards Strange, knocking them both to the ground. Recovered from his harmful attack, Strange quickly cast the \nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\n on Thanos, restraining the Gauntlet. Until \nIron Man\n swooped in, taking Strange's place to hold the Gauntlet. Strange used his \nSling Ring\n to open a portal and drop \nMantis\n on Thanos' head, before casting the Bands again to restrain his right arm.\n[\n2\n]\nShowdown with Thanos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attacks \nThanos\n on floating cliffs\n \n \n\"You're full of tricks, wizard. Yet you never once used your \ngreatest weapon\n. A \nfake\n.\"\n\nThanos\n to Doctor Strange\n[src]\nFollowing the failed attempt of getting the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n off, Strange personally confronted \nThanos\n in a ferocious duel, with Strange launching the first strike, firing the \nBolts of Balthakk\n towards Thanos. Leaping into the air, Thanos retaliated with a blast of energy from the \nPower Stone\n. Strange countered with a barrier of the \nMirror Dimension\n to absorb the beam, before pushing it toward Thanos to trap him. Thanos destroyed the mirror barrier with the Power Stone before throwing the remnants back at Strange in the form of a black hole with the \nSpace Stone\n. Thinking quickly, Strange cast a spell to transmute the singularity into a swarm of blue butterflies, briefly confusing Thanos.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange casts the \nImages of Ikonn\n \n \nRaising into the air with the \nCloak of Levitation\n, Strange then cast the \nImages of Ikonn\n, conjuring versions of himself to restrain Thanos with hundreds of \nEldritch Whips\n. However, Thanos immediately regained the upper hand, activating the \nSoul\n and Power Stones to instantly destroy the false images and briefly sunder Strange's \nastral form\n from his body. With his opponent staggered, Thanos activated the Space and \nReality Stones\n, pulling Strange to his hand before he could react, winning the duel.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being swiftly subdued by \nThanos\n \n \nOnce he was subdued, Strange was within Thanos' grasp and tried to pull himself away. Admitting that while he was impressed by Strange's mastery over \nmagic\n, Thanos deduced that, as the sorcerer had never once attempted to use the \nTime Stone\n to his advantage, the \nEye of Agamotto\n that was being worn was a fake. Confirming his suspicions, Thanos took and crushed the fake Eye of Agamotto, revealing it to be empty, before throwing Strange away.\n[\n2\n]\nThanos' Victory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor Strange gives up the \nTime Stone\n \n \n\"Tony. There was no other way.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nTony Stark\n[src]\nBefore \nThanos\n could kill \nIron Man\n, Strange intervened and offered the \nTime Stone\n in exchange for Stark's life,\n[\n2\n]\n since his future vision revealed to him that Stark needed to live to convert \nHank Pym\n's \nQuantum Tunnel\n into a time machine for the \nTime Heist\n and sacrifice himself at the \nBattle of Earth\n to defeat Thanos.\n[\n9\n]\n Thanos agreed after warning Strange not to double-cross him. Despite Stark's pleas to not give in, Strange revealed the Time Stone, having disguised it as a star in \nTitan\n's sky, and surrendered it to Thanos. After the battle, Stark would ask Strange why he would give up the Stone. Strange could only inform Stark that they were now in the \"endgame.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is turned into dust by \nThanos\n \n \nWhen Thanos collected the last remaining stone, the \nMind Stone\n, from \nVision\n in \nWakanda\n, he snapped his fingers, removing half of sapient life in the universe from existence. After watching \nMantis\n, \nDrax\n, and \nStar-Lord\n vanish before their eyes, Strange, gradually disintegrating into dust himself, assured a visibly-shaken Stark that there was no other way before disappearing.\n[\n2\n]\n With no Sorcerer Supreme since \n2017\n, the position had been left vacant with Strange as a candidate\n[\n21\n]\n, but with Strange dead, the title of Sorcerer Supreme was given to \nWong\n.\n[\n17\n]\nBattle of Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange returns to \nEarth\n through his \nportal\n \n \n\"Hey, you said one out of fourteen million, we win.

Knowing what had transpired during the five years due to looking into the future with the \nEye of Agamotto\n, Strange enlisted the assistance of the newly resurrected \nSpider-Man\n and the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, who were also on Titan with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks \nWong\n about all of the heroes\n \n \nHe then opened a \nportal\n from Titan to \nEarth\n and arrived at the destroyed \nAvengers Compound\n to prepare for the \nmassive battle\n against an \nalternate Thanos\n. He observed as \nWong\n and the other \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n portaled in multiple allies across the universe in order for them to assist the surviving \nAvengers\n in the fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange prepares for battle against \nThanos\n \n \nAfter seeing Wong in person, he inquired if they were able to summon everyone, to which Wong exasperatedly asked Strange if he wanted more. Strange then stood alongside the epic line of assembled heroes as \nCaptain America\n led the charge against Thanos and his army. Strange then charged towards Thanos' army, using the \nCloak of Levitation\n to fly into the air and into battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange getting approached by \nIron Man\n \n \nAfter taking down a group of aliens with magic into another dimension, Strange was approached by \nIron Man\n, who questioned if this was the one out of fourteen million futures in which they would win. Strange replied that if he told him what happens, it would not happen. Stark then told Strange that he had better be right.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange stops the area from being flooded\n \n \nWhen Thanos ordered an airstrike to halt \nWanda Maximoff\n's attacks, it destroyed the foundations of the nearby lake. When \nPepper Potts\n called this to attention, Strange conjured the \nWinds of Watoomb\n to hold back the water from reaching the battlefield. Strange continued to hold back the water after Thanos had destroyed \nLuis\n' \nvan\n with his \nsword\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange giving \nIron Man\n the final signal\n \n \nAfter seeing \nCaptain Marvel\n get knocked out of the fight by Thanos, Strange signaled to Stark that this was the one outcome he foresaw where they won. This ultimately led to Stark sacrificing himself by swiping the \nInfinity Stones\n and using them to wipe out Thanos and his army.\n[\n9\n]\n All the heroes then gathered around the fallen hero, and following \nClint Barton\n, everyone, including Strange, knelt before him out of respect.\n[\n22\n]\nTony Stark's Funeral\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attends the funeral for \nTony Stark\n \n \nA week later, Strange and \nWong\n attended \nTony Stark\n's funeral at the \nStark Eco-Compound\n. Strange and Wong stood alongside all the heroes who they previously fought with, as Stark's \nArc Reactor\n was sent adrift on the lake.\n[\n9\n]\n Afterwards, Strange returned to live at the \nNew York Sanctum\n.\n[\n17\n]\n\"Friendship\" with Scott Lang\n[\n]\n\"If you always hoped \nAnt-Man\n would write a \nbook\n, you're in luck. I confess I did notbut I enjoyed it all the same.\"\nStephen Strange\n[src]\nFollowing the \nBattle of Earth\n, \nScott Lang\n struck up a friendship with various \nAvengers\n, as well as other heroes. Strange was one of those heroes, as he attempted to befriend Strange; however, Strange did not reciprocate the attempts at friendship, dismissing Lang.\nAfter Lang was later nominated to write a book about the events surrounding the \nBlip\n and \nThanos\n' defeat, titled \nLook Out for the Little Guy!\n, Strange was given a copy of the book to read and enjoyed it. Strange's review was then featured on the back of the book alongside \nBruce Banner\n's, \nCaptain America\n's, \nHawkeye\n's and \nChristine Everhart\n's. The review said that although he was not hoping for Lang to write a book, he still enjoyed reading it.\n[\n23\n]\nMultiversal Crisis\n[\n]\nHelping Peter Parker\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nWong\n meet with \nPeter Parker\n \n \n\"You know, after everything we've been through together, somehow I always forget... You're just a kid. Look, part of the problem, it's not \nMysterio\n. It's you. Trying to live two different lives.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nPeter Parker\n[src]\nIn \n2024\n, Strange witnessed a blizzard in \nSiberia\n come through the \nRotunda of Gateways\n into the \nNew York Sanctum\n. That November, he was visited by \nPeter Parker\n, who was surprised to learn that Strange was not Sorcerer Supreme and that \nWong\n had been given the title. Strange asked what the reason for the visit was and insisted that Parker no longer refer to him as \"sir\" due to their shared experiences. Parker brought up that \nMysterio\n revealing his identity to the world ruined his life, and asked if Strange could go back in time and stop it from happening.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange decides to help out \nPeter Parker\n \n \nAs Parker pled his case, Strange informed him that he was no longer in possession of the \nTime Stone\n and voiced his concerns that the recent \nTime Heist\n affected the space-time continuum, but was given the idea to cast a \nspell\n that would make everyone forget Parker was Spider-Man. Wong objected Strange's idea, as it traveled the borders of known and unknown realities, but Strange revealed he had used the spell for less important matters, such as a party at \nKamar-Taj\n. Strange attempted to convince Wong, who decided to let it happen, only if he were to be left out of the entire situation, and he departed through an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to Kamar-Taj.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange starts casting the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n \n \nStrange brought Parker down to the Sanctum's lower level to a room that had walls that were thousands of years old and were filled with cosmic energy currents. As he began to cast the spell, he said a farewell to Parker, as he would soon forget who he was. Parker questioned what Strange meant, who revealed that the spell would make everyone in the world forget, and that it would be dangerous to change while casting the spell. However, Strange decided to allow Parker's \ngirlfriend\n to remember, but Parker continued to add a \nfew\n \nmore\n \npeople\n as he wanted not to forget him, even after Strange insisted on not altering it further, which caused him to start losing control of the spell.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange's \nspell\n is changed by \nPeter Parker\n \n \nDue to the interference, the spell erupted around them, creating a fissure in the \nMultiverse\n, with Parker changing again it so that only people that knew he was Spider-Man before the reveal would know, so Strange quickly shut it down before chaos ensued and stored it inside the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange chastises \nPeter Parker\n's tampering\n \n \nAnnoyed that his spell was changed, Strange angrily told Parker that it did not work, and explained that the problem was him trying to live two different lives. When Strange learnt that Parker tried to get him to brainwash the world before speaking to the people at \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n, he promptly removed him from the Sanctum.\n[\n17\n]\nCapturing Multiversal Visitors\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange explains the \nMultiverse\n has opened\n \n \n\"I thought you stopped the \nspell\n?\"\n\"No, I contained it, but it would appear that a few of them squeaked through. After you left, I detected an otherworldly presence. I pursued it into the sewers, where I found that \nslimy, green, son of a gun\n.\"\n\nPeter Parker\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nSoon after, Strange detected an otherworldly presence, and went to investigate, finding \nLizard\n in the sewers, so he put him in a cell under the Sanctum, realizing that the spell had caused people from the \nMultiverse\n that knew Parker was Spider-Man to be brought over to their universe. Strange used his \nSling Ring\n to bring back Parker, who had encountered another one, \nDoctor Octopus\n, who Strange put in a cell also. He explained to Parker how he was only able to contain the spell, which is why a few people have managed to cross the Multiverse.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange gives \nPeter Parker\n a \nmagic\n device\n \n \nSeeking to remedy the situation, Strange then tasked Parker with locating the rest and bringing them back to the Sanctum while he figured out a way to return them to their respective universes before they destroyed the fabric of reality. Strange upgraded Parker's \nSpider-Man Suit\n and \nWeb-Shooters\n with a \nmagic\n device so that he could transport any universe-displaced people directly to a cell in the Sanctum. Parker then told Strange that he would still help in finding the people, so Strange went to find Parker's friends.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is talked back to by \nMichelle Jones\n \n \nStrange found \nMichelle Jones\n and \nNed Leeds\n, and brought them to the Sanctum, where they asked about how the people got to their universe, so Strange explained how Parker's attempts to get them all into college led to the spell that went wrong. Wanting to get the problem over with, Strange reminded them to get to work and start looking for any more trespassers from the Multiverse. However, after Jones called him out for being the one that messed up the spell, Strange saw her point and told them to get to work, allowing them to use the undercroft.\n[\n17\n]\nConflict with Spider-Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange arrives to cast the \nspell\n again\n \n \n\"Parker, don't you realize that in the \nMultiverse\n, there are an infinite number of people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man. And if that \nspell\n gets loose, they're all coming here.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nLater, Strange returned to the Sanctum's undercroft and saw that \nSandman\n and \nElectro\n had been added into the cells. He then spotted \nNorman Osborn\n and transported him into a cell. He revealed that he had used the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n, an ancient relic to trap the corrupted spell, and only needed to complete the ritual to reverse what had been done. Parker told Strange not to go through with the plan, as it meant sending them to their deaths, but Strange was adamant on upholding their fates, so he began the ritual to send them back.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange attempting to stop \nPeter Parker\n \n \nBefore Strange could complete the ritual, Parker snatched the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n away from him and used his upgraded gauntlet to put Strange in a cell with Sandman, as he ran away. Strange was able to walk out of the cell, and followed Parker outside the Sanctum, using an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to prevent him from leaving. Strange removed the gauntlet from Parker and pushed his \nastral form\n out of his body but was unable to take back the Macchina due to Parker's \nSpider-Sense\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange manipulating the \nMirror Dimension\n \n \nParker managed to return to his physical body, and began swinging away, so Strange sent the \nCloak of Levitation\n after him, allowing Strange to open the \nMirror Dimension\n and put Parker in it. Being in complete control in the Mirror Dimension, Strange manipulated the environment as he pursued Spider-Man, leading to them facing off on top of a train in \nCentral Park\n. Strange told Spider-Man that the spell could not get loose as an infinite number of people would cross into their universe, but Spider-Man was determined to change the fate before sending them back.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange trying to reason with \nSpider-Man\n \n \nStrange opened a portal above and below Spider-Man, causing him to fall endlessly with the Cloak grabbing the Macchina. Parker collided the two portals into each other, making the Mirror Dimension alter around them and making them appear by the \nGrand Canyon\n in \nArizona\n. The Macchina fell, so Strange flew after it. Strange retrieved the Macchina and opened a portal out of the Mirror Dimension.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is trapped in the \nMirror Dimension\n \n \nSpider-Man used his knowledge of geometry to \nweb\n Strange up. As he boasted that math was cooler than magic, Spider-Man took the Macchina and then used his webs to take Strange's \nSling Ring\n. He then went through the portal, leaving Strange tied up in the Mirror Dimension.\n[\n17\n]\nBattle at Liberty Island\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange arrives on the \nStatue of Liberty\n \n \n\"Everyone who knows and loves you, we... we'd have no memory of you. It would be as though you never existed.\"\n\"I know. Do it.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nAfter being stuck in the \nGrand Canyon\n within the \nMirror Dimension\n for twelve hours, Strange managed to escape and come through an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n that was inadvertently opened up by \nNed Leeds\n to the \nStatue of Liberty\n. Being greeted by Leeds and \nMichelle Jones\n, Strange asked them where Parker was then reclaimed his \nSling Ring\n and the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n. \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns that \nNed Leeds\n has magic\n \n \nHowever, before he could do anything else, Strange was informed by Leeds and Jones that Parker's plan to cure the universe-displaced people was working, as they witnessed \nLizard\n turning back into a human. Seeing this, Strange realized that Parker was right about second chances and was right about him not having a heart before. Strange then asked Leeds if he was the one who opened the portal as he replied that he did. Hearing this, Strange was impressed by Leeds as he nodded his head in approval then left to go to the top of the Statue of Liberty.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange witnesses the \nMultiverse\n breaking\n \n \nStrange went to confront Parker, who introduced him to his \ntwo\n \ncounterparts\n from other universes, and reminded him that they had to send everyone back. But at that moment, \nGreen Goblin\n attacked them with his \nRazor Bats\n, with Octavius narrowly saving Strange and snatched the Macchina, so Strange used an \nEldritch Whip\n to get it back, only to find a \nPumpkin Bomb\n had been placed inside of it. With the Macchina destroyed, the unstable spell became loose, and despite Strange's efforts to contain it again, he could not, and the \nMultiverse\n started to crack open. Strange used his magic to close the cracks, but the spell could not be stopped.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange has everyone forget \nPeter Parker\n \n \nParker suggested to cast the spell again how it was meant to be done, but Strange stated that it was too late, as infinite amounts of people from the Multiverse were coming through because of him. Parker then told Strange to cast a new spell to make everyone forget who he was. Strange became slightly emotional and was reluctant however, warning Parker of the severity of the spell, but he accepted it, so Strange told him to say his goodbyes and began casting the spell, but not before they both bade farewell to one another themselves. The spell worked and the universe-displaced were sent back to their universes, along with the infinite number of people, and everyone in his universe forgot Parker's existence, including Strange himself.\n[\n17\n]\nDreams\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange wakes up from a \nmultiversal\n vision\n \n \n\"Last night, you were in my dream.\"\n\"That wasn't a dream.

The creature ended up killing the alternate version of himself and tried to capture the girl, but she opened up a star-shaped portal that caused her and the deceased Strange to fall through. Strange suddenly woke up breathing hard in his bed at the \nNew York Sanctum\n. After looking around to calm himself, he grabbed his wrist watch.\n[\n3\n]\nChristine Palmer's Wedding\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange getting dressed for the wedding\n \n \n\"It was never gonna work out between us.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because, Stephen... You have to be the one holding the knife. And I always respected you for it, but I couldn't love you for it.\"\n\nChristine Palmer\n and Stephen Strange\n[src]\nStrange then got dressed before a mirror, but when he attempted to use his hands to tie his tie, he short cuffed it and used his \nMagic\n to do so. He put his \nCloak of Levitation\n inside his suit front pocket and then left the Sanctum and arrived at a nearby church, where he had been invited to attend \nChristine Palmer\n's wedding.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is questioned by \nNicodemus West\n \n \nStrange then took his seat in a pew and was pleasantly surprised when \nNicodemus West\n came in and sat beside him. West told Strange he hadn't seen him in awhile, in which Strange remarked that he had \ndisappeared\n for five years. West acknowledged that and remarked that he too had been a victim of the \nBlip\n. He then asked Strange if he was right with his actions in the \nInfinity War\n in that there was only one way to defeat \nThanos\n. \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange during \nChristine Palmer\n's wedding\n \n \nStrange reassured him of this, stating there was only one way. West told him that ever since he had been restored to life he had been wondering if there was any other way as to have avoided the \nSnap\n. He told Strange that he had lost his two pet \ncats\n and brother in the time he was gone. Strange expressed his condolences and understood how emotional the event had been. Strange then saw Palmer walk inside as the wedding began. As flower girls threw up flowers as she entered, Strange held his composure, albeit was emotional upon seeing her get married to someone else.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is asked by \nPalmer\n if he is happy\n \n \nAfter the ceremony, Strange was invited to the reception. While there, he encountered Palmer at the bar, and he used magic to fill her glass with wine. He then congratulated her on her wedding, and she told him that her \nhusband\n was a fan of his. Strange told Palmer that he wished things could have been different, but he had to make sacrifices. Palmer responded that it would never have worked out with them due to his personality. Strange claimed that he was glad she was happy, and when Palmer asked if he was happy, Strange told her he was, although not as happy as he wanted to be. She then excused herself to tend to her guests.\n[\n3\n]\nBattle Against Gargantos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange hears \nsomething\n outside\n \n \n\"Look, I left a very nice wedding to save a smartass kid from getting eaten by an \noctopus\n.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nAmerica Chavez\n[src]\nStrange sipped his glass only to hear a car crash outside and people screaming. As guests rushed to the balcony to see what was going on, Strange followed. Upon seeing that there was chaos in the streets, Strange handed his glass to the bartender and took the \nCloak of Levitation\n out of his suit pocket and leaped off the balcony, changing into his sorcerer's suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange puts up \nmagic shields\n \n \nStrange pursued where the chaos was coming from, witnessing a woman nearly get knocked over. He put up protective shields and used his \nmagic\n to conjure giant hands to help him try and stop the invisible creature.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange sees the \ngirl\n from his dream\n \n \nStrange descended onto the street and watched as a \ngirl\n hopped onto a bus. After seeing that the girl was the same person from his dream, he became confused. When the bus was lifted off the ground, Strange became more confused but then used his magic to release the invisibility surrounding it and exposed \nGargantos\n, a one-eyed tentacled inter-dimensional creature.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange faces off against \nGargantos\n \n \nStrange used his magic to slice off one of Gargantos' tentacles in order for him to release the bus. As the girl fell out of the bus, the Cloak went and saved her, bringing her back to Strange. Strange turned to talk to her, but she told him to look out as the bus was thrown back at him. \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange uses his \nmagic\n to slice the bus\n \n \nStrange used his powers to slice the bus in half and keep it from hitting them. He then turned around and asked the girl who she was before getting swatted aside by Gargantos, who knocked him into \nJonas & James\n where he was knocked unconscious.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange rejoins the fight against \nGargantos\n \n \nWhen Strange regained consciousness, he found that his Cloak was missing. He then hopped onto a taxi and observed what was happening. He saw \nWong\n, who had arrived, but was held within Gargantos' grasp. Strange conjured an ax and threw it at the tentacle, releasing Wong. Strange told him he was welcome, while Wong stated that it was custom to bow before the Sorcerer Supreme, and Strange said he was fully aware of the customs.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nWong\n working together\n \n \nStrange and Wong then used \nEldritch Whips\n to grab onto Gargantos, who was still chasing the girl. The girl had been taken onto a high rise building and Gargantos was scaling the building to get to her. Strange used his magic to knock away its tentacle as it tried to grab the girl. However, this did not work, and Gargantos knocked aside Wong and grabbed Strange.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange successfully kills \nGargantos\n \n \nThe Cloak arrived and covered Gargantos' eye as Strange used the giant hands to lift up a nearby lamppost. The Cloak removed itself just as Strange forced the lamppost into Gargantos' eyeball. He then used the giant hand to pull the lamppost out taking the whole eyeball with it. Strange was released and the now-dead Gargantos fell to the street below.\n[\n3\n]\nMeeting the Multiversal Traveler\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange demands answers from the \ngirl\n \n \n\"How much experience do you \nguys\n have with the \nMultiverse\n?\"\n\"We have experience of the Multiverse. Most recently, there was an \nincident\n with \nSpider-Man\n.\"\n\nAmerica Chavez\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nAfterwards, Strange and \nWong\n demanded answers from the \ngirl\n. However, she ran away from them and Strange realized she had taken his \nSling Ring\n. Wong then used his Sling Ring to transport them to where she was. Cornered, the girl was forced to speak to them and told them she could travel the \nMultiverse\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns of \nAmerica Chavez\n's powers\n \n \nStrange and Wong decided to take the girl to \nMancini's Pizzeria\n where they could learn more about her. The girl asked them if they had any experience with the Multiverse. Strange told her that they did in an \nevent\n recently with \nSpider-Man\n. The girl asked if Spider-Man looked like a spider and had the powers of a \nspider\n but Strange told her more of a man. The girl asked where his \nwebs\n came out of and Strange stated he had \nWeb-Shooters\n. The girl then commented that the pizza was really good and that her stomach may be different as she was from another universe. Strange then asked her why she was being chased by creatures.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns about the \nBook of Vishanti\n \n \nThe girl then told them about Strange's \nvariant\n and how he had betrayed her, after which Strange stated he was in his dream as well. However, the girl told him it wasn't a dream. She said they were searching for a book of pure magic and Strange deduced it was the \nBook of Vishanti\n, which he stated was not real. Wong told him it was but was unreachable. The girl said she had found it though. Strange then told the girl to prove that what she was saying wasn't a dream.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nWong\n see his \nvariant\n's corpse\n \n \nShe took them to a building's rooftop and showed them Strange's variant's corpse. When asked what should happen to the body as it would break violations, Strange used his magic to lift the body and place it a block of dirt. He then said he had buried worse. Wong asked the girl what her name was, and she introduced herself as \nAmerica Chavez\n. She was invited to \nKamar-Taj\n and Strange then noted that the symbols on \nGargantos\n and the variant weren't of sorcery and were of witchcraft. When Wong asked who could know such a thing, Strange told them he knew of \nsomeone\n who could help.\n[\n3\n]\nMore Multiversal Problems\n[\n]\nMeeting with Wanda Maximoff\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange speaks with \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \n\"Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye, because that's the kind of justification our enemies use.\"\n\"Is it the one you used when you gave \nThanos\n the \nTime Stone\n?\"\n\"That was a \nwar\n, and I did what I had to do.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nScarlet Witch\n[src]\nStrange travelled to \nWanda Maximoff\n's location and found her living in a \ncabin\n. He approached her as she was gardening and asked her if the apples were real, and she told him that they were very real. She assumed that he was there to talk about \nWestview\n, but he told her that he wasn't there to talk about Westview, acknowledging that Maximoff had done the right thing and taken down her \nHex\n as he thought she would. Strange then asked her what she knew of the \nMultiverse\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks \nWanda Maximoff\n for her help\n \n \nThey went walking and she told him that \nVision\n believed it to be real and dangerous. Strange stated that he was right. Strange then told her that a \ngirl\n had arrived and was being chased by \ncreatures\n. He told Maximoff that he needed her help as she was an \nAvenger\n, but she said there were others he could ask. Strange told her that between \nHawkeye\n, \nAnt-Man\n, \nWasp\n, and \nSpider-Man\n, she was the only logical answer. He offered Maximoff to come to \nKamar-Taj\n, but she suggested that he bring \nAmerica Chavez\n to her instead, causing Strange to pause and stop walking.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns \nMaximoff\n has the \nDarkhold\n \n \nBeginning to deduce that Maximoff knew more than she let on, he became disappointed. When Maximoff saw that Strange had figured it out, she told him that the Hex was easy but lying not so much. She then removed the illusion surrounding the field, revealing a barren desolate landscape. Strange then saw Maximoff's Scarlet Witch uniform and watched as she summoned the \nDarkhold\n. He recognised it and pondered what it had done to Maximoff, knowing its corrupting powers. Maximoff told him that it merely revealed the truth that her \ntwo\n \nchildren\n were alive and that she was planning on escaping to an alternate universe to be with them. Strange retorted that she had created her children, and they were not real.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is threatened by \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nHe said that what she was going to do was breaking every law of reality, but she told him that taking Chavez's powers was for the greater good. Strange replied that her reasoning was the same justification for their enemies, but she countered saying that Strange was contradictory, noting how he gave the \nTime Stone\n to \nThanos\n. Strange told her that that was a \nwar\n and he had no choice. She then told him to go back to Kamar-Taj and prepare to hand over Chavez by sundown. As she walked away, he asked her what would happen if they did not, and she told him that they would meet the Scarlet Witch.\n[\n3\n]\nSiege of Kamar-Taj\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange explains \nScarlet Witch\n's mission\n \n \n\"Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices.\"\n\"I blew a hole through the head of the \nman\n I loved. And it meant nothing. Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nScarlet Witch\n[src]\nStrange returned to \nKamar-Taj\n and told \nWong\n, \nAmerica Chavez\n, and other \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n that the \nDarkhold\n has control over \nWanda Maximoff\n and that she was coming for Chavez. Wong explained how powerful the Scarlet Witch was and Strange noted that she had used her mind to take over a whole \ntown\n. Chavez looked at him suspiciously noting that the person he had gone to ask for help was the same person after her. Strange then prepared as Wong ordered Kamar-Taj to become a fortress.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange waits for \nScarlet Witch\n's arrival\n \n \nAfter the students and Masters went out to defend Kamar-Taj, Strange and Wong joined them. They watched as a large dark cloud rolled in, soon covering the atmosphere in darkness. Strange then looked up and saw Maximoff flying within the clouds. As he was about to speak to her, Wong told him to choose his words wisely.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange giving \nScarlet Witch\n a warning\n \n \nStrange then flew up to speak with her as the clouds dissipated. Maximoff told him that all she wanted was them to hand over Chavez. Strange told her they could not do that and when he mentioned sacrifices, Maximoff became angry. She stated that she had sacrificed everything, mentioning how she had used her powers to destroy \nVision\n, but that meant nothing as the \nSnap\n still happened. Maximoff moved closer and asked him to sympathize with her, asking if there was a universe where he could be happy with \nChristine Palmer\n, would not he go there. Strange refused to do so, and Maximoff told him to remember that what she did next was reasonable.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange watches \nScarlet Witch\n attacking\n \n \nMaximoff shot a blast of her \nchaos magic\n at him, but the protective shields surrounding the perimeter blocked her. Strange then descended down to stand by Wong and the Masters. As Maximoff furiously tried to break the shields, Strange observed her actions. He then saw that she had stopped blasting the shield and was trying to use her telepathy. She was able to mind control a student in removing his shield allowing for her to break inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange ordering all the \nMasters\n to fall back\n \n \nMaximoff blasted buildings and Masters aside, creating fires in the courtyards. Her blasts were strong enough to cause Strange to clutch his side. He then told everyone to fall back, knowing that they could not stop her. When Wong stayed behind, Strange yelled at him to follow.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to protect \nAmerica Chavez\n \n \nStrange used a trap that he set up to stall Maximoff by trapping her in the \nMirror Dimension\n. He and Wong met up with Chavez, who had been hiding in a room with \nHamir\n and another Master. He told her they needed to get her out of there as Kamar-Taj had fallen. Suddenly, doors slammed shut around them and Hamir and the Master were taken away through puddles on the floor. Strange realized that Maximoff was using reflections to escape the Dimension and told them to cover them up.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange listens to \nScarlet Witch\n's motives\n \n \nAlong with Wong and Chavez, Strange covered the reflections. Despite their efforts, Maximoff emerged from a gong and demanded Strange hand over Chavez. Strange attempted to talk some sense into Maximoff once more, by telling her that \nher\n \nchildren\n would not exist. Maximoff insisted that Billy and Tommy were present in other universes, and proved her point by telling them she would dream about her sons, before showing them how happy her other variants were with their children. Strange and Chavez sadly watched the visions projected from the pages of the Darkhold, before the book closed and Maximoff stated that \"she wakes up to find herself in the same nightmare\", referring to her world without her sons.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to stop \nScarlet Witch\n \n \nStrange then asked that, if she were to reach her boys in another universe, what would happen to their mother, to which Maximoff responded by gritting her teeth angrily at him. Sensing an incoming attack, Strange unhesitatingly summoned several serpentine \ndragons\n to attack Maximoff, only for them to be finished off quickly and then get thrown aside into a pillar. Maximoff then defeated Wong and began to capture Chavez.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange decides to save \nAmerica Chavez\n \n \nFortunately, as Maximoff began to absorb Chavez's power, the latter involuntarily opened one of her portals behind her. Strange took this as an opportunity to dive after her. In the process, Maximoff blasted a fiery ball of \nchaos magic\n, which burnt a hole in the \nCloak of Levitation\n as Strange and Chavez fell through the portal.\n[\n3\n]\nTrip Through the Multiverse\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange falling through the \nMultiverse\n \n \n\"Surprised you didn't puke.\"\n\"That's not my first weird trip, kid.\"\n\nAmerica Chavez\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nStrange and Chavez then plummeted fast leaving his universe and entering several alternate universes, including \nLiving Tribunal Statue World\n, \nSavage Land\n, \nUnderwater World\n, \nPipe World\n, \nMirror World\n, \nOnslaught Canyon World\n, \nPaint World\n, \nHYDRA World\n, \nCube World\n, and \nComic Book World\n, among others.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange asks \nAmerica Chavez\n if she's okay\n \n \nStrange and Chavez finally landed on the roof of a building in \nNew York City\n of Earth-838. Upon catching his breath, Strange asked Chavez if she was okay, to which she answered in amazement that he had saved her and was surprised that Strange did not vomit from the interdimensional trip. Strange recalled his first trip through the Multiverse that the \nAncient One\n sent him on to Chavez, and was intrigued by the way New York looked like in the alternate universe, only to be interrupted by his own stomach, and rushed over to a nearby chimney to go vomit into it, much to Chavez's disgust.\n[\n3\n]\nStranded on Earth-838\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange considers taking \nChavez\n's powers\n \n \n\"I don't know where \nit\n is. So, unless there's \nanother other me\n...\"\nDoctor Strange to \nAmerica Chavez\n[src]\nStrange demanded that \nAmerica Chavez\n open a portal to take them back to \nKamar-Taj\n to save \nWong\n from \nScarlet Witch\n, but she informed him that she was not in control of her powers. This frustrated Strange, and he began to vocalize how he would be in control if he had her powers, which began to frighten Chavez, having been betrayed by the other \nStrange\n, so he apologized.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange using \nMagic\n against \nPizza Poppa\n \n \nStrange then asked about Chavez's variants, but she explained that she had none, so they decided to locate Strange's \nvariant\n from the universe they were in. They then headed to the \nNew York Sanctum\n, and along the way, Chavez taught Strange the rules of Multiversal travel. When Chavez was caught stealing food by \nPizza Poppa\n, he questioned Strange on his costume, thinking that it was stolen. Pizza Poppa went to attack Strange, so he put a spell on Pizza Poppa, causing him to uncontrollably hit himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange has his memory displayed to him\n \n \nAs they continued through the streets, Strange asked Chavez more questions until he stepped on a memory machine platform, which displayed a memory of him and \nChristine Palmer\n on a date. Watching this made Strange get emotional, so he stepped off the platform. Chavez then used the machine and Strange saw the moment she gained her powers, which resulted in her \npar\nents\n being swept away into it and never to be seen again. Strange comforted Chavez, assuring her that her parents were still alive. They then talked about Strange's complicated relationship with Palmer.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange discovers the statue of \nhimself\n \n \nArriving at the Sanctum, Strange immediately saw a sculpture acting as a memorial for himself in that universe. The plaque said that Strange gave his life defeating \nThanos\n. Strange said that not all of him was bad. Chavez pointed out that if Strange was dead, there was a different master guarding the Sanctum. Strange then proceeded to see none other than \nBaron Mordo\n. Mordo walked up to Strange, initially looking serious. However, his serious face quickly faded into a smile as he openly greeted Strange as his brother, saying that his Strange knew they would meet one day. He then led Strange inside. Before following, Strange reminded himself to go on red.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange explaining the situation to \nMordo\n \n \nInside the Sanctum, Strange talked about how Scarlet Witch had the \nDarkhold\n. Mordo said that they had a Darkhold as well and he guarded it because of what could happen to it in the wrong hands. Strange was relieved for that as he drank his tea. Mordo then revealed and explained how Maximoff seemed to be \nDreamwalking\n, which meant that she could use the body of an alternate version of her. As Mordo explained, Strange started getting woozy. He looked over to Chavez who was passed out. Strange exclaimed to what he thought was his friend before he passed out himself.\n[\n3\n]\nTrial by the Illuminati\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange meeting another \nChristine Palmer\n \n \n\"Do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the \nScarlet Witch\n?\"\n\"Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to \ndreamwalk\n.\"\n\"No. No, you cannot, not unless you give me the \nBook of Vishanti\n.\"\nDoctor Strange and \nCaptain Marvel\n[src]\nStrange woke up in a cell with \nAmerica Chavez\n in a separate one. After failing to remove his cuffs, Strange tried to get information on what was going on, and discovered a \nvariant\n of \nChristine Palmer\n working there. She explained that they were being surveilled and tested, and that the universe they were in was Earth-838. Strange enquired about her relationship with his \nvariant\n, which she told him was complicated.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being escorted by \nUltron Sentries\n \n \nStrange then tried to warn Palmer about \nScarlet Witch\n coming after Chavez, but he was ignored. Strange began guessing what organization Palmer was associated with, including the \nAvengers\n, \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and \nHYDRA\n, but when \nBaron Mordo\n returned with \nUltron Sentries\n, he revealed that he was going to take Strange to the \nIlluminati\n. Strange was then let out of his cell, and he told Palmer to not let anyone hurt Chavez, as he was guided through the \nIlluminati Headquarters\n and brought to a new room.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange stands trial before the \nIlluminati\n \n \nInside, Mordo introduced Strange to the members of the Illuminati: \nCaptain Carter\n, \nBlack Bolt\n, \nCaptain Marvel\n, and \nMister Fantastic\n. Despite being on trial, Strange's arrogance kicked in and he repeatedly quipped and mocked the Illuminati. Mister Fantastic informed Strange that his presence in Earth-838 increased the possibility of an \nIncursion\n, which could destroy their reality. They then explained how their Strange formed the Illuminati to make the hard decisions, and now they were going to decide what to do with Strange and Chavez.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange learns about his \nvariant\n's true fate\n \n \nStrange, in attempt to defend himself, warned them that the \nScarlet Witch\n was a threat to the \nMultiverse\n, but he was shut down by Captain Marvel. Mister Fantastic explained that Strange was the greater danger, which confused Strange. The Illuminati, joined by \nProfessor X\n, told him about how the 838 version of Strange became corrupted by the \nDarkhold\n, and eventually destroyed another universe, and was then willingly \nexecuted\n. After this, the Illuminati suspected every Strange was capable of being dangerous.\n[\n3\n]\nAttack on the Illuminati Headquarters\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange discovers \nScarlet Witch\n has arrived\n \n \n\"You know, \nyou\n hated me where I came from. I bet secretly, 'my brother', you hated \nme here\n. You must've been so jealous. Do you know what? I bet you were thrilled when you heard I've been corrupted, hell, you probably gave me the \nDarkhold\n to begin with.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nBaron Mordo\n[src]\nAn alarm was then set off, as the \nIlluminati\n discovered that \nScarlet Witch\n had \ninfiltrated\n their \nheadquarters\n, not surprising Strange. The Illuminati left to face Scarlet Witch, leaving \nBaron Mordo\n and \nProfessor X\n to watch Strange. Before leaving, Professor X chose to trust Strange and revealed that there was a waypoint to the \nBook of Vishanti\n in the building.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange fighting against \n838-Baron Mordo\n \n \nAfter a while, Strange realized that the Illuminati were not coming back, and he chose to use that to antagonize Mordo into fighting him by accusing Mordo of being jealous of \n838-Strange\n and possibly even being responsible his corruption from the \nDarkhold\n. Strange's tactic worked, and Mordo drew his sword and attacked Strange, who managed to get Mordo to break his cuffs off one hand. This allowed Strange to put it on Mordo, disabling his \nmagic\n, forcing the two to use their fighting skills, resulting in Strange escaping from Mordo.\n[\n3\n]\nEntering the Gap Junction\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange being hugged by \nAmerica Chavez\n \n \n\"All right, \nBook\n. Give me what I need.\"\nDoctor Strange\n[src]\nStrange reunited with \nAmerica Chavez\n, who was joined by \nChristine Palmer\n. Chavez rushed to hug Strange as he asked if she was fine. Strange also was reunited with the \nCloak of Levitation\n, which had been repaired by Palmer. Strange asked Palmer about the \nBook of Vishanti\n, but she was unsure if she could trust him until Chavez vouched for him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange tries to slow down \nScarlet Witch\n \n \nPalmer led Strange and Chavez through the \nIlluminati Headquarters\n, but they were soon found by \nScarlet Witch\n. They made their way to a tunnel under the river with Scarlet Witch right behind them. To buy them time, Strange flooded part of the tunnel, trapping Scarlet Witch, allowing them to make it to the door where the book was being kept. Strange tried to open the door with \nmagic\n, but it did not work, making him realize it required a passkey. Palmer figured out it was the watch that she had given him, and the door opened to the \nGap Junction\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange approaching the \nBook of Vishanti\n \n \nSpotting the book, Strange landed on a platform, followed by Chavez and Palmer. Strange approached the book and grabbed it, but at that moment, Chavez was attacked by Scarlet Witch, who pulled the young girl into her grip. Palmer went to save Chavez, but Strange stopped her and fired a blast at Scarlet Witch, which she managed to deflect and fire back at him. This caused the book to be destroyed. Scarlet Witch then lifted Strange and Palmer into the air, and by using Chavez's powers, a portal was opened, and the two were thrown into it.\n[\n3\n]\nFighting a Corrupted Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange in the \nIncursion\n-destroyed reality\n \n \n\"Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your own universe, but maybe, you could help to save mine?\"\nDoctor Strange to \nDoctor Strange\n[src]\nUpon looking around the new reality that was collapsing in on itself, Strange and \nChristine Palmer\n realized that this universe had been destroyed by an \nIncursion\n. Understanding that \nAmerica Chavez\n did not have long before \nScarlet Witch\n would kill her, Strange decided to head towards the \nNew York Sanctum\n in hopes to find a variant of himself for help.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange explores the destroyed \nSanctum\n \n \nStrange and Palmer found the Sanctum, and observed how isolated it was. As they walked closer, Strange noticed the skeletons littering the ground as well as the trees bare and dying. Palmer remarked that this universe's Strange did not do a good job at stopping the Incursion, and Strange quipped that he would tell him she said that. Seeing his \nvariant\n through the window, Strange told Palmer to stay outside as he entered the Sanctum, carefully walking into it. As he walked up the long staircase, it creaked eerily.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange meets his \nalternate self\n \n \nReaching the top level, Strange was cautiously greeted by his variant, who asked him how he arrived in his universe, as well as getting him to verify his identity, so Strange told him about their \nsister\n and how she died due to drowning. Gaining the variant's trust, Strange explained that he wanted to escape this universe, which the variant interjected that he had tried and failed, revealing that he was in possession of the \nDarkhold\n, so Strange requested use of the book.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is confronted by \nhis variant\n \n \nHowever, his variant warned him against using the cursed book, saying that the Darkhold would not only impact the fate of reality, but it would also take a heavy toll on the user. Strange insisted his variant help him, but in response, he asked Strange if he was happy, referring to being asked that question by his \nChristine Palmer\n, and proceeded to reveal his past, in which he hunted down many counterparts of himself and killed them through \nDreamwalking\n. Now revealing a third eye, the variant reiterated how the Darkhold would exact a heavy toll.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange fights his \nvariant\n \n \nHis variant said that the only way that he could have the Darkhold would be if he gave him his version of Palmer, much to Strange's fury. Seeing no other options, Strange engaged him in a \nbattle\n with his variant, with Strange using musical notes around the Sanctum, and turning them into spells to attack his Darkhold-empowered variant.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange getting blasted with \ndark magic\n \n \nThroughout the fight, Strange struggled to win against his variant, due to the variant being empowered by the Darkhold; however, he eventually managed to turn the battle into his favor. He trapped all of his spells along with his variant's in a powerful energy ball, and then attacking his variant with it, allowing Strange to kill his counterpart and retrieve the Darkhold.\n[\n3\n]\nBattle on Mount Wundagore\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange uses \nmagic\n from the \nDarkhold\n \n \n\"\nDreamwalking\n, you hypocrite!\"\n\"This time, it's going to take more than killing me to kill me.\"\n\nScarlet Witch\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nUsing the retrieved \nDarkhold\n, Strange summoned red energy orbs surrounding him, spun them around until he viewed a vision of \nAmerica Chavez\n being drained through one of the orbs. Strange shoved the orbs into the Darkhold within a split second, and then began casting the spell of \ndreamwalking\n, making the illustrations on the page glow red. \nChristine Palmer\n entered and was furious with him, declaring that all Doctor Stranges in every universe were the same.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange prepares to \nDreamwalk\n \n \nHe agreed with Palmer and stated that right now, Chavez needed him, and he could not do this without Palmer's aid. Strange instructed her to protect his body from the \nSouls of the Damned\n while he would Dreamwalk. As he initiated the ritual, candles assembled around him, which he lit up with \nmagic\n. Strange positioned his fingers and closed his eyes before he levitated, and when Palmer questioned if a version of him needed to live in Earth-616, Strange asked who said the Variant had to be living.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange \nDreamwalks\n in his \nvariant\n's corpse\n \n \nWith the ritual commencing, Strange projected his consciousness into the decaying corpse of his \nalternate self\n he buried on a \nNew York City\n building in his home reality. The \nzombified\n Strange opened his eyes while he, in his real place, snarled softly. He outstretched his arm through the floor, and he unearthed himself, then wheezed at the sky full of lightning. The undead Strange struggled to step forward and his fingers were cracking as he used his \nSling Ring\n to open an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to \nMount Wundagore\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange controls the \nSouls of the Damned\n \n \nHe then was attacked by the demons, becoming overwhelmed. Palmer, alarmed, told him to use them to his advantage with his knowledge of the mystic arts. He grabbed them and used them as a cape to fly him over to the \nDarkhold Castle\n. Upon landing, he flapped the demons, creating winds that blew the \nElder Beasts\n off the ledge and into the abyss below.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange uses \ndemons\n to fight \nScarlet Witch\n \n \nStrange was then confronted by \nWanda Maximoff\n, who called him a hypocrite. Maximoff blasted him with her \nchaos magic\n and Strange tossed the demons at her in response. They carried her to the open wing of the Castle, where Strange and \nWong\n used an enchantment to keep Maximoff inside a prism. Strange then released Chavez from the spell and came to her side by the altar, where he encouraged her to be confident in her abilities. Maximoff then broke free, destroying the demons, and blasting Wong away. She angrily attacked Strange, nearly killing him, but was stopped by Chavez. Strange then watched as Chavez brought Maximoff to her \nvariant\n's \nhouse\n in Earth-838. He then watched as Maximoff broke free from the Darkhold, after she saw her \nalternate\n \nchildren\n returning to her normal self.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange gains closure with \nChristine Palmer\n \n \nMaximoff was left in tears as Chavez returned them back to their universe. Strange watched as Maximoff flew back to the altar and began destroying the Castle. As she did, Chavez and Wong left through a portal. Maximoff destroyed the Castle and Strange's variant's body, ultimately destroying Darkholds throughout the \nMultiverse\n. Strange broke out of his dreamwalking and spoke with Palmer, who stated that Maximoff did the right thing. He then told her that he loved her in every universe, and that it was not that he did not want to care or be cared for, but just that he got scared. They were then saved by Chavez, who opened a portal, and they returned to their universes.\n[\n3\n]\nAftermath\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange bows to \nWong\n at \nKamar-Taj\n \n \n\"How you feeling?\"\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\"You used the \nDarkhold\n to \ndreamwalk\n into your own \ncorpse\n.\"\n\"Oh. Yeah, right, that. Fine.\"\n\nWong\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nSoon after, Strange and \nWong\n rebuilt \nKamar-Taj\n and resumed teaching of the \nmystic arts\n. Strange observed \nAmerica Chavez\n, who was not a student but had troubles with using the \nSling Ring\n, which prompted Wong to compare Chavez's impatience to Strange's when he began training. After talking about Strange's \ndreamwalking\n experience, Strange asked Wong if he was happy, remarking that saving the world did not necessarily bring him happiness. Wong replied that despite everything, he was grateful for his current life. As a show of growth, Strange then bowed to Wong.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange says goodbye to \nAmerica Chavez\n \n \nAs Strange was about to leave and return to the \nNew York Sanctum\n by way of \nportal\n, he was approached by Chavez, who told him she had managed to make some sparks. Strange then told her that her \npar\nents\n would be proud and that he hoped they would get to see her again. Chavez told him she was happy she entered his universe, in which he agreed and said goodbye to her. Strange then walked through the portal and entered his Sanctum.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange develops a third eye\n \n \nStrange took his time to finally repair his watch that \nChristine Palmer\n gifted to him. Once it was fixed, he put it away, a gesture of him accepting and moving on from Palmer. Strange then decided to take a walk in the streets; however, he suddenly collapsed on the ground in the middle of a crosswalk and cried out in pain. As the results of his dreamwalking, Strange's third eye on his forehead opened, but Strange managed to take ahold of himself.\n[\n3\n]\nMultiversal Duties\n[\n]\nStopping an Incursion\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange is randomly approached by \nClea\n \n \n\"You caused an \nincursion\n, and we're going to fix it. Unless you're afraid.\"\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\nClea\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nSometime later, Strange was out for another walk when he was approached by a sorceress named \nClea\n. He asked her if he could help her, in which she stated that his recent actions caused an \nincursion\n and he needed to fix it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange and \nClea\n leave to fix an \nIncursion\n \n \nUsing a magic blade, Clea then tore open a portal to the \nDark Dimension\n in the air, causing nearby people to run away. She asked if he was afraid to join her but Strange, who had changed into his \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n robes, confidently replied that it was far from the truth, revealing his third eye to her. With no hesitation, the two then jumped into the portal and entered the Dark Dimension, heading off to fix the Incursion.\n[\n3\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"In the grand calculus of the \nMultiverse\n, their sacrifice means infinitely more than their lives. I'm sorry, kid. If they die, they die.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nPrior to his accident, Strange had a massive ego and pride that fueled his career. As a result, Strange only took on patients that he believed would help benefit his status, even refusing to heal a U.S. Army Colonel's back, albeit it was because this injury was a simple one any neurosurgeon can fix. His work was also driven by a desire to control death and time, which led him to refuse even looking into any patient he perceived to have little chance of recovery to avoid ruining his track record. However, if he also perceived the chance a patient could survive, he would help them recover even if it would not benefit his public image, showing that at his core, he does care about saving people. In addition, he seemed to prioritize his research over his physician work, as he stated his work would save thousands for years to come, whereas a physician would only save a handful of patients that they would have to directly interact with. This, however, changed after his accident, which left Strange a broken man and constantly frustrated due to being incapable of returning to the life he knew. Upon visiting \nKamar-Taj\n, Strange initially maintained his narrow-minded arrogance and stubbornly refused to believe that the \nAncient One\n was telling the truth until she forcibly demonstrated \nastral projection\n and sent him across multiple dimensions to prove her point.\nStrange has shown extreme determination and stubbornness, a useful trait in a doctor as he would never give up on his patients, even when one was called dead with a bullet in his brain. Also, Strange was able to determine the patient was still alive to successfully save him. He spent most of his remaining money in seven different surgeries to attempt to heal his hands to the point of near bankruptcy, remained outside of Kamar-Taj's front door for five hours after being initially thrown out, then spent most of his time at Kamar-Taj studying and improving his abilities, even going as far as studying while sleeping through astral projection. He even allowed himself to be violently killed by countless times by \nDormammu\n until he gave in to his demands and later giving up the \nTime Stone\n to \nThanos\n in exchange for saving \nTony Stark\n's life when he was about to be killed by the Mad Titan, even though wanted to save the Time Stone first. Despite his determined and stubborn attitude, Strange has shown to be the voices of reason to those around him.\nThrough his training with the Ancient One, Strange gained a newfound appreciation for the natural order of things due to his studies of the Mystic Arts and became humbler. However, this was not to say he was a completely changed man; he retained a cocky attitude when dealing with people and things, as seen in how he behaved when he went to borrow books from \nWong\n. This, coupled with his inquisitiveness and willingness to break rules, made him an odd one in Kamar-Taj and constantly an annoyance to many of his peers. However, due to this nature of his, he was also more willing to compromise and be somewhat flexible with his principles, quickly accepting that the Ancient One broke her own rules to do what was deemed necessary to protect the world, and he had to be willing to do so himself, which, when combined with his natural talent in the Mystic Arts, had the Ancient One name him as the new Master of the \nNew York Sanctum\n, despite his relative lack of training and inexperience.\nHaving trained as a doctor, Strange is a pacifist as he tries to avoid in killing and physically harming people, as it goes against the Hippocratic Oath. He was disgusted by his actions in killing \nLucian Aster\n, stating he became a doctor to save lives, not take them. However, neither the Ancient One nor \nKarl Mordo\n was especially sympathetic towards this, with the former stating it was his towering ego and delusion that he could control death itself that made him become a doctor and the latter simply calling him a coward for not having the spine to do what has to be done. Nevertheless, Strange claimed that there were other ways to defeat their enemies, a claim he ultimately proved correct by defeating Dormammu without killing him. However, overtime, Strange has come to terms that he would have to forsaken his pacifist in killing and physically harming people in order to do what's right, but it mostly shows that he did grow a spine in order to do what needed to be done. Strange even goes to the point of not caring what happens to anyone that has mental and physical issues, as shown when he was going to allow a group of villains from different universes with their own \nSpider-Man\n to return to their universes and meet their fates instead of helping them, which goes against his nature as a doctor, although his intentions were to preserve the safety of the \nMultiverse\n.\nDespite coming off as arrogant and genuinely selfish, Strange does show an emotional side, especially when it comes to those who are closest to him, as he nearly broke down after the Ancient One's death, saying goodbye to \nChristine Palmer\n, the prospect of losing his memory of \nPeter Parker\n, seeing the memory of Palmer giving him his watch, and having to recall his \nsister's\n death. Strange has even shown to have good and well-meaning intentions. Also, Strange shows loyalty to those he considers his allies or friends and would help them in anyway he could, even those he distrusts, as seen when he helped \nThor\n locate \nOdin\n so he and \nLoki\n would return to \nAsgard\n. In addition, Strange will show a soft spot for orphaned children or teenagers, as he showed this to Parker and \nAmerica Chavez\n. Strange has even been seen to be protective towards his friends and allies, as he will put his life on the line to ensure they were safe from harm. Also, Strange will go extended lengths to protect those he cares about, as seen when he gave up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for Stark's safety and used the \nDarkhold\n to \nDreamwalk\n into the corpse of his \ncounterpart\n to save Chavez from the \nScarlet Witch\n.\nStrange had lack of faith for others and believed that he can only trust himself, which can come off as both a good and bad thing. Also, due to his controlling tendencies, Strange would choose to go it alone and always had to be the one to hold the knife, as it caused him to not think things through in his intentions to help those he cares about and his relationship with Palmer to end, even though they remain friends. However, during his talk with Kaecilius, Strange began to see his own failings reflected in him and started showing signs of self-improvement, as shown when he expressed a newfound trust in \nNicodemus West\n. Also, upon seeing the actions of his \ncounterp\narts\n in their universes, Strange realized what he was becoming if he continued his obsession for control and realized that he needs to have confidence in the people around him.\nWhile he may look fearless, Strange on the inside has fears, as he is afraid of failure and losing those who are closes to him, as those fears came from his childhood trauma of having to watch his younger sister drown because he was unable to do anything to save her. The sense of helplessness that he felt that day has developed into a need to always keep everything under control, owing to his own fear of ever having to go through such trauma again. Although he won't admit it to others, Strange does confess during his talk with the Ancient One before her death, that his fear of failure is what pushed him to be a successful neurosurgeon. Strange also confessed to the alternate \nChristine Palmer\n that even though he wants someone to care for and someone to do the same for him, but gets scared because of his fear of losing those who are closes to him. In addition, Strange is greatly distracted by even the slightest sound when he requires absolute focus. This was shown when he was operating on a patient and asked West to cover his watch as the ticking was distracting him, this even extended to his performing of spells, as Spider-Man's constant chattering in an attempt to make alterations to his spell distracted him and made him lose control of it and break open the multiverse. \nThrough his fear of losing those who are closest to him, Strange tries not to hurt or damage the lives of those around him, as seen when he was reluctant to tell his friends and fellow superheroes, especially Stark, the outcome against Thanos as he hoped for another way to defeat him until he realized that there was not and had no choice but to make sure the only victory against the Mad Titan would happen and how he hesitated and got emotional in going through with the spell that would make himself and the world forget Peter Parker. However, Strange had been secretly blaming himself for sacrificing Stark's life as he felt responsible for how the lives of his friends and allies got damaged because of his actions, in spite of his efforts saved the universe. This was shown when Strange felt at fault for Parker's identity as Spider-Man getting exposed by one of his \nenemies\n and ruining his life, which contributed to his decision to help the boy. Strange also showed remorse for and sympathized with Wanda Maximoff, as he felt guilty, because he gave Thanos the Time Stone, that she had to kill \nsomeone\n she loved to stop the Mad Titan, which turned out to be for nothing, created a hex in a \ntown\n, got corrupted by the Darkhold, and became the Scarlet Witch. However, Strange's guilt was mostly because he had come to see Stark and Parker as his friends.\nAlthough he has a good heart, Strange has shown to get easily annoyed and frustrated with everyone around him, especially his friends and allies, as he can be harsh and would lose his temper with them at times. Also, Strange has let his pride get the better of him, as he would place the blame on others instead of taking responsibility for his actions and mistakes. This is shown when Strange blamed Palmer, West and other doctors for ruining his life because he would not accept the fact that the car accident was caused by his carelessness and lack of regard for his safety, and Parker for botching up the spells that was meant to help restore his secret identity as Spider-Man, even though they were both to blame for the incident. Also, Strange can sound heartless whenever he was upset and does not listen to reason, even when his friends or allies call him out for his behavior, as seen when he was unfazed when Parker told him to have a heart. However, despite his annoyances, frustration and pride, Strange has shown to be understanding as he gets that those around him had good intentions and their hearts were in the right place. Also, Strange would make an honest effort in making amends for his actions and mistakes, especially if he realized how badly he messed up, hurt and pushed those he cares about away.\nAfter taking his talk with the Ancient One to the heart, Strange showed strong selflessness, as seen during his battle with Dormammu, allowing himself to be killed over and over in order to keep him trapped in the time loop so mankind could live and let go of his fear of failure. Also, through the alternate Palmer encouragement to face his other fears, Strange decided to put them behind him, although he would always have his fear of losing those who are closest to him. In addition, after realizing the error of his controlling ways and the consequences that came with it, Strange decided to not make the same mistakes his counterparts have made and to trust those around him. Strange even admits to the alternate Palmer that he and his counterparts were all the same because of their controlling tendencies, as seen when he was left with no choice but to use the Darkhold to help Chavez beat the Scarlet Witch. However, Strange assured the alternate Palmer that his intentions of using the Darkhold were well-meaning and needed her help, which shows that he was putting faith in those around him instead of going it alone.\nHowever, despite demonstrating tremendous maturity, Strange does maintain some of his old habits such as making sarcastic comments and jokes when talking to others, such as when he was put on trial before the \nIlluminati\n and he chose to mock each of them, despite the fact that they were going to decide his fate. He also retains his meticulous and diligence by forming a watchlist of individuals that might pose a threat to Earth, such as Loki. Strange's greatest strength is his flexibility and open mind, as shown when he used the Time Stone to give himself and Mordo a second chance in stopping the \nHong Kong Sanctum\n from getting destroyed by Kaecilius and letting Dormammu into their universe. Strange's imagination and intellect have given him a vastly flexible personality, so much so the Ancient One could never see exactly what his future would be, only possible paths he would take. Due to his inquisitiveness, Strange is easily able to adapt and teach himself light years ahead of even experienced sorcerers like Mordo and Kaecilius. Once he started to get the hang of his sorcery studies, he began to teach himself and was able to learn at an accelerated rate. Also, through his intelligence, Strange is able to imagine unorthodox solutions to problems, even when he lacked experience of using powerful magical relics. \nAfter his car crash, Strange's hands suffered from constant shaking, as it became a problem during his training in the Mystic Arts. However, due to his training as a sorcerer, Strange's hand shaking faded over time. Also, when the Accident One told him that \nJonathan Pangborn\n used magic for his legs so he can walk, Strange thought about doing the same thing for his hands at first but decided not to, presumably to be reminded of his mistakes in the past that led him to leave his old life as a neurosurgeon behind and the beginning of his new one as a sorcerer/superhero.\nDuring his new life as a sorcerer and superhero, Strange has learned to comprehend his limits and despite his success at the hands of Dormammu's defeat, he has begun to realize the natural order should not be entirely disturbed, the same reason why Mordo left the Mystic Arts and vowed to never use the Eye of Agamotto until he was fully prepared, as he came to terms with the fact that time is beyond even his control. In addition, Strange does see potential in individuals that also possess magic abilities, as shown with \nNed Leeds\n, even though he was initially skeptical, when he was impressed that he opened a portal without any training and Chavez when she told him that she made some sparks. Although he has become a strong sorcerer over time, Strange still lacked the compassion and velocity of being a superhero, but does care about helping and saving lives. However, upon seeing Parker's selflessness and beliefs, Strange realized what it truly means to be a hero. Through this newfound perspective of being a superhero, Strange opened up in protecting the innocent and that everyone deserves a second chance, whether they are good or bad, as seen when he gave Maximoff various chances of redemption, even though she was possessed by the Darkhold, as he knew there was still good within her and was proven right with Chavez's help.\nIn the beginning, Strange attempted to make Wong laugh and befriend him, although Strange did earn Wong's respect when he witnessed his natural talent for the Mystic Arts. However, during the events with Kaecilius and Dormammu, Strange earned Wong's friendship as he took upon himself to finish his training and mentor him in the absence of the Ancient One. Over time, Strange came to see Wong not only his strongest ally but also his best friend. Despite his strong friendship with Wong, Strange does clash with him at times, but does not argue with him. Also, Strange does get annoyed with Wong's lack of faith in him as a sorcerer, but knows that he still trusts him as a friend. Strange has shown to have enough faith in Wong to look after the New York Sanctum whenever he is absent.\nThrough his friendship and soft spot for Parker, Strange attempted to become a father-figure to him and tried to guide him just like Stark did, although he did it mostly out of his guilt in inadvertently causing Iron Man's death as he was aware of their close relationship. Strange even came to respect Parker's friends, as he did not argue back when \nMichelle Jones\n called him out for blaming the whole botched up spell on Spider-Man and does not get angry at Leeds for using his \nSling Ring\n. Also, Strange was impressed with Parker's intelligence and came to admire his kindness towards those in need. In addition, Strange hesitated in going though with Parker's plans in casting a spell to make everyone in their universe, including himself, forget his civilian identity to preserve the Multiverse and fix the mistake they have made, but eventually went through with it and in the process ended up respecting Spider-Man for his selfless and mature choice. Although he now has no memory of his civilian identity, Strange deep down still held onto Parker's influences and how he showed him the right path of being a superhero.\nAt first, Strange was annoyed with Chavez because of her smart-aleck attitude and that she had no supervision or being shown the differences between from right and wrong, such as stealing. However, Strange ended up bonding with Chavez as they form a father-daughter relationship, as he decided to help Wong take care of her when she decided to stay in their universe. Also, Strange encouraged and believed in Chavez, as he inspired her to fight back against the Scarlet Witch and find the strength in controlling her powers. In addition, Strange helped and guided Chavez in the way of a superhero, as he used what he learned from his forgotten friendship with Parker to do so.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"You were born for the \nMystic Arts\n.\"\n\nWong\n to Stephen Strange\n[src]\nMagic\n: As the master of the \nNew York Sanctum\n and a former candidate for the position of Sorcerer Supreme,\n[\n21\n]\n Doctor Strange possesses an extremely high level of mastery over magic which he used to defend his native reality. With the death of the \nAncient One\n, Doctor Strange is currently the most powerful member of the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n. Indeed, despite his initial inexperience, an impressed \nKarl Mordo\n and \nWong\n claimed that Strange's prodigious skills meant that he was \"born for the mystic arts,\" and the Ancient One herself noted that Strange has tremendous potential as a sorcerer. Indeed, even while still inexperienced, Strange was able to use the powers of the \nTime Stone\n's container, the \nEye of Agamotto\n, quite effectively and safely, despite it being considered to be very dangerous for the natural order. With the help of numerous mystical artifacts and relics, in addition to his astral powers, Strange is able to gain access to a multitude of mystical powers. Strange makes up for his lack of experience with his gifted intellect, photographic memory and ingenuity, as he swiftly imprisoned \nLoki\n, an extremely skilled master of \nAsgardian\n sorcery, and even defeated \nKaecilius\n by outsmarting \nDormammu\n, forcing the latter to leave \nEarth\n alone and take Kaecilius with him. By the time of the \nInfinity War\n, Strange dramatically improved his power and skill in magic as he had received more training and gained more experience. He proved capable of single-handedly combating \nThanos\n' use of the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n more effectively than the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n and even \nIron Man\n, with even the \nTitan\n himself praising Strange for his use of the Mystic Arts. The Ancient One stated long before Doctor Strange became a Master of the Mystic Arts that he was always meant to be the best of them. Later on, Doctor Strange was able to grow his power to such a level that he was able to contend against the likes of \nScarlet Witch\n, despite her superior innate power. After tapping into the power of the \nDarkhold\n and accessing his third eye, Strange's magic increased to unknown levels.\nEldritch Magic\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange wielding his \nTao Mandalas\n in battle\n \n \n Strange is able to shape and manipulate \nEldritch Magic\n, forming tangible constructs of energy, such as weapons or shields, as well as cast spells by writing specific formations with the fiery energy. Strange had demonstrated the ability to form his \nEldritch Whips\n and \nTao Mandalas\n, the latter of which he was even capable of conjuring the \nShield of the Seraphim\n to shield himself, Iron Man, and Spider-Man from the impact of \nEbony Maw\n's \nQ-Ship\n crashing on \nTitan\n. During the \nBattle of Titan\n, Strange demonstrated being able to conjure platforms for his allies to walk upon, as shown when \nStar-Lord\n jumped across them to attack \nThanos\n. Additionally, he was able to craft a sword from Eldritch Magic that he used to engage the Titan alongside \nDrax\n. Strange was able to imbue one of Spider-Man's web-shooters with Eldritch Magic, thus allowing the web-shooters to fire webs of Eldritch Magic that teleported their targets to the cells in the dungeon. Strange was also able to go intangible by surrounding himself in an aura of Eldritch magic to escape the dungeon after Spider-Man put him into it. He can also create other weapons like a saw to cut through a bus thrown by \nGargantos\n as well as use the musical notes on sheet music to throw at \nSinister Strange\n.\nSpell Casting\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange casting the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n \n \n Utilizing magic, Doctor Strange can cast various spells as long as he has practiced them prior to the casting. Strange used a locator spell by scanning a piece of Thor's hair with fiery energy, briefly conjuring Odin's symbol in the process, to aid in forming a portal directly to Odin. He conjured the \nWinds of Watoomb\n, which cleared the street of smoke and debris after \nEbony Maw\n's \nQ-Ship\n landed in Greenwich Village, while also stopping the destructive windstorm the ship was causing. The smoke was expelled from the street and towards the sky. Strange also used the spell to hold back the lake outside the \nAvengers Compound\n from rushing into the battlefield after its foundations were breached, gathering the water into a funnel and pushing it away. To protect the \nEye of Agamotto\n from being stolen by Ebony Maw, Strange cast a spell upon the relic that burned anyone that attempts to take it, making it seemingly impossible to remove it unless the spell was removed, even if he were killed. Strange cast the \nShield of the Seraphim\n to proect \nIron Man\n, \nSpider-Man\n and himself when they crashed landed on Titan. During the \nBattle of Titan\n, Strange conjured the \nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\n to restrain \nThanos\n' hand so he couldn't use the power of the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n. The bands were much stronger than the usual Eldritch Whip he uses to restrain enemies, notably able to restrict Thanos' use of the Gauntlet for a considerable period of time, although Thanos was able to eventually break out and redirect the force of the bands to knock Strange away. Strange also projected a spell in front of himself that transformed a singularity sent by Thanos into multitudes of blue butterflies, impressing the Mad Titan. During the same battle, Strange cast the \nImages of Ikonn\n to create dozens of copies of himself to attack Thanos with their Eldritch Whips. The duplicates, however, were quickly dispersed when Thanos released a wave of energy using the \nPower\n and \nSoul Stone\n, with only the real Strange remaining. During the \nBattle of Earth\n, Strange opened up numerous chasms in the earth, producing glowing purple tendrils of energy that forcefully lifted up \nThanos\n' soldiers and dragged them into the ground before resealing themselves and vanishing. Strange temporarily enchanted Spider-Man's \nWeb-Shooters\n, infusing its webs with the ability to transport individuals to his dungeon on contact. With his portals, Strange was able to teleport Peter Parker and Otto Octavius to his dungeon, without being anywhere near them. An important spell that Strange has cast is the \nRunes of Kof-Kol\n that erased everyone's memory that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. However, this also included himself. Strange was able to design a circular saw made of energy to split a bus thrown by \nGargantos\n in half, as well as cast a spell that revealed the giant monster when it was invisible. During an altercation with a \nstreet vendor\n in the \nIlluminati\ns universe, Strange caused him to squirt mustard onto his own face and repeatedly punch and grapple with himself, an effect that would go on to last three weeks. During his fight with Sinister Strange, he was able to make tangible musical notes of energy from nearby music sheets before launching them like shurikens at his corrupt doppelgnger, as well as create force-fields.\nPortal Creation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange travels to \nCentral Park\n via a portal\n \n \n Using a \nSling Ring\n, Strange is able to open portals that lead to different locations, gaining the ability to both move across the material world and to other parts of the \nMultiverse\n. Strange can also teleport others at great speeds, with him notably causing a portal to move and engulf \nThor\n and \nLoki\n, sending them to \nOdin\n's location, as well as rapidly open portals for \nStar-Lord\n and \nSpider-Man\n during their fight with Thanos. In addition, he can make portals small enough to reach through and grab things, such as several books from \nWong\n's library or to exchange one object for another, as the portal he used to abduct Loki left a card bearing the address to the \nNew York Sanctum\n in his place. Strange is also able to conjure portals cooperatively, as, during \nEbony Maw\n's attempt to retrieve the \nTime Stone\n, he and \nWong\n conjured separate portals to redirect several brick daggers back to Maw. There seem to be no limits to the distance Strange can reach with this power.\nDimensional Travel\n: Using the same Sling Ring, Strange can travel between different dimensions of the \nMultiverse\n, crossing over different planes of existence or traveling across various forms of reality. Furthermore, Strange can forcibly transport others to another dimension, and later retrieve them, as he did when temporarily imprisoning \nLoki\n in a dimension where he was constantly falling, leaving him there for thirty minutes until Thor asked for his release. When the \nBlack Order\n arrived to retrieve the \nTime Stone\n, Strange and Wong were able to send an attack by Ebony Maw back by opening portals to a void-like dimension.\nEnergy Projection\n: Strange can project energy blasts, streams, and bolts of fiery energy. He notably generated powerful torrents of energy that ricocheted off several floating boulders, melting the surfaces they touched as they went, to attack Thanos. While fighting \nWanda\n at the \nGap Junction\n, Strange created a concentrated beam of intense energy. During his fight against \nSinister Strange\n, he conjured energy blasts using musical notes.\nMirror Dimension Magic\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange deflecting \nThanos\n' attack\n \n \n After his training at \nKamar-Taj\n, Doctor Strange is able to manipulate Mirror Dimension Magic. Strange was notably able to access the \nMirror Dimension\n and transport himself, \nKarl Mordo\n, and the \nZealots\n within the parallel reality with ease. Additionally, Strange was also capable of conjuring a construct of the \nMirror Dimension\n in the form of crystalline fractals that acted as a shield, absorbing an energy beam from the Power Stone, and was also able to send the fractals at Thanos. Strange can warp space within the Mirror Dimension, as demonstrated during his skirmish with \nSpider-Man\n within the dimension. He was able to trap \nScarlet Witch\n in the Mirror Dimension for a short time before she used her reality warping to break free through the reflections in the ground and objects.\nAstral Projection\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange's astral form fighting \nLucian Aster\n \n \n Strange is capable of separating his astral form from his body, gaining access to the \nAstral Dimension\n. He notably was able to assist \nChristine Palmer\n in operating on his physical body, demonstrating being able to make himself visible to her at will, using the use of the Mirror Dimension as a medium. Strange's astral body could also make his physical body glow from the inside out by putting his hand through it and touching it, which he used to allow Christine to better see his wound when she operated on him. As the \nAncient One\n was dying, Strange was able to use his astral form to communicate with her astral form before her physical death. Notably, Strange found that as Palmer defibrillated his real body, his astral form would send out a blast of energy, which he used offensively while grappling with \nLucian Aster\n's astral form, ultimately destroying it and killing him.\nConjuration\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange conjuring mystical beings\n \n \n Strange was able to make an umbrella stand appear in front of Thor for him to put down \nMjlnir\n, which had been disguised as an umbrella, as well as make a tea cup appear in Thor's hand. He also was able to hide the \nTime Stone\n after secretly removing it from the \nEye of Agamotto\n and later made it appear between his fingers, allowing it to float over to \nThanos\n. During his fight with \nGargantos\n, he summoned a throwing axe to sever one of the creature's tentacles and caused it to vaporize. Strange was also able to summon a giant cat head from another dimension to eat a car before it hit a civilian. He also conjured two massive, bestial hands to grab a pole to use it to defeat the octopus creature. Strange summoned extra-dimensional serpents to fight \nScarlet Witch\n.\nTransmutation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange transmutes his suit into his robes\n \n \n During his meeting with \nThor\n, Strange was able to turn a cup of tea into a large mug of beer that was also able to magically refill itself, much to Thor's pleasant surprise. After \nBruce Banner\n crashed through the roof of the Sanctum, Strange was able to seamlessly transform the normal street clothes he was wearing into his blue robes. He repeated this process again when he changed from his suit to his blue robe so he could fight \nGargantos\n. He also turned \nChristine Palmer\n's beverage into red wine by pointing at her glass.\nTeleportation\n: Strange, while in the \nNew York Sanctum\n, was able to transport himself and \nThor\n around the building with ease, which was heavily disorienting to the Asgardian. At one point, he accidentally caused an entire bookshelf that Thor was leaning against to be brought along with them, before returning it and Thor to its previous location. However, he usually chooses to use his Sling Ring to teleport instead.\nFire Manipulation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange summoning Flames of the Faltine\n \n \n Strange can generate and control the element of fire. He used this power to light a fire in the fireplace at the sanctum. He also summoned a type of green fire when fighting against \nGargantos\n.\nTelekinesis\n: Strange can influence objects and people with mere gestures, occasionally enveloping them with orange energy while doing so. He was able to use telekinesis to take away the \nSling Ring\n from \nNed Leeds\n, and the \nMacchina di Kadavus\n from \nMichelle Jones\n. He was also able to use his telekinesis to tie his tie as well as pulling a bus apart and put it back together using Mirror Dimension Magic. He would later open a grave for his \ndeceased Variant\n on top of a roof, manipulated a \nstreet vendor\n's arm to stop him from spraying him with mustard and would open a metal gate with a raise of his arm while fleeing \nScarlet Witch\n through a tunnel.\nLevitation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange levitating in the air\n \n \n Using the \nCloak of Levitation\n, Strange is able to levitate and hover. The Cloak can greatly lessen the impact of falling from great heights by effortlessly reducing his speed. He used his cloak to reach the heights of \nScarlet Witch\n in the air to reason with her before her eventual attack and destruction of \nKamar-Taj\n.\nFormer Powers\n[\n]\n\"Just as you gave \nKaecilius\n powers from \nyour dimension\n, I've brought a little power from mine. This is time. Endless, looped time.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nDormammu\n[src]\nTime Manipulation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange reversing time\n \n \n Using the \nEye of Agamotto\n, Strange could control the flow of time or be it on a small or massive scale, notably to turn back something to a previous state, accelerating its time in order to apply changes that have not happened yet, or to lock in a time loop, with time resetting over and over until he stops its effect. Despite having safely and effectively handled the Time Stone's powers, Strange still concluded that he was not ready to use it liberally yet and decided to return it until he was ready to use it again. By the time of the Infinity War, it seems that Strange has mastered the Time Stone's powers, as he was confident he can use it safely in battle. Apparently seeing that the \nonly future that led to victory\n involved the \nSnap\n taking place first as well as \nIron Man\n's survival, Strange willingly surrendered the Time Stone to \nThanos\n in exchange for sparing Iron Man's life, losing the ability to use it. He first tested the ability on an apple, rewinding time on it to make it whole and then forwarding time to make it rot, despite not actually eating it to that point beforehand. If interrupted while using this ability, time freezes until he resumes the spell. He even used it to make a reconstruction of the stolen pages of the \nBook of Cagliostro\n and read from it, though he seemed to be unable to make the page real and only could reveal what had been there before. Strange notably used the ability to trap \nDormammu\n himself in a temporal loop, which would reset each time he killed Strange, keeping Dormammu from leaving his dimension to invade Earth until he agreed to leave Earth for good.\nParachronal Cognition\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange viewing potential futures\n \n \n He was able to use the Eye of Agamotto to peer into various futures just like the \nAncient One\n did, so as to gain insight into all the results of the upcoming conflict against Thanos and his \nferocious crusade\n. Strange saw that there was only \none future\n where he and his allies won while over 14 million more were lost against Thanos. Seeing all the scenarios for how the Infinity War could end required him to exert an immense amount of energy, as he had to live them and then die in each one physically, and right before he died he had to reset and repeat, and took notes as he went.\n[\n24\n]\n\"What are you doing with the \nDarkhold\n? Are you going to \nDreamwalk\n?\"\n\"It's a little bit more than just Dreamwalking.\"\n\nChristine Palmer\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nDark Magic\n: In order to stop the \nScarlet Witch\n while in another universe, Strange was forced to use that universe's \nDarkhold\n, despite knowing the risks. The use of this caused the \nSouls of the Damned\n to come for Strange, but they were fought off by \nChristine Palmer\n using the \nBrazier of Bom'Galiath\n.\nDreamwalking\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor Strange \ndreamwalking\n \n \n With the \nDarkhold\n, Strange \ndreamwalked\n into his \nalternate self's\n corpse, which was laying in a roof. Strange used an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to get to the \nMount Wundagore\n. He was then attacked by \nSouls of the Damned\n, but was skilled enough to use them and make wings. He then flew over to the \nDarkhold Castle\n and fought \nScarlet Witch\n. However, he was no match for her and had to talk \nAmerica Chavez\n into defeating her.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?\"\n\"I've got a photographic memory. It's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.\"\n\nKarl Mordo\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nGenius-Level Intellect\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange studying the \nBook of Cagliostro\n \n \n Strange has a photographic memory and perfect recall had originally greatly aided him in medical school, helping him to earn both his M.D. and Ph.D. simultaneously, going on to become one of the world's most renowned neurosurgeons, and later proving himself equally prodigious in the study of mystic arts. During his mystic arts studies in \nKamar-Taj\n, Strange managed to master entering the \nAstral Dimension\n, despite \nWong\n not believing him to be ready. When Strange used the \nEye of Agamotto\n to restore the missing pages from the \nBook of Cagliostro\n, he only saw the page for about 15 seconds, but was able to learn about \nDormammu\n, the \nDark Dimension\n, and the ritual for eternal life as well as work out the ritual and deduce how the \nAncient One\n has remained alive for so long. He proved to be capable of intellectually sparring with \nTony Stark\n and \nThanos\n.\n\"No one could have done better.\"\n\"I could have done better.\"\n\nChristine Palmer\n and Doctor Strange\n[src]\nMaster Physician\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor Strange performing a surgery\n \n \n Strange was one of the world's most renowned neurosurgeons. His genius surgical skill allowed him to flawlessly perform extremely complicated surgeries with little to no mechanical assistance. Indeed, Strange's skills were superior to those of his colleagues \nChristine Palmer\n and \nNicodemus West\n, as he was able to notice a cause of injury in a patient while neither of them could, thus preventing West from killing the patient. Strange's perfect record and reputation with the craft reached such a point that ultimately, he developed a penchant for undertaking only the most challenging but still viable of operations, in order to boost his huge ego. Despite losing the ability to perform surgeries after his hands were damaged beyond repair in a catastrophic car accident, Strange still kept his profound medical knowledge, which allowed him to give out directions to Palmer and West during surgery on the \nAncient One\n. During his surgical career, Strange was able to develop entirely new techniques for performing highly complicated surgical procedures that he claimed would significantly advance medical practices for years to come. Strange was even able to perform surgery during the extremely stressful \nBattle of New York\n.\n\"Strange is meant to be the best of us.\"\n\"So, he must've done it for a reason.\"\n\nAncient One\n and \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nExpert Tactician\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange leading the defense of \nKamar-Taj\n \n \n Strange's tremendous intellect contributes to his already incredible tactical insight. A highly ingenious strategist, Strange relied on pure wits to stop both \nKaecilius\n and \nDormammu\n himself due to his lack of experience in fighting supernatural forces. He used the \nEye of Agamotto\n to trap the primordial entity in an endless time loop while using tactics of psychological warfare to mentally torment Dormammu instead of stopping him with magic and, as a result, ultimately succeeded in forcing his foe back into the \nDark Dimension\n, taking the \nZealots\n along with him.\n\"You may regret that. \nHe\n brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\"\nDoctor Strange to \nThanos\n[src]\nMaster Martial Artist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange fighting against \nKarl Mordo\n \n \n After studying under the guidance of the \nAncient One\n and training with \nKarl Mordo\n for months, Strange became proficient in martial arts, both armed and hand-to-hand combat, with his skill being great enough to allow him to fight off and evade many of the far more experienced and extensively trained \nZealots\n sorcerers attacks while trying to escape the \nNew York Sanctum\n, overpower and kill \nLucian Aster\n, and even managing to hold his own against \nKaecilius\n himself reasonably well, with Strange notably managing to fight Kaecilius almost to a standstill in their last altercation by using the reconstructing landscape of Hong Kong to his advantage, although he was ultimately overpowered and only defeated Kaecilius by outsmarting him rather than defeating him in pure skill. Eventually, as he further practiced and trained, by the time of the \nInfinity War\n, Strange's skill and experience in fighting had improved significantly to the point that with help from Drax, Strange was even able to fight against Thanos himself in close-quarters combat, lasting longer than Drax, although Thanos only had the use of one eye due to the other being blinded by a webbed cotton and is quick to overwhelm Strange soon after beating back Drax. However, Strange's hands still suffer from severe nerve and bone damage as a result of his accident, further exacerbated by the unsuccessful surgeries made towards restoring his dexterity, meaning his hands are delicate and prone to intense pain should he attempt to directly strike something or someone, thus leading his technique to consist mainly of a combination of parries and the use of spells. During his fight with an alternate \nKarl Mordo\n, he proved himself capable of blocking, dodging and countering his attacks as well as effectively landing his own when neither one of them were using their magic, despite his hands still being injured. Strange is also proficient with weapons, as he wielded an Eldritch sword against \nThanos\n and threw a conjured axe to chop off one of \nGargantos\n' tentacles.\nWhip Mastery\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange fights \nKaecilius\n with \nEldritch Whip\n \n \n Strange was able to form \nEldritch Whips\n which he used in various ways. He was able to pull back \nThanos\n with the whips as well as attacking \nGargantos\n.\nBilingualism\n: Strange is fluent in his native English, and becomes proficient enough with Sanskrit during his months in \nKamar-Taj\n to enable him to study advanced books Wong deemed him not ready for, including the \nBook of Cagliostro\n.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\n\"The \nCloak of Levitation\n... it came to you.\"\n\"No minor feat. It's a fickle thing.\"\n\nKarl Mordo\n and \nAncient One\n[src]\nCloak of Levitation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange first finding the \nCloak of Levitation\n \n \n A mantle that enables Doctor Strange to levitate and hover in the air. It appears to be sentient and can move on its own power, causing it to move and flap in the air without the presence of wind. Offensively, the cloak's ability to move and fly with or without a wearer allows it to grab, lift, tackle or send enemies flying through the air. The cloak assists Strange in combat by protecting him from attacks, preventing his enemies like \nLucian Aster\n and \nThanos\n from blindsiding him, as well as attacking enemies on its own whenever possible, and doing maneuvers that are difficult for most humans to do.\nSling Ring\n: A mystical object which enables the wearer to open an \nInter-Dimensional Portal\n to another location.\nEye of Agamotto\n: An ancient relic with a number of mystical properties, especially time manipulation in the user's immediate vicinity and on specific areas or targets. Originally the containment vessel for the \nTime Stone\n, it was still worn by Strange following the Stone's destruction.\n\"You don't know how to use that, do you?\"\n\nKaecilius\n to Doctor Strange\n[src]\nBrazier of Bom'Galiath\n: During his battle with \nKaecilius\n in the \nNew York Sanctum\n, Strange found himself overpowered and grabbed the first weapon he could find which was the \nBrazier of Bom'Galiath\n, only for Kaecilius to call him out on his lack of knowledge about it, resulting in Strange simply throwing it.\nRotunda of Gateways\n: During his fight with Kaecilius and his Zealots in the \nNew York Sanctum\n, Strange used the Rotunda of Gateways he had found earlier, to trap one of the Zealots in the desert and the other, \nLucian Aster\n, in the jungle, leaving only himself and Kaecilius to continue fighting throughout the Sanctum.\nCrimson Bands of Cyttorak\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange reaching for the armor\n \n \n While fighting Kaecilius, Strange was advised by the \nCloak of Levitation\n to use a suit of armor attached to the wall. Although initially skeptical that they would have any benefit, Strange relented and threw the armor at Kaecilius, who became entrapped in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak, ending their fight although Kaecilius was later able to escape.\nCauldron of the Cosmos\n: Stationed in the main hallway of the \nNew York Sanctum\n was the Cauldron of the Cosmos, which the Cloak of Levitation stopped \nTony Stark\n from disrespectfully leaning against.\nMagic Inhibitor\n: When Strange was detained by the \nIlluminati\n, Magic Inhibitors were placed around his wrists to prevent him from using \nMagic\n.\nFormer Equipment\n[\n]\n\"I don't have the \nTime Stone\n anymore.\"\nStephen Strange to \nPeter Parker\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nStrange surrendering the Time Stone\n \n \nTime Stone\n: Upon taking the role of one of the \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n, Strange was vowed to protect one of the \nInfinity Stones\n housed within the \nEye of Agamotto\n. Initially unaware of its true power, Strange experimented with the Stone to rot and grow back an apple, before using it to undo \nKaecilius\n' attempt to destroy \nHong Kong\n before trapping \nDormammu\n into a time loop which he was unable to escape from. As Strange prepared to battle \nThanos\n, he used the Stone to see into the future in an attempt to find any possible way they could be victorious in their clash against the Mad Titan. Strange was later forced to give Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark.\nDarkhold\n: Strange used the Darkhold from \nSinister Strange\n's reality to take over \nDefender Strange\n's corpse, wanting to save \nAmerica Chavez\n from \nScarlet Witch\n. However, he was attacked by \ndemons\n, as taking control over corpses was forbidden, but thanks to \nChristine Palmer\n he remained unharmed. After Wanda destroyed the book throughout the Multiverse, he left alternate Strange's corpse and returned to his own body. However, after a while it was found that the Darkhold had left a mark on him: a third eye on his forehead.\nVehicles\n[\n]\n2015 Lamborghini Huracn\n: Strange used to own and drive a Lamborghini Huracn, however, while he was driving to one of his speaking events, Strange became distracted by \nBilly\n's descriptions of a potential patient and lost control. Strange would drive his car off a hill as a result, destroying the car, and crushing his hands during the impact.\nQ-Ship\n: After the \nAttack on Greenwich Village\n, \nEbony Maw\n took Strange to the Q-Ship in order to extract the \nTime Stone\n from the \nEye of Agamotto\n and deliver it to \nThanos\n on \nTitan\n. However, \nIron Man\n and \nSpider-Man\n \nrescued\n Strange by sending Maw to the vacuum of space, killing him. Strange eventually agreed to use the Q-Ship to confront Thanos on Titan and used a protection spell to prevent it from crash-landing to its destination.\nFacilities\n[\n]\nMetro-General Hospital\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange walking with Palmer\n \n \n After graduating, Stephen Strange started working in the ER at Metro-General Hospital. At this hospital, he met \nChristine Palmer\n who he became very close with. He then worked as a successful neurosurgeon until early 2016. On the night of \nFebruary 2nd, 2016\n, he got a call from his friend \nBilly\n while driving. His friend gave him potential patients to treat. This conversation caused Strange to get distracted from the road and drive into another car, making him to spin out of control. Having severe nerve damage in his hands, he was picked up by a helicopter and brought back to Metro-General where he then spent months recovering.\nStephen Strange's Apartment\n: Due to being a successful neurosurgeon, Strange was able to buy a very luxurious apartment in New York City overlooking many skyscrapers.\nKamar-Taj\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange studying with \nAncient One\n \n \n With many failures to heal his hands, Strange went to go see \nJonathan Pangborn\n, a former patient with paralysis, Pangborn quickly mentioned how Strange refused to see him for treatment. Strange stated that he was untreatable. He then asked how he was able to heal his broken spine. Pangborn said that he went to a place called Kamar-Taj. After spending the last of his money to get there, Strange met the \nAncient One\n. She taught him that Kamar-Taj was not a normal place, it is the home of sorcerers and magic. She explained how Pangborn uses magic to let himself walk and Strange can do the same. For many months Stephen trained and studied to become a good sorcerer, he quickly made friends with other sorcerers like \nKarl Mordo\n and \nWong\n.\nNew York Sanctum\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrange levitating in the Sanctum\n \n \n The Zealots and \nKaecilius\n attacked the New York Sanctum and killed its master, \nDaniel Drumm\n. Doctor Strange fought off the sanctum alone and trapped Kaecilius for a short time until he was freed by his Zealot. The Ancient One then gave Strange the title Master of the New York Sanctum. In 2018, \nBruce Banner\n suddenly crashed through the roof of the sanctum and exclaimed that \nThanos\n was coming. Doctor Strange and Wong then tracked down \nTony Stark\n and brought him to the sanctum to discuss the new threat that has emerged. Hearing commotion outside, the group took to the streets to stop \nEbony Maw\n's attack on New York. Following the \nBattle of Earth\n, Strange returned to being the master of the Sanctum Sanctorum. While Strange had been a candidate for Sorcerer Supreme before he had been turned to dust\n[\n21\n]\n, Wong had become the Sorcerer Supreme in his absence.\nRelationships\n[\n]\nFamily\n[\n]\nDonna Strange\n  - Sister\nAllies\n[\n]\nMetro-General Hospital\nChristine Palmer\n - Ex-Girlfriend, Former Colleague, Love Interest and Savior\nNicodemus West\n - Former Colleague and Former Rival\nBilly\n - Friend and Former Assistant\nPatel\n - Former Assistant\nGarrison\n - Former Colleague\nWeiss\n - Former Colleague\nBruner\n - Former Colleague\nEtienne\n - Former Colleague\nJonathan Pangborn\nMasters of the Mystic Arts\nAncient One\n  - Former Leader and Predecessor\nWong\n - Mentor, Leader and Best Friend\nHamir\n \nSol Rama\n \nDaniel Drumm\n \nTina Minoru\nGrem\nB'sso\nHong Kong Master\nLondon Master\nSara Wolfe\n \nRintrah\nWeasel\nVinny\nAmerica Chavez\n - Friend\nOdin\n \nAvengers\nSteve Rogers/Captain America\nTony Stark/Iron Man\n  - Savior and Former Rival\nBruce Banner/Hulk\n - Resurrector\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\n - Savior, Former Friend and Temporary Enemy\nWanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch\n  - Temporary Enemy and Former Attempted Killer\nSam Wilson/Falcon\nScott Lang/Ant-Man\nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nClint Barton/Hawkeye\nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\nPepper Potts/Rescue\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\n - Temporary Enemy\nDrax the Destroyer\n - Temporary Enemy\nMantis\n - Temporary Enemy\nNebula\nGroot\nRocket\nThor\nGolden Tribe\nT'Challa/Black Panther\n \nShuri\nDora Milaje\nOkoye\nJabari Tribe\nM'Baku\nBorder Tribe\nWakandan Royal Guard\nBucky Barnes/Winter Soldier\nBrunhilde/Valkyrie\nWarsong\nKorg\nMiek\nEinherjar\nRavagers\nKraglin Obfonteri\nHoward the Duck\nHope van Dyne/Wasp\nGamora\nNed Leeds\nMichelle Jones\nOtto Octavius/Doctor Octopus\n - Former Prisoner and Savior\nFlint Marko/Sandman\n - Former Prisoner\nMax Dillon/Electro\n - Former Prisoner\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\nCharlie\n - Fan\nCarla\nChristine Palmer\n - Friend\nCharles Xavier/Professor X\n \nClea\nEnemies\n[\n]\nHYDRA\nZealots\nKaecilius\n - Attempted Killer\nLucian Aster\n  - Attempted Killer and Victim\nBlonde Zealot\nBrunette Zealot\nTall Zealot\n \nDormammu\n - Killer \n(in the time loops)\nKarl Mordo\n - Former Trainer and Attempted Killer\nLoki\n \nBlack Order\nEbony Maw\n  - Attempted Killer\nCull Obsidian\n \nThanos\n  - Killer\nThanos\n \nBlack Order\nEbony Maw\n \nCull Obsidian\n \nProxima Midnight\n \nCorvus Glaive\n \nChitauri\nLeviathans\nChitauri Gorillas\nOutriders\nSakaarans\nCurt Connors/Lizard\n - Former Prisoner\nNorman Osborn/Green Goblin\n - Former Prisoner and Attempted Killer\nGargantos\n  - Attempted Killer and Victim\nPizza Poppa\nIlluminati\nKarl Mordo/Baron Mordo\n - Former Captor and Attempted Killer\nBlackagar Boltagon/Black Bolt\n \nPeggy Carter/Captain Carter\n \nMaria Rambeau/Captain Marvel\n \nReed Richards/Mister Fantastic\n \nUltron Sentries\nStephen Strange/Doctor Strange\n  - Alternate Self, Attempted Killer and Victim\nDemons\nSouls of the Damned\n - Attempted Killers\nElder Beasts\nAppearances\n[\n]\nAppearances for Doctor Strange\nChronological\nNarrative\nIn chronological order:\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n \n(mentioned;
