Wilson decided to leave active duty when his wingman \nRonald Riley\n was killed in action, instead choosing to help other veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At this time, Wilson met \nSteve Rogers\n and was drawn to his conflict with \nHYDRA\n, as Rogers needed help from anyone not associated with \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n since they had been \ninfiltrated\n by HYDRA. Retaking his old wings, Wilson had then assisted with \ndestroying\n all of \nAlexander Pierce\n's schemes of \nworld domination\n. Following their victory against Pierce's HYDRA units, Falcon then agreed to assist Rogers in tracking down \nWinter Soldier\n, who was in fact Rogers' close friend who had been brainwashed by HYDRA.\nAs Falcon continued searching for the Winter Soldier, he was recruited into the \nAvengers\n. During his time with the Avengers, Falcon briefly \nencountered\n \nAnt-Man\n before assisting in defeating \nCrossbones\n. In the aftermath of several \nincidents\n that caused casualties within civilians, the Avengers were then forced into following the \nSokovia Accords\n, putting them all under the government's full control. However, as the Winter Soldier was blamed for \nterrorist attacks\n by \nHelmut Zemo\n, Falcon stood by Captain America with protecting the Winter Soldier, which had then caused the \nAvengers Civil War\n. In the wake of this \nclash\n, Falcon, and several other Avengers who were loyal to Captain America, were defeated by \nIron Man\n, and locked into the \nRaft\n, until Captain America freed them as they became fugitives.\nWhile the Avengers were still disbanded, \nEarth\n had come under attack by \nThanos\n and his \nBlack Order\n, bringing Falcon and his allies out of hiding. Learning that Thanos intended to steal the \nMind Stone\n from \nVision\n, Falcon joined the Avengers in taking Vision to \nWakanda\n for his protection. However, they were eventually \ndefeated\n as Thanos claimed the \nInfinity Stones\n and used them to cause the \nSnap\n, killing trillions including Falcon. \nFive years later\n, the victims of the Snap were resurrected by the surviving Avengers, and Falcon rejoined the battle against \nThanos\n. In the aftermath of the \nbattle\n, Falcon learned that Captain America returned to the past and had lived a full life with \nPeggy Carter\n, and seeing him return as an old man, was given the \nshield\n by Rogers.\nInitially declining the shield and giving it up to the \nSmithsonian Institution\n under the impression that it would remain a display piece, Wilson was disgusted when the Government had then appointed \nJohn Walker\n as their next Captain America. Wilson instead refocused on fighting the \nFlag Smashers\n, forming an unlikely alliance with \nBucky Barnes\n and \nHelmut Zemo\n to track them down. However, as Walker began to lose control, due to taking the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n, and brutally murdered \none\n of the Flag Smashers, in public, Wilson retook the shield. Following some soul searching and a discussion with \nIsaiah Bradley\n, Wilson had finally taken up the mantle of \nCaptain America\n in time to intervene with the Flag Smashers' attack on the \nGRC\n, stopping \nKarli Morgenthau\n, as he convinced the GRC to treat refugee communities created by the \nBlip\n fairly, inspiring a new generation of heroes.\nThree years later\n, Wilson, now working with the government, was invited to the \nCelestial Island World Summit\n at the \nWhite House\n by newly elected U.S. President \nThaddeus Ross\n. Wilson was wrapped up in a nefarious plot when \nIsaiah Bradley\n was mind-controlled to \nattack\n Ross and tensions continued to rise as an arms race between \nJapan\n and the \nUnited States\n began over the use of \nadamantium\n. Wilson, along with his partner \nJoaqun Torres\n discovered the conspiracy was set in place by \nSamuel Sterns\n, as a way to destroy Ross' legacy, and were unable to stop his plans from coming to fruition when Ross turned into the \nRed Hulk\n at a press conference and had gone on a rampage. Wilson \nbattled\n against Ross and got him to calm down, after which, Ross chose to turn himself in and was imprisoned in the \nRaft\n.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nWilson Family Seafood\n1.2\n \nMilitary Career\n1.2.1\n \nServing Two Tours\n1.2.2\n \nLosing Riley\n1.3\n \nMeeting Captain America\n1.3.1\n \nSurprise Running Companion\n1.3.2\n \nAdvising Steve Rogers\n1.3.3\n \nHelping the Fugitives\n1.3.4\n \nKidnapping Agent Sitwell\n1.3.5\n \nEncountering Winter Soldier\n1.3.6\n \nMeeting Nick Fury\n1.3.7\n \nBattle at the Triskelion\n1.3.8\n \nFacing Brock Rumlow\n1.4\n \nNew Avengers\n1.4.1\n \nSearch for Bucky Barnes\n1.4.2\n \nAvengers Party\n1.4.3\n \nJoining the Avengers\n1.4.4\n \nAttack of Ultimo\n1.4.5\n \nDuel at the Avengers Compound\n1.4.6\n \nSearch for Ant-Man\n1.4.7\n \nAttack in Lagos\n1.5\n \nAvengers Civil War\n1.5.1\n \nSokovia Accords\n1.5.2\n \nPeggy Carter's Funeral\n1.5.3\n \nFinding Bucky Barnes\n1.5.4\n \nHeld by Everett Ross\n1.5.5\n \nWinter Soldier's Escape\n1.5.6\n \nGoing on the Run\n1.5.7\n \nBuilding the Team\n1.5.8\n \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n1.5.9\n \nWinning a Losing Battle\n1.5.10\n \nImprisoned in the Raft\n1.6\n \nOn the Run\n1.6.1\n \nFighting the Needle\n1.6.2\n \nInfiltrating Terrorists\n1.7\n \nInfinity War\n1.7.1\n \nRescuing Vision\n1.7.2\n \nReunited with Friends\n1.7.3\n \nArriving in Wakanda\n1.7.4\n \nBattle of Wakanda\n1.7.5\n \nThanos' Victory\n1.7.6\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.7.7\n \nReceiving the Shield\n1.8\n \nReturn to the Military\n1.8.1\n \nRescue of Captain Vassant\n1.8.2\n \nLearning of the Flag Smashers\n1.8.3\n \nDonating the Shield\n1.8.4\n \nReturning Home\n1.9\n \nChasing Super Soldiers\n1.9.1\n \nReunion with Bucky Barnes\n1.9.2\n \nChase of the Flag Smashers\n1.9.3\n \nIntroduced to John Walker\n1.9.4\n \nMeeting Isaiah Bradley\n1.9.5\n \nSession with Bucky Barnes\n1.9.6\n \nFreeing Helmut Zemo\n1.9.7\n \nUndercover in Madripoor\n1.9.8\n \nDeal with Sharon Carter\n1.9.9\n \nAmbush at Buccaneer Bay\n1.9.10\n \nJourney to Latvia\n1.9.11\n \nSearch for Donya Madani\n1.9.12\n \nTalks of Peace\n1.9.13\n \nSkirmish with the Dora Milaje\n1.9.14\n \nFlag Smasher Ambush\n1.9.15\n \nBattle for the Shield\n1.9.16\n \nPassing the Mantle\n1.10\n \nTough Decisions\n1.10.1\n \nReunion with Isaiah Bradley\n1.10.2\n \nTime With Family\n1.10.3\n \nTraining with Bucky Barnes\n1.10.4\n \nAccepting the Mantle\n1.11\n \nBecoming Captain America\n1.11.1\n \nSaving the GRC Members\n1.11.2\n \nFinal Fight with Flag Smashers\n1.11.3\n \nPublic Message\n1.11.4\n \nIsaiah Bradley's Legacy\n1.11.5\n \nLouisiana Cookout\n1.11.6\n \nReviewing Scott Lang's Book\n1.12\n \nFighting SERPENT\n1.12.1\n \nTheft of the Solar-Battery Drones\n1.12.2\n \nSkirmish at Catedral de Santo Ramos\n1.12.3\n \nTraining with Isaiah Bradley\n1.13\n \nRuination of Thaddeus Ross' Legacy\n1.13.1\n \nPresident Ross' Proposal\n1.13.2\n \nCelestial Island World Summit\n1.13.3\n \nQuestioning Isaiah Bradley\n1.13.4\n \nAttacked by Sidewinder\n1.13.5\n \nGoing Rogue\n1.13.6\n \nInfiltration into Camp Echo One\n1.13.7\n \nInterrogating Sidewinder\n1.13.8\n \nConfronting President Ross\n1.13.9\n \nBattle of Celestial Island\n1.13.10\n \nDoubting Himself\n1.13.11\n \nDuel of Washington, D.C.\n1.13.12\n \nIsaiah Bradley's Release\n1.13.13\n \nVisiting Thaddeus Ross\n1.14\n \nReassembling the Avengers\n1.14.1\n \nChecking on Joaqun Torres\n1.14.2\n \nLeader's Warning\n1.14.3\n \nTrademark Dispute\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nWeapons\n4.2\n \nOther Equipment\n4.3\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nFacilities\n5.1\n \nPrisons\n6\n \nRelationships\n6.1\n \nFamily\n6.2\n \nAllies\n6.3\n \nEnemies\n7\n \nAppearances\n8\n \nTrivia\n9\n \nBehind the Scenes\n10\n \nReferences\n11\n \nExternal Links\nQuick Answers\nWho is Captain America?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCaptain America, a.k.a.

For an abridged overview, see \nMarvel Database's article on the same character\n.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nWilson Family Seafood\n[\n]\n\"We made a deal before \nDaddy\n died. You're out there. I do things my way here.\"\n\nSarah Wilson\n to Sam Wilson\n[src]\nSam Wilson was born on \nSeptember 23, 1978\n in \nHarlem\n[\n7\n]\n to \nPaul\n and \nDarlene Wilson\n. He was raised in \nLouisiana\n,\n[\n12\n]\n and his parents later had another child, Sam's sister, \nSarah\n.\n[\n13\n]\n Sam's father would often take him to go fishing at a spot in Grand Isle, making Sam very fond of their \nboat\n.\n[\n14\n]\n Sam had an aunt, whom he referred to as his TT, whom he was very close to. When his aunt passed away, Sam attended her funeral, which was well attended and continued for many days, celebrating her life.\n[\n15\n]\n Paul and Darlene were very helpful people, earning many favors from neighbors, who helped them with their \nfamily business\n.\n[\n14\n]\n However, Paul and Darlene both died, leading to Sam joining the military and Sarah working on the business in \nDelacroix\n.\n[\n16\n]\nMilitary Career\n[\n]\nServing Two Tours\n[\n]\n\"When I was over there, I'd sleep on the ground, use rock for the pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like\"\n\"Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nSam Wilson joined the \nUnited States Air Force\n after qualifying and passing all the requirements for pararescue. He served two combat tours in the \nWar on Terrorism\n, being sent out to \nAfghanistan\n during his service. Assigned onto the 58th Rescue Squadron, Wilson was a test pilot for the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n along with his wingman, \nRonald Riley\n. During his time serving in the Air Force, Wilson often found that he would be the most comfortable when he was sleeping on the ground while using rocks as pillows, since there were few other options.\n[\n2\n]\nLosing Riley\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson beside his wingman \nRonald Riley\n \n \n\"You lose someone?\"\n\"My wingman, \nRiley\n. Flying a night mission, standard PJ rescue op. Nothing we hadn't done a thousand times before. 'Til an RPG knocked Riley's dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. Like I was up there just to watch.\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nOne of Wilson's missions involved successfully capturing \nKhalid Khandil\n in \nBakhmala\n, \nAfghanistan\n, being once again teamed up with \nRonald Riley\n. However, during a night rescue mission, Riley was killed after his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n was hit by an RPG and Wilson could do nothing to save him. Having lost his close friend, Wilson had a hard time finding a reason to continue serving and soon left the \nAir Force\n, deciding to focus his efforts on helping veterans recovering from combat \nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n back home, creating the \nDistrict of Columbia Support Group\n to do whatever he could to help.\n[\n2\n]\nMeeting Captain America\n[\n]\nSurprise Running Companion\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson attempting to outrun \nSteve Rogers\n \n \n\"Alright, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that's what you wanna call 'running'.\"\n\"Oh, that's how it is?\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nHaving returned home from the \nUnited States Air Force\n, Wilson was hired by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n, with the intention of counseling the veterans who had been suffering from \nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n. While out for his morning jog across \nWashington, D.C.\n, Wilson soon found his early morning exercise being interrupted by \nSteve Rogers\n, who had managed to casually run by Wilson several times, teasing him as he went, much to Wilson's annoyance.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson attempting to catch his breath back\n \n \nWith Rogers having run past him multiple times throughout their jog, Wilson eventually stopped to catch his breath as Rogers came over to rejoin him. Commenting on how fast he had run, Wilson jokingly challenged Rogers to run another lap, questioning if he could do it in the blink of an eye. Rogers had then questioned what branch of the Air Force Wilson was a part of, and Wilson explained his situation before introducing himself as Rogers helped him back onto his feet.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson introduces himself to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nAs Rogers introduced himself, Wilson had then made it clear that he already knew who he was based upon his incredible running abilities. He then questioned what it was like for Rogers to have been woken up in \n2011\n after living in the \n1940s\n during \nWorld War II\n, to which Rogers only claimed that it was taking some getting used to. Before Rogers could walk away, Wilson had then noted that most other Armed Forces veterans, himself included, had struggled to get used to sleeping on a comfortable bed upon returning home, which Rogers related to. The pair then bonded about their experiences while serving in the military and similarities in readjusting without a war zone.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nSteve Rogers\n discuss their lives\n \n \nOnce Wilson asked Rogers about the differences between living now compared to the 1940s, he listened to Rogers explain why it was not so bad, commenting on all the improvements with their food and technology in the modern day, including the internet. Hearing that Rogers was still trying to catch up on everything that he missed, Wilson then recommended \nMarvin Gaye\n for him to listen to, and Rogers added it to his \nTo-Do List\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson first encounters \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \nThe conversation was cut short, however, as Rogers was called away on a \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n mission by \nNatasha Romanoff\n. Wilson encouraged Rogers to visit him at the \nVA\n someday, ostensibly so Wilson could impress the women who also worked there, while Rogers teased him over his jogging abilities. As Romanoff had arrived to collect Rogers in her car, joking that they would put him in the \nSmithsonian\n as an exhibit, Wilson gave her a flirtatious greeting before watching her drive away with Rogers.\n[\n2\n]\nAdvising Steve Rogers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson giving his speech to former soldiers\n \n \n\"The number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell yeah. Are you thinking about getting out?\"\n\"No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nWilson held a \ngroup session\n with \nArmed Forces\n veterans who were suffering from \nPTSD\n as he helped \nGarcia\n, who was struggling with visions of IEDs in the roads. Once Garcia had finished her confessions, Wilson spoke to the group about what they kept with them from their experiences with war and what they left behind. He used a metaphor of carrying the memories in a bag as he offered advice in separating their time in the military from their time being at home, where they were trying to relive as civilians.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson talking about \nRonald Riley\n to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWith their meeting over, Wilson once again met with \nSteve Rogers\n, who complimented him on his insights to Garcia, having arrived to listen to the last few minutes of his meeting. Wilson then told Rogers about his time in \nAfghanistan\n and how he lost his friend, \nRonald Riley\n, during a mission. Wilson explained that once Riley died, he had lost his own passion for serving in the military but found a new purpose in his life by helping these veterans readjust after returning to their homes.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson giving \nSteve Rogers\n some life advice\n \n \nRogers admitted to Wilson that he was struggling with the idea of what to do with himself if he was not a soldier, since he also didn't know how to leave \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and just live a normal life, to which Wilson jokingly suggested that he could join \nUltimate Fighting\n due to his \nSuper Soldier Serum\n. However, Wilson got serious once again as he then assured Rogers that he could do whatever he wanted, before questioning what it was that actually made him happy in life.\n[\n2\n]\nHelping the Fugitives\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson agrees to help \nRogers\n and \nRomanoff\n \n \n\"I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.\"\n\"Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nHaving returned to his \napartment\n after jogging through \nWashington, D.C.\n, Wilson heard a knock at his door and was surprised to find a disheveled \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who had come seeking refuge as they claimed that everybody they knew was currently attempting to kill them. Despite having little context to their current situation, Wilson offered them both help without a second thought, opening his door for Rogers and Romanoff to come inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson offering breakfast to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWhile they were inside his home, Wilson made the pair breakfast and allowed them to use his shower in order to clean themselves up, as they had been involved in an explosion at \nCamp Lehigh\n. Despite his own choice to leave the \nUnited States Air Force\n, Wilson had felt that being called upon by \nCaptain America\n simply meant he had to return. Having finished making breakfast, Wilson came upstairs as he informed Rogers and Romanoff that it was ready if they wanted it.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learning about \nAlexander Pierce\n \n \nAs the group ate together, Wilson learned of the full details of Rogers' and Romanoff's current predicament, as he was informed about how \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n had been infiltrated by \nHYDRA\n for decades, resulting in them being betrayed by \nAlexander Pierce\n, who had ordered the \nassassination\n of themselves as well as Director \nNick Fury\n. Having learned how dangerous their situation was if Pierce succeeded in his plans with \nProject Insight\n, Wilson had then offered his assistance.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson showing \nSteve Rogers\n what he flies\n \n \nAlthough Rogers was reluctant to accept, Wilson had insisted before then revealing to them that he was part of a \nmilitary project\n that used the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, with Romanoff recognizing their unit as the one that captured \nKhalid Khandil\n in \nAfghanistan\n. Rogers had also noticed a picture of Wilson and \nRonald Riley\n. Seeing that Wilson could be beneficial to the mission to capture and question \nJasper Sitwell\n, Rogers accepted his help as they all agreed to steal the EXO-7 Falcon together.\n[\n2\n]\nKidnapping Agent Sitwell\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson calmly threatening \nJasper Sitwell\n \n \n\"You're gonna go around the corner to your right. There's a gray car two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.\"\n\"And why would I do that?\"\n\"Because that tie looks really expensive, I'd hate to mess it up.\"\nSam Wilson and \nJasper Sitwell\n[src]\nHaving retrieved the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n from \nFort Meade\n, Wilson traveled with both \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n to find and interrogate \nJasper Sitwell\n. Wilson called Sitwell on the phone after he had a meeting with Senator \nStern\n and threatened to have him shot if he did not do exactly as instructed; he ordered Sitwell to go into a car that drove him to a nearby building to be questioned by Rogers and Romanoff on the roof.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon drops \nJasper Sitwell\n onto the roof\n \n \nDuring his initial interrogation by Rogers, Sitwell denied any knowledge of \nHYDRA\n's \ntakeover\n of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n As they grew tired of his lies, Romanoff had instead resorted to kicking Sitwell off the building, in order to scare him into finally giving the answers they needed. After Sitwell fell several stories, Falcon then flew in at the last moment, caught him in mid-air, and brought Sitwell back onto the top of the building, dropping him with some force on the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon listens to \nJasper Sitwell\n confessing\n \n \nAs Falcon retracted his wings and rejoined Rogers and Romanoff, he watched as Sitwell confessed, since the fall scared him so much. Falcon listened while Sitwell revealed how \nArnim Zola\n's \nalgorithm\n was in fact their plan to locate any potential threats to HYDRA in the future, and that \nAlexander Pierce\n intended to use \nProject Insight\n in order to assassinate these people of interest the moment the Insight \nHelicarriers\n were launched.\n[\n2\n]\nEncountering Winter Soldier\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson orders \nJasper Sitwell\n to remain quiet\n \n \n\"Go! I got this!\"\nSam Wilson to \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nHaving learned of \nAlexander Pierce\n's sinister plans of the worldwide massacre, Wilson drove \nJasper Sitwell\n towards the \nTriskelion\n, where they planned to use his clearances to gain access to, and shut down \nProject Insight\n before Pierce could activate it. Sitwell, however, insisted that this concept was a terrible idea, but Wilson ordered that he keep quiet while they were driving there as \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n then continued to discuss the fine details of their new plan.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson witnesses the \nWinter Soldier\n's attack\n \n \nHowever, before the group could get to the Triskelion, someone suddenly landed on their roof as a \nrobotic arm\n ripped Sitwell out of the window and into the path of a speeding truck, killing him. As the attacker began shooting into the car, Wilson slammed on the breaks, launching him off the vehicle, and they were faced with the \nWinter Soldier\n. Before the group could react, another vehicle had slammed into the back of their car, which drove Wilson and the others towards Winter Soldier.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and his allies escape their vehicle\n \n \nWith Wilson unable to do anything, Winter Soldier proceeded to rip the steering wheel out of his hands in an attempt to cause a fatal crash. While the car spun out of control, Rogers then grabbed Wilson and Romanoff and threw them all out, using his \nshield\n to protect them as they skidded on the road at high speed. When they recovered from the crash, a \nfight\n then erupted in the streets, in which Wilson dove for cover while Rogers was knocked off the bridge by a grenade.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson battles against \nHYDRA\n soldiers\n \n \nOnce Romanoff was also thrown off the bridge because of Winter Soldier's grenade launcher, Wilson had managed to remain hidden as the \nHYDRA\n mercenaries then began repelling off the bridge in order to continue the fight, shooting at Rogers with a mini-gun. Surprising one mercenary, Wilson was able to knock him off the bridge and take his gun, using it to give Rogers covering fire. Wilson then instructed Rogers to help keep Winter Soldier away from Romanoff.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon knocks down \nWinter Soldier\n \n \nEventually, Wilson had managed to defeat the unit of HYDRA soldiers from the bridge and then went in search of Rogers and Romanoff on the streets of \nWashington, D.C.\n, taking his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n with him as protection. Before long, Falcon discovered Rogers battling Winter Soldier and flew in to assist, coming in just as their fight had briefly paused due to a moment's confusion. Falcon was able to kick Winter Soldier aside just before he could shoot Rogers.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is captured by \nBrock Rumlow\n's men\n \n \nWhile Falcon had landed on the streets, Winter Soldier recovered from the assault and had attempted to shoot at Rogers again, only for Romanoff to then shoot a grenade launcher at him, which caused him to flee. Before they could get away, however, Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson were then surrounded and captured by some of HYDRA's infiltrators within \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, led by \nBrock Rumlow\n. As Wilson was pinned against the car at gunpoint, he had his Exo-7 Falcon removed while Rumlow and \nJack Rollins\n secured Rogers. The three of them were put in the back of a van to be executed later, with Romanoff wounded from being shot at by the Winter Soldier earlier.\n[\n2\n]\nMeeting Nick Fury\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is transported to a secret location\n \n \n\"Look, whoever \nhe\n used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.\"\n\"I don't know if I can do that.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nUnder the watchful eyes of \nHYDRA\n's soldiers, Wilson and the others were transported towards a secret location where \nBrock Rumlow\n intended to have them all killed. During their journey, \nSteve Rogers\n explained that \nWinter Soldier\n was in fact his friend, \nBucky Barnes\n, who seemingly died in \nWorld War II\n. Wilson wondered how this could be possible, and Rogers explained that \nArnim Zola\n had experimented on Barnes, which helped him to survive his apparent \ndeath\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is saved by \nMaria Hill\n \n \nAs they drove along, Wilson noticed that \nNatasha Romanoff\n was currently losing a lot of blood from her injury and warned the guards that she needed a doctor or else she would bleed out. However, much to Wilson's great surprise, one of the HYDRA guards then used a \nTaser Rod\n to attack the other guard and knock him unconscious, before she revealed herself to really be \nMaria Hill\n. While Hill had questioned who Wilson was, she used the \nMouse Hole\n to escape with the three before Rumlow even noticed.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learns that \nNick Fury\n is actually alive\n \n \nHaving gotten away from their HYDRA kidnappers, Hill then brought them inside the \nS.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility\n where Romanoff was finally given medical attention from Doctor \nFine\n. While Romanoff's gunshot wound was being treated, Hill revealed to Wilson and the others that Director \nNick Fury\n was also there, still recuperating from the recent \nassassination attempt\n orchestrated by Winter Soldier, with nobody, other than them, currently being aware of his survival.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is introduced to Director \nNick Fury\n \n \nWilson listened as Fury and Fine discussed the list of injuries Fury had sustained when he was attacked by Winter Soldier. Fury explained that he used \nTetrodotoxin B\n, which had been developed by \nBruce Banner\n, to slow his heartbeat down to the point that it appeared that he had died. When Rogers questioned why he had kept this as a secret, Hill noted that their enemies needed to believe that Fury was dead in order to ensure that any second assassination attempt was not made. While the others remained unsure about the situation, Wilson listened as Fury continued explaining that he had been unsure who he could actually trust since \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n was compromised.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and the others discuss their plan\n \n \nWilson rejoined the team while together, they focused on their work to stop HYDRA's plans as Fury discussed \nAlexander Pierce\n's betrayal and how they could not contact the \nWorld Security Council\n to stop the launch of \nProject Insight\n. As Fury revealed three microchips, Wilson asked what they were, to which Hill explained that they would use these chips to hack into the \nHelicarriers\n directly and cause them to target each other, warning that millions would die if they failed.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson insists he will stand with \nRogers\n \n \nWhen Rogers told Fury that he intended to destroy not only the Project Insight Helicarriers, but all of S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, Fury protested, insisting that HYDRA had tricked them all and S.H.I.E.L.D. was innocent. Despite his protests, Hill and Romanoff agreed with Rogers, to which Wilson affirmed that he was also standing with his friend, joking that he would go where Rogers went, only slower. With that, Fury finally relented and gave Rogers control over their mission.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and Rogers discussing \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nKnowing that their plans to defeat Pierce would undoubtedly be met with the full forces of HYDRA, Wilson later talked with Rogers about what they should do once they encountered the Winter Soldier again. Wilson insisted to Rogers that Barnes was the kind of guy you have to stop rather than save in spite of their friendship in \nWorld War II\n. However, Rogers remained convinced he could save Barnes, as he then proclaimed that he would find his \nuniform\n to fight their upcoming battle against HYDRA.\n[\n2\n]\nBattle at the Triskelion\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon helps to take over the control room\n \n \n\"Cap, how do we know the \ngood guys\n from the \nbad guys\n?\"\n\"If they're shooting at you, they're bad.\"\nFalcon and \nCaptain America\n[src]\nHaving assisted in stealing \nCaptain America\n's \nUniform\n from the \nSmithsonian\n exhibit, Falcon joined him and \nMaria Hill\n as they broke into the \nTriskelion\n and secured the control room, taking \nMoore\n and the other controllers captive. Once they all had taken full control of the situation, Captain America informed every \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agent of \nHYDRA\n's \ninfiltration\n into their organization as well as \nAlexander Pierce\n's true plans for \nProject Insight\n, asking them to trust his word.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon compliments \nSteve Rogers\n' speech\n \n \nFalcon listened as Captain America told the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that while many had been ordered to \nhunt him down\n by \nSTRIKE\n teams, he urged them to stand against the enemy before Pierce was able to succeed with launching \nProject Insight\n, revealing that they already killed \nNick Fury\n to ensure their plan went ahead. Once he had finished, Falcon jokingly asked Captain America if he had practiced the speech beforehand, or simply made it up as he went along.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon and \nCaptain America\n run into battle\n \n \nWith the Project Insight \nHelicarriers\n now launching and the few remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being led by \nSharon Carter\n in their fight against HYDRA, Falcon and Captain America charged outside to destroy these Helicarriers. As they jogged forward, Falcon questioned how they would be able to tell the good guys from the bad guys, but Captain America just calmly reminded Falcon that only the bad guys would be attempting to \nshoot him\n out of the sky.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon avoids all of the \nHelicarrier\n's gunfire\n \n \nOn that note, Captain America jumped off the platform onto the rising Helicarrier while Falcon activated his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n and took off. As Falcon flew in line with the Helicarriers, he immediately found himself being targeted and attempted to avoid the gunfire by using his advanced flying techniques. Hill asked Falcon for an update on his status, and he informed her that he was engaging the enemy as he flew directly into the line of fire, swiftly diving through the air to avoid all the Helicarrier's shots.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon shoots down several \nHYDRA\n guards\n \n \nDiving onto the deck of a Helicarrier, Falcon had managed to surprise one HYDRA guard by crashing directly into him, before then spinning around as he armed himself with his \nhandguns\n and shooting down a second guard. However, before Falcon could sneak on board the Helicarrier to plant their microchip, he then suddenly came under attack from a \nQuinjet\n, which chased him across the deck while shooting at him. Falcon used the parked Quinjets to take cover.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon gets targeted by an enemy \nQuinjet\n \n \nSuddenly, the Quinjet fired a missile at Falcon, barely missing him and destroying a parked Quinjet he was flying by. The explosion knocked Falcon to the ground, as the Quinjet came out of the smoke and attempted to shoot him down. However, Falcon swiftly recovered as he then dived backwards off the Helicarrier, shooting his twin guns at the HYDRA pilots before reactivating his EXO-7 Falcon and flying away, with the Quinjet still chasing him down and shooting at him.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is chased by the \nQuinjet\n \n \nWhile Captain America successfully inserted the first microchip in one of the Helicarriers, Falcon continued to desperately try and get away from the Quinjet that was still pursuing him. While Falcon flew on the underbelly of the Helicarrier, the Quinjet had fired dozens of missiles at him. Falcon used all of his maneuvering abilities to avoid them, retracting his wings and allowing himself to fall as all of the missiles then smashed into the side of the Helicarrier.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon gets in the \nHelicarrier\n \n \nWith the Quinjet pilots mistakenly thinking they had just killed Falcon in the explosion, he was able to use the hole in the underbelly of the Helicarrier, which was caused by the missiles, to get inside and access the control systems to insert their second microchip, granting Hill control over two out of the three Helicarriers. With that portion of their mission completed, Falcon then dove back outside in order to board the final Helicarrier and destroy Project Insight.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon rescues \nCaptain America\n \n \nBefore Falcon could head onto the third Helicarrier, he was contacted by Captain America, who requested a ride since he was under attack from several HYDRA agents. Falcon then witnessed Captain America dive off the second Helicarrier, falling hundreds of feet to the ground below. Falcon flew after him at full speed, managing to catch Captain America in the air and fly him to the final Helicarrier. He had also jokingly commented that Captain America was a lot heavier than he looked.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon attempts to shoot the \nWinter Soldier\n \n \nHowever, just as Falcon and Captain America shared some humor, they were ambushed by \nWinter Soldier\n, who charged forward and threw Captain America from the Helicarrier. Fearing his friend was falling to his death, Falcon attempted to save Captain America, only for Winter Soldier to grab one of his wings and thrown him backwards to continue their fight. Falcon then drew his twin guns and shot at Winter Soldier, who was able to avoid the bullets and take cover.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is kicked over by \nWinter Soldier\n \n \nAs Falcon had then tried once again to rescue Captain America from falling, he flew upwards, only for Winter Soldier to use his grappling wire to grab ahold of Falcon's wing and pull him back down to the ground, before tearing one of the wings off the EXO-7 Falcon. As Falcon then attempted to get back on his feet, Winter Soldier charged forward and kicked him off the Helicarrier, with Falcon plummeting towards the ground below with his now badly damaged wing suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon lands onto the ground without injury\n \n \nAs Falcon fell hundreds of feet below, he was then able to cut the second wing free before activating his parachute, allowing him to land safely in the Triskelion. Falcon confirmed that Captain America was alive and still on board the Helicarrier, as he had gone to continue their mission alone. Falcon was warned by Hill that \nBrock Rumlow\n was now on his way to the \nWorld Security Council\n in order to then intercept \nBlack Widow\n, so he went to keep Rumlow away from the group.\n[\n2\n]\nFacing Brock Rumlow\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson ready to fight against \nBrock Rumlow\n \n \n\"There are no prisoners with \nHYDRA\n, just order, and order only comes through pain.

Wilson hid behind the door and ambushed Rumlow, striking him in the face and attempting to knock him out with a knee to the head.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson fights against \nBrock Rumlow\n \n \nHowever, Rumlow quickly proved himself to be a formidable fighter as he blocked Wilson's knee and head-butted him with some force, knocking Wilson onto the ground. While Wilson slowly got back onto his feet, Rumlow had removed his jacket and \nBulletproof Vest\n as he then proclaimed to Wilson that his punishment for trying to go against \nHYDRA\n would now cause him considerable pain, since that was the only way HYDRA believed the world could regain order.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is overpowered by \nBrock Rumlow\n \n \nAs Rumlow continued to rant about HYDRA's schemes, Wilson readied himself for a fight and simply told his rival to shut up, so they could. The two soldiers charged towards each other for an intense fight in hand-to-hand combat. As their battle reached its conclusion, Rumlow managed to gain the upper hand, using all of his own slightly refined combat techniques to overpower Wilson before throwing him across the room. Rumlow then began taunting him by standing over the injured Wilson.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson desperately running for his life\n \n \nBefore Rumlow was able to finish him off, claiming that Wilson was out of his depth, their battle was cut short; Wilson spotted the final \nProject Insight\n \nHelicarrier\n heading straight towards the \nTriskelion\n behind the overconfident Rumlow, having been successfully reprogrammed and destroyed in the battle. Using his head start to his advantage, Wilson ran for his life as the Helicarrier crashed into the building, with Rumlow being buried under the debris.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson leaps out of the window just in time\n \n \nWith only moments to spare, Wilson then contacted \nBlack Widow\n as he demanded she bring the \nHelicopter\n to him. Wilson was forced to jump from the 41st floor of the building, where he was then caught by a Helicopter piloted by \nNick Fury\n and Black Widow. Although Wilson had berated the pair for almost killing him with the helicopter blades, they soon turned their attention to escaping the explosions, and locating \nCaptain America\n, who was on board the Helicarrier.\n[\n2\n]\nNew Avengers\n[\n]\nSearch for Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson waits by \nSteve Rogers\n' hospital bed\n \n \n\"You're going after \nhim\n.\"\n\"You don't have to come with me.\"\n\"I know.

Wilson stayed beside Rogers' bed until he recovered, and played the \nMarvin Gaye\n music he had previously recommended to him. As Rogers awakened, the first words he said to Wilson were \"on your left\", causing Wilson to smile in relief and amusement.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson refuses to go with Director \nNick Fury\n \n \nWith much of \nHYDRA\n's leadership either arrested or gone into hiding, Wilson and Rogers then went to the fake gravesite for \nNick Fury\n, and were met by him. Wilson greeted \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's former leader, who then explained that he would be traveling to \nEurope\n to seek out the surviving members of HYDRA.

Wilson and Rogers had later talked about their battle against Baron Strucker's forces, as Wilson jokingly wanted to know why he had not been invited to assist in the fight as he had been helping Rogers in their search for \nBucky Barnes\n for the last few months before Rogers had been called by the Avengers.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discusses him joining the \nAvengers\n \n \nWhen Rogers had attempted to apologize that Falcon had not been invited to their fight against Baron Strucker, Wilson had still assured Rogers that he was not massively interested in joining the Avengers at that point, claiming that the Avengers were crazy.

In the wake of \nClint Barton\n's decision to retire and \nTony Stark\n's demotion to the non-combatant, and the departure of \nThor\n, Falcon was recruited into the \nAvengers\n' newest roster alongside their other allies who had proved themselves worthy members, including \nWar Machine\n, \nVision\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon looks at \nCaptain America\n \n \nFalcon had then arrived at the \nAvengers Compound\n with his newest version of his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, complete with the upgraded mechanical wings that were more combat ready, having been upgraded by Stark.

Flying onto the roof, Falcon then spotted a \nman\n wearing a \nsuit\n that seemed to make him the size of an \nant\n. Once it was made clear that Falcon could see this man despite his size, the man regrew and introduced himself as Scott with the code-name Ant-Man, noting that he was a big fan of the \nAvengers\n, which Falcon appreciated but remained serious about their situation.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon fights against \nAnt-Man\n \n \nFalcon demanded to know why \nAnt-Man\n was at the facility; the man claimed to simply be needing to borrow the \nSignal Decoy\n from them which he intended to use to \nsave their world\n, noting that Falcon and all the Avengers should understand what that was like. Believing that Ant-Man was a sort of spy, Falcon attempted to arrest him and bring him inside for question, only for Ant-Man to shrink and punch Falcon with a surprising amount of force, resulting with the pair beginning to fight and being knocked from the facility's rooftop, where Falcon had then drawn his \ntwin guns\n and attempted to shoot the intruder.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon's \nflight suit\n is sabotaged by \nAnt-Man\n \n \nDuring the battle, Falcon had learned that despite his small size, Ant-Man was a formidable opponent as he was only just able to keep up with him as Ant-Man used his powers of shrinking to remain almost undetectable. Falcon used his \nCombat Goggles\n to track him down and deliver punches that forced Ant-Man to regrow. When Ant-Man managed to get away from the Avenger and flew inside the facility on the back of an ant, Falcon followed Ant-Man into the Facility until he had managed to shrink down and disable the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n from the inside, dropping him onto the floor before escaping the Avenger.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon informs of his defeat from \nAnt-Man\n \n \nFalcon hit the ground hard and, by the time he then recovered from that impact, with his suit damaged, Falcon was unable to track Ant-Man who already escaped with the Signal Decoy.

Seeking another hero who could potentially assist the \nAvengers\n in their missions, and having heard of Ant-Man using his own abilities to stop the sale of a new super-weapon called the \nYellowjacket Suit\n which was almost handed over to HYDRA by \nDarren Cross\n, Wilson began seeking out Ant-Man, despite only knowing his first name was Scott.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson getting a lead on \nAnt-Man\n's location\n \n \nEventually, Wilson had encountered the \nWriter\n who had connections with many underground heroes with unusual abilities, including \none\n who could crawl up the walls. Wilson asked the writer whether or not she knew of any newer heroes using \ntechnology\n that allowed him to shrink and if she knew how he would be able to get into contact with him. This led her to tracking Ant-Man down by meeting \nIgnacio\n, who put her into contact with his cousin \nLuis\n, a close friend of a friend of Ant-Man who agreed to help him, as Wilson had told the writer to tell Ignacio to tell Luis that he was currently looking for Ant-Man.\n[\n19\n]\nAttack in Lagos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon looks out for \nCrossbones\n' attack\n \n \n\"Eyes on target, \nfolks\n.

Wilson sat with the rest of the team as Ross told them how, following a massive heart attack, he had gained a whole new perspective over the world, noting how the world had owed the \nAvengers\n an unpayable debt, but he viewed them as dangerous vigilantes, commenting on how they were enhanced individuals who seemed to have little regard for the destruction they left behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learns about the \nSokovia Accords\n \n \nRoss demonstrated his point by showing the high civilian death tolls connected with the Avengers' missions in \nNew York City\n and \nSokovia\n while they fought against \nLoki\n and \nUltron\n, with their recent disaster in \nLagos\n during their fight against \nCrossbones\n, it had been decided that they needed to be put under closer checks. Ross presented Wilson with the recently written \nSokovia Accords\n, which Ross had explained meant the \nUnited Nations\n would have control over the Avengers.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson debates with \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nOnce Ross had left the \nAvengers Compound\n, Wilson and the other Avengers began discussing the Accords and whether they should be accepted, as he spoke to \nJames Rhodes\n who was arguing that Ross' military record should give him more credibility. While Wilson argued that there was a risk they would be sent to the \nRaft\n if they disobeyed the Accords, to which Rhodes then noted that with the support of the hundred and seventeen countries, the Accords should be obeyed.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson listening to the \nAvengers\n' arguments\n \n \nThe debate was interrupted by \nVision\n who proposed an equation, as Wilson mocked this. Wilson listened while Vision made the point that following \nTony Stark\n announcing that he was \nIron Man\n, the number of enhanced individuals and world threatening events had skyrocketed, claiming that the Avengers' presence would always invite challenges. While Rhodes had believed all this supported his arguments, \nNatasha Romanoff\n invited \nTony Stark\n to make his own case for the Accords.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson listens to \nTony Stark\n's arguments\n \n \nWilson listened while Stark had told them about \nCharlie Spencer\n and how he was killed in Sokovia while they had fought Ultron. Stark told the Avengers that they had needed to be put in check, ensuring that people like Spencer did not lose their lives, as Wilson listened while Stark and \nSteve Rogers\n debated the potential ramifications from this and if they could be forced into it, with \nWanda Maximoff\n fearing that their governments could potentially attempt to arrest her for her actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson questions \nBlack Widow\n's choice\n \n \nTo the great surprise of Wilson, Romanoff also spoke out about her support for the Accords, as Wilson reminded her about how she had turned against the \nDepartment of Defense\n in the wake of the \nHYDRA Uprising\n. As Stark claimed that he won the debate, Wilson then saw Rogers getting the message that \nPeggy Carter\n had died.\n[\n21\n]\n Wilson's decision to not sign the Accords had then resulted with him receiving an honorable discharge from the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n.\n[\n22\n]\nPeggy Carter's Funeral\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson attends the funeral of \nPeggy Carter\n \n \n\"Here's to an honorable discharge.\"\n\"Sure you're okay with this?\"\n\"Ah, I'm not worried about me, I'll make a great civilian.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nWilson had accompanied \nSteve Rogers\n for \nPeggy Carter\n's funeral in the \nUnited Kingdom\n. As they had taken their seats, Wilson had then noticed that \nSharon Carter\n was giving a speech, revealing herself as Peggy's niece. Wilson listened to Carter's speech in which she described her time growing up with the \nStrategic Scientific Reserve\n's head, and described the lessons learned from her aunt, making both Wilson and Rogers consider the \nSokovia Accords\n' decision.\n[\n21\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nSteve Rogers\n making their toast\n \n \nOnce the funeral was over, Wilson joined Rogers in a \nLondon\n pub, as they made the toast to both being given an honorable discharge from the \nAvengers\n. Rogers had then questioned if Wilson was doing okay following their decision, although he insisted that he was, claiming that he would make for a great civilian. Looking over the bar, Wilson saw that Carter was also there, as he suggested that Rogers should go and speak to her, which Rogers finally did.\n[\n22\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson informs \nRogers\n and \nCarter\n \n \nWilson had then allowed Rogers and Carter time alone to catch up. However, when a bomb was \ndetonated\n just outside from the \nVienna International Centre\n where the Accords were getting signed. Wilson had then informed Rogers and Carter of the situation, as they then watched the news report which informed them that King \nT'Chaka\n of \nWakanda\n had been killed in that explosion, and that their authorities had suspected the \nWinter Soldier\n was responsible for the attack.\n[\n21\n]\nFinding Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson agrees to help locate \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me.\"\nFalcon to \nCaptain America\n[src]\nThe three traveled into \nVienna\n to investigate. While \nSteve Rogers\n had returned from his conversation with \nNatasha Romanoff\n, Wilson asked him if Romanoff told him not to interfere, but Rogers had still insisted that \nBucky Barnes\n would do the same for him, with Wilson noting that maybe in \n1945\n, but this was not the case. Carter joined them, as she explained to them that Barnes had just been located in \nBucharest\n. However, she also noted that the \nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre\n's leader, \nEverett Ross\n, was also targeting Barnes, with a kill order.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon flies towards an attacking helicopter\n \n \nIn \nBucharest\n, Falcon observed that \nGSG 9\n soldiers were approaching their location. As Captain America talked with Barnes in his \napartment\n, Falcon updated him on the soldiers' positions. Captain America and Barnes then fought against the soldiers and escaped, but \nBlack Panther\n arrived, and attempted to kill Barnes. Falcon was asked to take care of the GSG 9 helicopter which was shooting at them, so Falcon then smashed into the side of it.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is attacked by the \nBlack Panther\n \n \nTheir battle continued through the road tunnel, with GSG 9 soldiers chasing the three with their vehicles. Falcon flew after his allies, using the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n's speed and agility to catch up with them, so Captain America had then asked Falcon to help him shake Black Panther, who was refusing to give up on his quest to kill Barnes. Falcon flew through the tunnel as he caught Black Panther in midair, only for Black Panther to use it to his benefit.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is surrounded by agents\n \n \nBlack Panther used Falcon's speed to catch up with his prey, before Falcon braked when Barnes used his \ngrenades\n to explode the tunnel entrance, launching Black Panther forward. Black Panther caught Barnes, but was kept from killing him by Captain America before the GSG 9 arrested all of them, with the help of \nWar Machine\n. Once he removed his helmet, Falcon then discovered that Black Panther was actually \nT'Challa\n, the prince of \nWakanda\n.\n[\n21\n]\nHeld by Everett Ross\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson mocks \nT'Challa\n's panther uniform\n \n \n\"We looked for the \nguy\n for two years and found nothing.\"\n\"We didn't \nbomb\n the \nU.N\n. That turns a lot of heads.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nWhile \nGSG 9\n agents were transporting the four individuals to the \nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre\n's \nheadquarters\n in \nBerlin\n, Wilson insults \nT'Challa\n over his \nsuit\n, asking if he liked cats, despite the efforts of \nSteve Rogers\n to make him stop, knowing that he'll make the situation worse. Remaining serious about their situation, T'Challa had then calmly explained to them that the \nPanther Habit\n is made of \nvibranium\n, and his reasons for attacking \nBucky Barnes\n was due to Barnes seemingly killing his \nfather\n during a \nterrorist attack\n, promising that he would eventually kill him.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson having his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n taken away\n \n \nAs they arrived, they were greeted by \nSharon Carter\n, who introduced them to \nEverett Ross\n, the head of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, who was waiting for them. Ross had refused to give them any clear information about what would happen to Barnes, before he informed the group that all their gear would be confiscated until further notice, causing Wilson to grumble that he better would not see anybody else using the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n while he was still waiting to get it back.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson follows \nEverett Ross\n \n \nWith Barnes being taken away into another room for a psychological evaluation, conducted by \nTheo Broussard\n, Wilson, along with Rogers and T'Challa were led through their facility by Ross, who noted that they would be given offices rather than prison cells. They were then joined by \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who had expressed her displeasure at seeing the situation, since she had already warned Rogers not to get involved, although Rogers had noted that they saved Barnes' life.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nRogers\n are stopped by \nStark\n \n \nWilson and Rogers had eventually come across \nTony Stark\n, who was speaking to \nThaddeus Ross\n, and made it clear that there would now be serious consequences for their actions in protecting Barnes, as he wanted them both sent to the \nRaft\n. Stark had also noted that Wilson would not get his wings, while Rogers would not get his \nshield\n, much to his dismay as he then called the decision completely cold-hearted, while Stark had then noted that it was at least warmer than any jail.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson watches \nBucky Barnes\n' interrogation\n \n \nWilson joined Rogers and Carter as they watched the interview of the contained Barnes by the psychoanalyst Broussard, with Carter then handing Wilson the receipt for his suit, which Wilson had complained about as the receipt listed his EXO-7 Falcon as the bird costume. As they were all watching the interrogation about those terrorist attacks, Rogers suspected an ulterior motive behind releasing Barnes' picture to the public, questioning Carter about why this had happened.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discusses \nBucky Barnes\n being found\n \n \nAlthough Wilson reminded him that they had searched for Barnes for two years and had failed to find him anywhere, but Rogers noted that they had not bombed the \nUnited Nations\n which had drawn attention. Hearing all this, Wilson and Carter began to catch up to what Rogers was thinking, as they then realized that somebody might have been attempting to get closer to Barnes, as they looked up at their screen, becoming suspicious of the man who was interrogating Barnes.\n[\n21\n]\nWinter Soldier's Escape\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nRogers\n locate \nHelmut Zemo\n \n \n\"Hey!\"\nSam Wilson to \nHelmut Zemo\n[src]\nSuddenly, the power across the entire \nfacility\n was then cut out, which had ignited panic across the base since their camera feed to \nBucky Barnes\n' interrogation was also cut out. Once \nSharon Carter\n told them where to go, Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n quickly hurried down into the interrogation room, where they found several men lying unconscious on the ground, before finding their psycho-analyst, \nHelmut Zemo\n, on the ground without Barnes, before Rogers had then immediately confronted Zemo.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is ambushed by \nWinter Soldier\n \n \nWhile Rogers then questioned Zemo about what he actually wanted, Barnes revealed he was free from his cell and had been brainwashed back to his \nWinter Soldier\n programming. The Winter Soldier attacked Wilson and had attempted to crush his neck with his \nprosthetic arm\n. However, Wilson had managed to get free from Winter Soldier's grip, before he was then knocked unconscious as Winter Soldier threw him backwards before then furiously fighting against Rogers.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson watches \nHelmut Zemo\n escaping\n \n \nOnce Wilson had woken back up from Winter Soldier's attack, he had then spotted that Zemo was looking down an elevator shaft that Rogers had been thrown down. Fearing that he would be attempting to make his escape, Wilson had called after Zemo, only for him who begin running away from the \nAvenger\n. Wilson then ran after him and followed him up the stairs until they made it outside, all the while with a fight breaking out between Winter Soldier and the security.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson failing to stop \nHelmut Zemo\n's escape\n \n \nHowever, Wilson then lost sight of Zemo outside the building where he had disappeared into the crowds of people who were running for their lives in the chaos, only being able to find Zemo's jacket which he had left behind to help him get away. Wilson later regrouped with Rogers, who had managed to capture Winter Soldier when they had both been thrown from the roof of the headquarters while in his helicopter, which Winter Soldier had attempted to escape in.\n[\n21\n]\nGoing on the Run\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson watches \nBucky Barnes\n waking up\n \n \n\"This would have been a lot easier a week ago.\"\n\"If we call \nTony\n\"\n\"No, he won't believe us.\"\n\"Even if he did...\"\n\"Who knows if the \nAccords\n would let him help.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nWith their battle now over, Wilson and \nSteve Rogers\n had then taken an unconscious \nBucky Barnes\n into an abandoned building where they then subdued him by trapping his \nprosthetic arm\n in the vice. Once Barnes awoke, they questioned if he was still under \nmind control\n, as Barnes revealed he was safe by noting key facts about his and Rogers' childhood and Rogers' \nmother\n, although Wilson had still remained skeptical that this was actually proof that Barnes was no longer a danger to them, although Rogers assured him it was okay.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson awaits answers about \nHelmut Zemo\n \n \nTo his horror, Barnes realized what he had done as the programming that \nHYDRA\n put in his mind was still there, and \nHelmut Zemo\n simply had to do was say the codewords to reactivate him. Wilson stood by as Rogers had questioned Barnes about who Zemo was, noting that Zemo had killed multiple people in his \nattacks\n to get close to Barnes. Thinking for a moment, Barnes then noted that Zemo had asked him about the \nFacility\n in \nSiberia\n where he had been kept for decades.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learns about other \nWinter Soldiers\n \n \nAs Wilson listened, Barnes explained that there were multiple \nWinter Soldiers\n, and that they were likely Zemo's target. Wilson checked if the Soldiers had also turned out like Barnes after being injected with the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n, as Barnes explained that they had turned out even worse. They then realized that if Zemo gained control of the soldiers, he could use them to infiltrate and completely destabilize an entire country overnight without anybody seeing them coming.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson recommending they recruit \nAnt-Man\n \n \nHaving seemingly figured out Zemo's plans, Wilson and Rogers then deliberated their course of action; noting that because of the \nSokovia Accords\n the situation had become more complicated. While Rogers suggested they call \nTony Stark\n for assistance, Wilson noted that he would not go against those Accords, meaning that they were on their own. However, Wilson then considered \nAnt-Man\n, noting that he knew a guy who could potentially assist them with defeating Zemo.\n[\n21\n]\nBuilding the Team\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBarnes\n meet \nSharon Carter\n \n \n\"What's up, Tic Tac.\"\n\"Uh... Good to see you. Look, \nwhat\n happened last time\"\n\"It was a great audition, but it'll never happen again.\"\nSam Wilson and \nScott Lang\n[src]\nWith the help of \nSharon Carter\n, the group went on the run. Carter met them and revealed that she had gone behind \nEverett Ross\n' back and gave them their equipment back. While \nSteve Rogers\n spoke with Carter, Wilson remained in their car with \nBucky Barnes\n, rudely refusing to move his seat to give Barnes more leg room, since he still dislikes him from their previous battles. After Rogers had kissed Carter as she left, both Wilson and Barnes smiled approvingly at their friend's success with Carter, much to Rogers' great embarrassment.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nSteve Rogers\n greet \nClint Barton\n \n \nWilson, Rogers and Barnes then reunited with \nClint Barton\n, who was with \nWanda Maximoff\n near to \nLeipzig-Halle Airport\n, as Barton made it clear to them that he was happy to assist them by breaking Maximoff out of the \nAvengers Compound\n, before welcoming \nScott Lang\n to the team. While Wilson had watched on awkwardly, Lang expressed his excitement at meeting Rogers and these other heroes, as he thanked Rogers for inviting him onto the team and touching his muscles.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson welcomes \nScott Lang\n onto the team\n \n \nLang then happily greeted Wilson as he also attempted to apologize for their previous encounter at the Avengers Compound where Lang had defeated Wilson during the \nclash\n. However, Wilson cut off Lang's sentence, insisting that their clash had merely been Lang's audition into the \nAvengers\n, and also claimed that he would never allow that to happen again, before Rogers brought Lang up to date about \nHelmut Zemo\n and the \nWinter Soldiers\n, noting they were against the law.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson prepares for the mission\n \n \nOnce Lang agreed to join them on their mission, the team prepared to get moving as Barton noted that they had a helicopter ready to get them out of \nGermany\n. However, they then heard alarms being set off, which Barnes confirmed meant that the airport was being evacuated, as Wilson noted that this was likely \nTony Stark\n arriving to bring them into custody. Rogers ordered the team to suit up, as Wilson donned his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n and joined his allies in attempting to escape.\n[\n21\n]\nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon manages to locate the \nQuinjet\n \n \n\"I don't know if you've been a fight before, but there's usually not this much talking.\"\n\"All right, sorry, my bad.\"\nFalcon and \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nWhile \nCaptain America\n allowed himself to be cornered and disarmed by \nIron Man\n's team of heroes, Falcon took position further away from their confrontation and scanned the \nairport\n. As Captain America was keeping Iron Man distracted, Falcon sent \nRedwing\n to scan the airport, and eventually found the \nQuinjet\n that Iron Man's team had then arrived with in Hangar 5, using his \nCombat Goggles\n. Falcon then alerted Captain America, revealing to Iron Man's team the rest of the various rebels as they all had begun running towards the Quinjet.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon comments on \nSpider-Man\n's gimmick\n \n \nFalcon and \nWinter Soldier\n then made their way towards the hangar, while Captain America had kept \nBlack Panther\n from catching up with them and attempting to kill the Winter Soldier. As they had run, they saw that \nSpider-Man\n was following them, as Falcon noted with some frustration that all heroes had gimmicks nowadays. Spider-Man then attacked with a kick against Falcon, before then engaging Winter Soldier, being amazed by his \nmetal arm\n while Falcon recovered.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon fights \nSpider-Man\n through the air\n \n \nFalcon recovered from the kick and flew back into the fight, knocking Spider-Man away from Winter Soldier as the two started to battle through the airport's terminal, as Spider-Man was attempting to take Falcon into his custody. Falcon fought Spider-Man in the air, shooting missiles at him, while Winter Soldier tried to throw heavy objects at him, only for them to discover that Spider-Man was able to predict their movements and counter them while making snarky comments.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is webbed to the railing\n \n \nAlthough Falcon was able to catch Spider-Man by surprise, and kick him off a platform, Spider-Man swiftly recovered as he flipped behind Falcon, and using his \nSynthetic Webbing\n to then damage the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, causing Falcon to crash land, using his \nWeb-Shooters\n to trap him against the railing. With Falcon now webbed up to that handrail, Spider-Man then asked if his wings were made from Carbon-Fibre, to which Falcon had questioned if the webbing came out of his body.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon and \nWinter Soldier\n are webbed down\n \n \nWhile Falcon recommended that he focus more on the fight than the conversation, Spider-Man lunged towards Falcon to knock him to the floor, only for the kick to be intercepted by Winter Soldier, which knocked them both off the platform. Spider Man webbed the two to the floor, but before he could do any more damage, Falcon had then controlled \nRedwing\n to take Spider-Man out from the terminal, leaving him and Winter Soldier on the floor, still insulting each other.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon runs beside \nCaptain America\n's team\n \n \nHaving regrouped back with their team, Falcon then ran towards the Quinjet's Hangar in order to escape, only to be stopped by the laser beam blasted by \nVision\n, who had then implored their team who were against the \nSokovia Accords\n to surrender now before it was too late. They refused and the two opposing sides had charged towards each other, picking up an individual fight with Falcon tackling \nWar Machine\n in the air. When Vision then tried to attack Falcon, he was stopped by an \nelectric arrow\n shot from \nHawkeye\n, helping Falcon to fly away.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is chased around by \nWar Machine\n \n \nFalcon was later chased down by both Iron Man and War Machine as they used their combined weapons to try and knock him out from the sky, to which Falcon asked Hawkeye for some assistance. Hawkeye teamed up with \nAnt-Man\n to help Falcon and stop Iron Man, shooting his scatter arrow with Ant-Man riding it, which had then allowed Ant-Man to enter in the \nIron Man Armor\n, therefore stopping Iron Man from chasing Falcon further since Ant-Man disabled it from the inside.\n[\n21\n]\nWinning a Losing Battle\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon and his team discuss the mission\n \n \n\"This isn't the real fight, Steve.\"\n\"All right, Sam, what's the plan?\"\n\"We need a diversion. Something big.\"\nFalcon and \nCaptain America\n[src]\nAs their fight between the \nAvengers\n continued, Falcon and their team had then realized that not all of them could win and get to \nSiberia\n, as Falcon noted this was not their real fight as \nCaptain America\n needed to find \nHelmut Zemo\n. Falcon, while he was being chased around the airport by \nWar Machine\n, suggested that they make a diversion so Captain America and \nWinter Soldier\n could attempt to reach the \nQuinjet\n, as \nAnt-Man\n then volunteered to make a big distraction.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon attacking \nIron Man\n \n \nWhile admitting that this distraction could result in him being torn in half, Ant-Man then told them to wait for the signal and jumped onto War Machine's back while he was still chasing down Falcon. All of a sudden, Ant-Man grew to an enormous size and caught War Machine in mid-air, signaling the diversion. Witnessing this remarkable feat by his ally, Falcon had complimented Giant-Man, before then smashing straight into \nIron Man\n, who had become distracted by the event.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon shoots \nRedwing\n directly at \nIron Man\n \n \nWhile Captain America and the Winter Soldier used the distraction of GiAnt-Man tearing through the airport to allow them to run towards the Quinjet, Falcon had scrapped with Iron Man in mid air, to ensure he did not realize what was happening, although \nBlack Panther\n was chasing them down. Falcon quickly disengaged his wings to perform a freefall as he launched \nRedwing\n, which flew directly into Iron Man's helmet, stunning him as Falcon re-activated his wings and flew off.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon chases \nIron Man\n and \nWar Machine\n \n \nAs Captain America and Winter Soldier had made it on board the Quinjet, Iron Man and War Machine were behind them attempting to stop their mission. Witnessing this, Falcon flew after them as he tried to shoot his missiles to distract War Machine and protect the Quinjet. However, when Falcon saw \nVision\n's shooting his laser beams at him, deactivated the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n to avoid the blast. The beam, however, hit War Machine's \nArc Reactor\n, disabling the \nsuit\n, causing him to fall.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon witnesses \nWar Machine\n's near death\n \n \nWar Machine fell helplessly thousands of feet to the ground, despite Falcon and Iron Man's efforts to save him. Although he survived, but Rhodes was left paralyzed by the impact. Falcon was shocked for his mistake, he told Stark that he was sorry, but Stark, enraged, had fired his repulsor blast at Falcon, knocking him unconscious and signalling the end of their clash, with Falcon then being put under arrest, under the direct orders of Secretary \nThaddeus Ross\n, as well as Stark.\n[\n21\n]\nImprisoned in the Raft\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is visited by \nTony Stark\n in the \nRaft\n \n \n\"You're the good cop now?\"\n\"I'm just a guy who needs to know \nwhere\n \nSteve\n went.\"\n\"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go \nMark Fuhrman\n on my ass to get information out of me.\"\nSam Wilson and \nTony Stark\n[src]\nFollowing their defeat during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, Wilson and his allies were imprisoned in the \nRaft\n under the orders of \nThaddeus Ross\n. While they sat in the cells, Wilson had watched on as \nTony Stark\n came to visit them, only to be mocked by \nClint Barton\n for his actions, while Stark had insisted they were there for breaking the rules of the \nSokovia Accords\n, before Stark went to speak with Wilson.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is questioned about \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWhile Stark ignored \nScott Lang\n's attempts to mock him, Wilson had asked about \nJames Rhodes\n' condition, as Stark assured him that he was going to alright now that he was getting treatment. As Stark had questioned where \nSteve Rogers\n and \nBucky Barnes\n had gone, Wilson refused to give them up, only for Stark to shut down the audio in the prison. Stark showed Wilson an image of \nTheo Broussard\n lying dead, before noting that Broussard was meant to interrogate Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson helps \nTony Stark\n to find \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nAcknowledging that \nHelmut Zemo\n had deceived him, Stark admitted that he was wrong, noting that Rogers was going to need all the help he could get with stopping Zemo and their \nWinter Soldiers\n. Agreeing to help him, Wilson told Stark that Rogers and Barnes were heading to the \nHYDRA Facility\n in \nSiberia\n, but had also insisted that Stark had to go there alone, and with his intention only being of helping Rogers as his friend, which Stark had agreed to as he departed the Raft.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is freed by \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWhile Wilson remained locked up in the Raft, he was eventually freed when Rogers broke inside and released him, along with Barton, Lang and \nWanda Maximoff\n.\n[\n21\n]\n Once freed, Barton, Lang and Maximoff had decided to return to their homes, while Wilson agreed to remain with Rogers.\n[\n23\n]\nOn the Run\n[\n]\nFighting the Needle\n[\n]\n\"\nThey\n come from various countries and have varying backgrounds. But they all share a single goal: to destabilize the Middle East, and all for a buck.\"\n\"Money. Makes people do crazy things. That's why I'm not a millionaire.\"\n\nNatasha Romanoff\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nSeveral weeks after the escape, Wilson went to \nParkhar\n with \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n to \nParkhar\n, \nTajikistan\n, where the \nNeedle\n had been selling \nChitauri\n weapons. The three caught up and discussed \nT'Challa\n as they approached Parkhar. Romanoff reviewed their intel on the \nNeedle\n, a weapons-dealing organization with varying background who were selling \nChitauri\n weapons, hoping to profit off destabilizing the Middle East. Romanoff explained that they knew very literal about the technology the Needle had, leading Wilson to say that it was the best mission ever.\nWilson flew into the sky and searched for the entrance to the base, but could not find anything. Rogers and Romanoff realized the base would be underground, so they regrouped and started making noise to draw out the Needle's forces. They brought a fuel cylinder from the \nQuinjet\n into the desert and blew it up, drawing out the Needle's forces. Rogers and Wilson fought the Needle while Romanoff infiltrated the base. She called for back-up, so Wilson and Rogers went into the base and saw the ticking bomb which Romanoff had discovered. Rogers asked Romanoff to deactivate it, so she stole a weapon from a Needle soldier and froze it so that Rogers could punch and destroy it before the three left the base. Wilson and Romanoff talked about the fact that they would have to talk to \nTony Stark\n eventually, and Rogers assured them that Stark knew they would be there for him. Wilson assured the team that Rogers and Stark would be able to put their differences aside when the next threat came, but Rogers and Romanoff could only express hope that he was right.\n[\n24\n]\nInfiltrating Terrorists\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Secret Avengers prepare for the next mission\n \n \nFor months from going on the run,\n[\n23\n]\n the three evaded capture thanks to their ties with \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n[\n16\n]\n Romanoff, Wilson, and Rogers were shortly met by \nNick Fury\n and they assisted in his underground mission to track terrorist cells in \nSyria\n who used \nChitauri\n fuelled weapons.\n[\n25\n]\n Using Romanoff's contacts within the KGB to track down a terrorist organization supplied with \nChitauri\n fueled weapons, Wilson, Rogers, and Romanoff infiltrated the terrorists and disabled the weapons and then left for \nLebanon\n.\n[\n23\n]\nInfinity War\n[\n]\nRescuing Vision\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon battling the \nBlack Order\n members\n \n \n\"Where to, Cap?\"\n\"\nHome\n.\"\nFalcon and \nCaptain America\n[src]\nHaving been warned by \nBruce Banner\n that \nThanos\n would be sending down the \nBlack Order\n to \nEarth\n in order to claim the remaining \nInfinity Stones\n, Falcon and his allies had travelled to \nEdinburgh\n, \nScotland\n in order to protect \nVision\n. Their team arrived just as \nProxima Midnight\n and \nCorvus Glaive\n were still attempting to rip the \nMind Stone\n from Vision's head.

However, Midnight insisted that they would never get the chance again, as she activated her teleporter as she and Glaive were taken back onboard their \nQ-Ship\n, ripping their \nweapons\n out of Captain America's hands while Midnight and Glaive escaped, leaving Falcon and his allies to then check on Vision, as he had been badly wounded by Glaive during the sudden attack.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon helps out \nVision\n following his attack\n \n \nAs Falcon and Maximoff helped Vision back to his feet, they had discovered that his \nVibranium\n body was damaged. Knowing Thanos' Black Order would attempt to destroy Vision again to take the Mind Stone, Falcon helped him on board the \nQuinjet\n so they could take him to safety. On board, Falcon questioned where they would be going, as Captain America told him that they would go to the \nAvengers Compound\n, for the first time ever since the \nAvengers\n had fallen apart.\n[\n10\n]\nReunited with Friends\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson returns to the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"You guys... really look like crap.

When they had arrived with Vision, Wilson and the rest of the team had then found \nJames Rhodes\n speaking with \nThaddeus Ross\n via a hologram.

However, \nBruce Banner\n had then revealed that he was also in there, since Banner had reunited with \nNatasha Romanoff\n for the first time since their \nUltron Offensive\n. Watching their reunion, Wilson had then jokingly commented on the awkwardness of the situation.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discussing all \nThanos\n' recent attacks\n \n \nWilson then joined the rest of the \nAvengers\n as they discussed what was to be done in order to protect Vision and also stop \nThanos\n from obtaining the \nMind Stone\n in his quest to find all these \nInfinity Stones\n. Eventually, it was decided that the best option for them was to take Vision to \nWakanda\n, where they could recruit the aid of \nShuri\n to then remove the Mind Stone from Vision's head, while keeping him alive, so they could destroy the Stone and keep it away from Thanos.\n[\n10\n]\nArriving in Wakanda\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson piloting the \nQuinjet\n over to \nWakanda\n \n \n\"Drop to twenty six hundred, heading zero-three-zero.\"\n\"I hope you're right about this.

In order to keep them away from their armies, Falcon flew above the Outriders and fired his \nTwin Guns\n at them, before then shooting out his \nRedwings\n to cut through the Outriders. With too many Outriders breaking through, \nWar Machine\n advised Falcon to fly away before then dropping several massive bombs on top of these Outriders, as this caused a massive explosion but failed to stop the Outriders.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon destroys the \nThresher\n \n \nDespite keeping these Outriders away, it was discovered that several were attempting to get behind them to attack \nVision\n and \nShuri\n, which had forced \nBlack Panther\n to open their barriers in keep the Outriders' attention on them. With the Outriders charging into Wakanda, Falcon flew into the fight, until \nThor\n had arrived with \nRocket\n as well as \nGroot\n to assist them.

Falcon informed their team about this, only for him to be knocked out of the sky by an Outrider, while \nBruce Banner\n and Maximoff both volunteered to go to the aid of Vision, in order to ensure Glaive could not steal the \nMind Stone\n out of his head.\n[\n10\n]\nThanos' Victory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon notices \nThanos\n entering \nWakanda\n \n \n\"Sam!

However, before the team could celebrate this victory, they had then witnessed the arrival of \nThanos\n through a \nwormhole\n. Realizing that \nVision\n was once again out in the open and in great danger, Falcon and the other Avengers readied themselves for the fight, while Thanos had calmly walked towards his target.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon attempts to shoot \nThanos\n \n \nHowever, it swiftly became clear that Thanos was considerably more powerful than any of the Avengers, as he then used the power of the five \nInfinity Stones\n he had collected to entrap \nBruce Banner\n in a wall, before easily subduing \nBlack Panther\n and \nCaptain America\n. Falcon tried to stop him by shooting his \nTwin Guns\n at the Mad Titan, but he was hopelessly outclassed by Thanos' power, as Falcon was taken out after Thanos had used the \nSpace Stone\n to knock him down.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is faded away into dust by \nThanos\n \n \nWith Falcon out of the fight, the other Avengers all found themselves outmatched, as Thanos ripped the \nMind Stone\n out of Vision's head.

Wilson had stood with \nBucky Barnes\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n, as they watched \nPepper Potts\n and \nMorgan Stark\n walk down and then place Stark's \nArc Reactor\n into the lake. Seeing how Barnes was saddened by Stark's death, Wilson had placed his comforting hand onto his shoulder.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson offers to travel with \nCaptain America\n \n \nFollowing Stark's funeral, the Avengers decided to return the Infinity Stones and \nMjlnir\n to whence they were taken to stop devastating branches in those timelines. Wilson met up with \nSteve Rogers\n, since it was Rogers who had volunteered for their mission, meeting him in the forest just outside their destroyed \nAvengers Facility\n, where \nBruce Banner\n constructed a new time machine. Wilson had then offered to accompany Rogers on the mission, but Rogers politely declined.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson watching \nSteve Rogers\n time-travel\n \n \nWilson then asked how long this would take, which Banner informed him that it would be however long it would take Rogers to complete this mission, but it would only be around five seconds for the rest of them. Wilson watched as Rogers put on the \nTime Suit\n, as they awaited for their mission to begin. Banner had then sent Rogers through the \nQuantum Realm\n. However, Wilson witnessed Rogers not returning after the five seconds that Banner had promised.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson realizes what \nSteve Rogers\n has done\n \n \nWilson then became concerned as he then demanded Banner bring Rogers back, until he was stopped as Barnes had calmly directed his attention to the lake, where an old man was sitting on a bench alone. As he then realized this was Rogers, Wilson walked over and greeted him, seeing that he had aged considerably since they last saw each other. Wilson had asked about the mission, which Rogers just told him that he stayed out in the \n1949\n to live a peaceful life.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson greeting the older \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWith Rogers noting that once he had put the Infinity Stones back, he had decided to live out a life that Stark had always told him about, as he told Wilson that it was a beautiful life. Wilson told him he was truly happy for him, but expressed his sadness in living in a world with no Captain America in it. However, this had then led Rogers to reveal his \nshield\n, which he told Wilson to try on, while the surprised Wilson turned to Barnes, who gave him his nod of encouragement.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson being given \nCaptain America\n's \nshield\n \n \nWilson was hesitant about taking up the shield, while Barnes nodded to him, supporting him to claim it. He then picked it up, saying it felt like it did not belong to him. Rogers had reassured Wilson's doubts, confirming that it was his now. Wilson thanked Rogers for the honor, promising to do his best. The two then shook hands, causing Wilson to notice the ring on Rogers' finger, so he then asked about his \nwife\n, as Rogers politely stated that he would not tell Wilson about her.\n[\n26\n]\n The \nAvengers\n wondered about who should be the one to write a book about them, and Wilson was certain that \nScott Lang\n was the best choice.\n[\n28\n]\nReturn to the Military\n[\n]\nRescue of Captain Vassant\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon being briefed on the rescue mission\n \n \n\"I got it.

Having been recruited once more, Wilson was informed by Major \nHill\n that Captain \nVassant\n had been kidnapped by a group called \nLAF\n, who were attempting to take Vassant into \nLibya\n, with Hill telling Wilson that they needed him to ensure that LAF was not successful.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon prepares to fly up to \nVassant\n's plane\n \n \nAs Wilson prepared to begin the mission, Hill explained that the military could not been seen actin in Tunisian airspace, with Wilson understanding that he would be dropped off, where he would fly low and intercept with Vassant's plane, without the treaties being seen to be violated. Hill also explained that \nJoaqun Torres\n would be aiding on the mission on the ground, as Wilson activated his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, and dropped out of the plane, with Hill reminding him to be subtle.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon catches up with the hijacked plane\n \n \nWhile he flew towards the hijacked plane, Falcon was informed by Torres that he would be getting his intel on his \nCombat Goggles\n, as Falcon caught up with the plane, questioning if LAF could be seen nearby, which Torres denied. However, as Falcon attached himself to the side of their plane, he looked inside and discovered that the pilot was dead, with \nLouie\n having taken over, as Falcon had explained to Torres that LAF had already managed to hijack the plane.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon flying close by their hijacked plane\n \n \nHowever, Falcon briefly stayed too close to the window and was spotted by Louie, with Falcon flying back to avoid further detection, although Louie's protests about a man on the outside of the plane were not believed by his allies. Using his goggles, Falcon scanned the plane and located Vassant, who was being beaten by LAF agents, resulting in Falcon sending \nRedwing\n to cut through the door of the plane with its lasers, intending to surprise the LAF agents.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon ambushes \nGeorges Batroc\n's soldiers\n \n \nOnce Redwing had torn off the door, Falcon burst inside and had immediately subdued \nGeorges Batroc\n with a powerful kick, before proceeding to take down the next three LAF agents as they tried to understand what was happening, with Falcon kicking one agent out of the plane. As another agent began shooting at him, Falcon used his wings to block the bullets, resulting in one killing Louie, causing the plane to fall, while Falcon subdued the last agent with his jetpack.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon fights back against \nGeorges Batroc\n \n \nAs the plane fell into autopilot, Falcon turned to Vassant, and prepared to get him off the plane, only for Batroc to charge at him and assault Falcon with a strong kick to the face. However, Falcon was able to fight back against Batroc, blocking and avoiding his punches and kicks, before kicking him in the chest. As Falcon attempted to charge at Batroc with his jetpack, Batroc was able to grab him in mid-air, and slam him back down to the ground and kick him back.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon blocking \nGeorges Batroc\n's gunshots\n \n \nOnce Falcon got back to his feet, he witnessed Batroc and the other LAF agents donning their \nLAF Wingsuits\n and leaping out of the plane with Vassant, as Batroc had shot at Falcon to keep him at bay, with Falcon blocking the gunshots with his wings. Once the shooting had stopped, Falcon realized they were escaping, and leapt out from the plane to catch up with Batroc and to rescue Vassant, with one agent shooting at Falcon, only for him to pull the agent's parachute.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon chases down \nGeorges Batroc\n's men\n \n \nFalcon proceeded to chase Batroc's men into a canyon, where his wings caused him to be at a disadvantage, as he was unable to fly through the smaller gaps in the rocks, briefly scrapping his wings during the chase. Falcon had then discovered that Batroc had called in a squad of helicopters, causing Falcon to deploy Redwing to take down the helicopters. As Redwing shot at the next helicopter, Falcon dragged the gunner out with a cable, while Redwing took out its propellers.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon takes down more of the \nLAF\n soldiers\n \n \nSeeing Vassant was taken to a third helicopter, Falcon attempted to catch up with him, only for an LAF agents to slam into him in midair. However, Falcon was swiftly able to subdue the agent, and threw him against the rocks, causing him to fall to his death, while Falcon continued chasing Vassant. Falcon managed to board the helicopter, just as Batroc had been bragging that they would escape, as Falcon took down one agent, while the other had then damaged his jetpack.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon avoiding the multiple \nLAF\n missiles\n \n \nDuring the struggle, Batroc was able to get away with Vassant, as Falcon subdued the other LAF agents, leaping off the helicopter and destroying it with a grenade. While his thrusters were damaged, Falcon was informed by Torres that he was approaching \nLibyan\n airspace, where the military could not enter, and would only have ninety seconds to complete the mission. Making matters worse, was another LAF helicopter that began shooting at Falcon, as he struggled to escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon takes \nVassant\n from \nGeorges Batroc\n \n \nDuring the chaos, Falcon barely avoided the missiles, and almost flew into the helicopter blades, before managing to fly close enough to one helicopter, that the missiles destroyed it. Although Torres attempted to call off the mission, Falcon's thrusters came back alone, allowing him to fly directly through Batroc's helicopter, dragging Vassant to safety, moments before the missiles destroyed the helicopter, which Batroc barely survived, as Falcon flew Vassant to the ground.\n[\n16\n]\nLearning of the Flag Smashers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nTorres\n discussing the mission\n \n \n\"Trust me, every time something gets better for one group, it gets worse for another.\"\n\"Essentially, \nthese people\n, they want a world that's unified without borders.\"\nSam Wilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n[src]\nFollowing their successful rescue of \nVassant\n, Wilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n went to a \nTunisian\n caf, where Wilson began to work on \nRedwing\n, repairing the damage done during his fight against \nLAF\n.

Wilson then packed up Redwing, with Torres offering to pay for the tea, as Wilson explained that he was heading to \nWashington, D.C.\n, but had jokingly claimed that he would be going to deal with Moon business.\n[\n16\n]\nDonating the Shield\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson looking at \nCaptain America\n's \nshield\n \n \n\"I don't know if there's ever been a greater symbol.

Having ironed his shirt, Wilson finished getting dressed into his suit, before looking down at the shield on his bed, picking it up and studying it closely, before gently putting it inside of his bag and departing for the ceremony.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson paying his tributes to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWilson had then gone to the \nSmithsonian Institution\n for the ceremony, where he gave a speech to the crowd, paying tribute to Rogers, who he claimed had represented the best in all of them. Wilson described Rogers as being courageous and hopeful, as well as jokingly claiming that he mastered posing stoically, which the crowd laughed at. Wilson had then acknowledged how the world had changed since the \nBlip\n, describing how the world into complete turmoil.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson insists the world needs new heroes\n \n \nWilson had claimed the world needed new heroes, who were suited for the times that they now were living in, which Wilson still did not believe that he was qualified to become. With that, Wilson told the crowd that symbols were nothing without the men and women who gave them the true meaning, before he also claimed that there had never been any greater symbol than Captain America's shield, but had also insisted that the shield was nothing without Rogers.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson gives the \nshield\n to the \nSmithsonian\n \n \nWilson insisted that it was time for them to acknowledge Rogers' legacy, as well as looking to the future. With that, Wilson thanked Captain America, but handed the shield over to the Smithsonian, where it was put on display, alongside Captain America's \nuniform\n, \nMotorcycle\n and other items from his life. Following the speech and the handing over ceremony, Wilson had joined \nJames Rhodes\n and a \nGovernment Official\n who thanked Wilson for handing over the shield, claiming that it was the right thing to do. Once the Official shook his hand and departed, Wilson was invited by Rhodes to have a talk.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is thanked for donating the \nshield\n \n \nWilson told Rhodes that he had spent time in \nLouisiana\n, where he had seen his \nsister\n and \ntwo\n \nnephews\n, who had grown up while he had been gone, with Rhodes offering to teach them how to fly if they ever came to Washington. Rhodes commented that it seemed crazy to him that nobody would be wielding the shield, to which Wilson acknowledged that nobody had wielded it for seventy years, although Rhodes insisted that lived in a different time.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson talks to \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nRhodes had then asked Wilson why he had chosen not to take up the mantle of Captain America, to which Wilson explained that he had always felt that the shield had belonged to somebody else, which he had said to Rogers as soon as he was given the shield. As they looked at various photographs of Captain America, Rhodes commented that the world was a crazy place, where nobody was really stable, while various alliances had since fallen apart in the wake of the Blip.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson takes a final look toward the \nshield\n \n \nWilson was told by Rhodes that everybody had been looking for somebody to come and fix the world, which Wilson acknowledged. As the two of them looked at the shield in its new display, Rhodes told Wilson that it was a new day, before promising that he would be in touch, as Rhodes left the Smithsonian. Once he was alone, Wilson took some time to closely examine the shield in its display, as he considered his decision to hand the shield over to the Smithsonian.\n[\n16\n]\nReturning Home\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson visiting with his family in \nLouisiana\n \n \n\"Just let me help.

He was greeted by them at their family dock and was told by Sarah that their family boat, \nPaul & Darlene\n, needed repairs. Sarah also told him that their house needed financing that she did not have in order to keep it, although Wilson said half of it was his and he wanted to keep it.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson receives the news he can't get a loan\n \n \nSam told his sister that he can help her with her finance issue and took her to the \nlocal bank\n, to get a loan due to his being an Avenger. Where the employee didn't recognize Sam at first, which he reminded him that he is the Falcon. However, their appointment didn't go as well when the employee told them he couldn't give them the loan. Sam refusing to give up, saying he owned half of it also and they're not selling the boat.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson sees the new \nCaptain America\n \n \nAfterwards, he received a text from \nJoaqun Torres\n and returned to Sarah's house. He video-chatted with Torres who told him about the \nRobbery of Gasel Bank\n and Wilson told him he was glad he was okay. However, Wilson was interrupted by Sarah who asked him to watch the \nWHiH World News\n report where a new \nCaptain America\n was being introduced with the shield.\n[\n16\n]\nChasing Super Soldiers\n[\n]\nReunion with Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n are reunited\n \n \n\"Shouldn't have given up the \nshield\n.\"\n\"Good to see you too, Buck.\"\n\nBucky Barnes\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nBack at the USAF base, Wilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n prepared to leave for \nGermany\n and discussed \nJohn Walker\n as the new Captain America, until Wilson was approached by \nBucky Barnes\n. A frustrated Barnes asked Wilson why he gave up the shield, but Wilson told him that he had other issues to worry about, specifically the \nFlag Smashers\n. He then told Barnes to stay behind and left for the airplane, but Barnes came anyways.\n[\n4\n]\nChase of the Flag Smashers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon ignoring all \nBucky Barnes\n' questions\n \n \n\"Hey, come on, man.

They met up at an abandoned factory and Falcon teasingly played with Barnes using Redwing. After the two made too much noise, they were spotted by the \nFlag Smashers\n who were loading heavy boxes into trucks.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon kicks at \nFlag Smasher\n \n \nFalcon and Barnes gave chase after them and caught up with the trucks on the highway. After Barnes was restrained by the terrorists and Redwing was destroyed by \nFlag Smasher\n, Falcon arrived and joined the fight, freeing Barnes to join also.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon is overpowered by \nFlag Smashers\n \n \nFalcon and Barnes were aided by the arrival of \nCaptain America\n and \nBattlestar\n who came in via a helicopter and fought the Flag Smashers. After Barnes fell off the top of truck, Falcon swooped in and grabbed him and the two rolled into the grass nearby and Barnes landed on top of Falcon, who told him to get off.\n[\n4\n]\nIntroduced to John Walker\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson continues to annoy \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"I'm not trying to be \nSteve\n. I'm not trying to replace Steve. I'm just trying to be the best Captain America I can be. That's it. It'd be a whole lot easier if I had Cap's wingmen on my side.\"\n\"It's always that last line.\"\n\nJohn Walker\n and Falcon\n[src]\nThey returned to the highway and proceeded to walk to the airport which was twenty miles away, but were found by \nJohn Walker\n and \nLemar Hoskins\n in their military vehicle.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson being first introduced to \nJohn Walker\n \n \nDespite refusing to hop in at first, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n accepted the second time and was told by Hoskins that they had tracked them down by \nRedwing\n. Wilson found out that Redwing was being used by the U.S. government and deduced that was the reason his drone was glitchy.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson becoming annoyed by \nJohn Walker\n \n \nWhen Hoskins introduced himself as \"Battlestar\", Barnes ordered the driver to stop and got out of the vehicle. Before exiting the vehicle, Walker told Wilson that was not trying to replace or be \nSteve Rogers\n. Once Walker suggested that Wilson and Barnes could be his wingmen, they hopped off the vehicle and left on their own for the airport.\n[\n4\n]\nMeeting Isaiah Bradley\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson giving \nBucky Barnes\n some advice\n \n \n\"\nSteve\n didn't know about \nhim\n?\"\n\"He didn't, I didn't tell him.\"\n\"So you're telling me that there was a black super soldier decades ago, and nobody knew about it?\"\nSam Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nOn the airplane back to the \nUnited States of America\n, Wilson listened as \nBucky Barnes\n suggest that they steal \nJohn Walker\n's \nshield\n again. Wilson reminded Barnes the last time they did that, \nSharon Carter\n was named enemy of the state, and he and \nSteve Rogers\n were on the run for two years.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson denies being known as Black Falcon\n \n \nWhen they arrived back in the U.S., Barnes took Wilson to \nBaltimore\n, \nMaryland\n. There they walked into a neighborhood and a boy called Wilson \"Black Falcon\" to which Wilson corrected and then jokingly responded back. They arrived at \nIsaiah Bradley\n's house and were greeted by his grandson, \nEli Bradley\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBarnes\n meet \nIsaiah Bradley\n \n \nAfter being let in, Wilson was introduced to Bradley and learned that he was a black super-soldier and had fought in the \nKorean War\n in the \n1950s\n. Barnes informed him of more super-soldiers and asked for his help, but Bradley responded angrily by flinging a metal can into the wall, and revealed that he was thrown in jail and scientists took samples of his blood. Wilson attempted to apologize, but Bradley angrily demanded that they leave his house.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson sees \nBucky Barnes\n being arrested\n \n \nIn the street, Wilson asked Barnes why no one had known about Bradley, before they were interrupted by Baltimore policemen who came to arrest Barnes for missing his therapy session. After Barnes was taken away in the police car, Wilson looked back at Isaiah's house and left to go to the police station.\n[\n4\n]\nSession with Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson being introduced to \nChristina Raynor\n \n \n\"Can you accept that I did what I thought was right? You know what, \nDoc\n? I don't have time for this. We have some real serious shit going on. So how about this? I will squash it right now.\"\nSam Wilson to \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nWilson arrived at the \nBaltimore Police Station\n, where he had met with \nBucky Barnes\n' therapist \nChristina Raynor\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learning about \nJohn Walker\n's actions\n \n \nThe two were interrupted when \nJohn Walker\n arrived and told Raynor that he had given permission for Barnes to be freed from therapy since he would be needed for the time being, before leaving. Wilson told Raynor he was leaving as well, only for her to force him to enter the therapy session with Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n in their therapy\n \n \nIn the session, Raynor asked them to open up about what they had problems with, but neither Wilson or Barnes felt like participating, but instead made jokes about the other. Raynor made Wilson and Barnes sit closely, facing each other, but they ended up having a staring contest, so Raynor stopped it. Barnes finally opened up and asked why Wilson gave up the \nshield\n, as it made him feel that \nSteve Rogers\n was wrong about trusting Wilson, and therefore wrong about Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson refuses to work with \nJohn Walker\n \n \nWilson explained that he did what he thought was right and decided to end the session by promising to put aside their differences for the time being. Wilson then walked out after agreeing with Barnes to go their separate ways after the conflict. After Barnes came out, the two were approached by Walker and \nLemar Hoskins\n who were waiting outside for them. Walker invited them to come join them, but Wilson politely declined telling him that they were free agents and not bound to government regulation.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discusses meeting \nHelmut Zemo\n \n \nHe and Barnes walked down the street, discussing what they should do next, until Barnes brought up the idea of meeting with \nHelmut Zemo\n in order to find out more information about the \nFlag Smashers\n, which Wilson reluctantly agreed to.\n[\n4\n]\nFreeing Helmut Zemo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBarnes\n arrive at the \nprison\n \n \n\"What are you talking about? You want to break \nZemo\n out of jail? Where the hell are we, Buck?

However, before they reached \nHelmut Zemo\n's cell, Barnes told Wilson that he would go in alone and told him they would meet up afterwards.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n inside the \ngarage\n \n \nWilson went to a garage nearby the correctional facility with Barnes, and asked what they were doing inside a garage. Barnes then told him in an indirect way that he organized a prison riot in order for a certain person to escape. The two were then met by the escaped Zemo who walked into the garage. Upon seeing Zemo out of prison, Wilson was upset and demanded to know why he was free, but after Barnes explained what happened, he reluctantly went along with Barnes' plan. However, he told Zemo that they would be watching him closely.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is taken to \nHelmut Zemo\n's \nprivate jet\n \n \nWilson and Barnes took Zemo to his \ngarage\n so he could get his belongings. While they were there, Wilson watched Zemo carefully, still not fully trusting him. After Zemo gathered his belongings, he took Wilson and Barnes to an airfield. Zemo brought Wilson and Barnes to his \nprivate plane\n and they flew off. On the plane, Zemo told them that they didn't know what life had been like in the correctional facility, but that Wilson might since he was on the \nRaft\n at one point.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson warning \nHelmut Zemo\n to be careful\n \n \nWilson wanted to know where they were going, but Zemo was interested in Barnes' notebook, which Wilson recognized as being \nSteve Rogers\n' \nnotebook\n. Wilson remembered that he had recommended \nMarvin Gaye\n to Rogers and Zemo agreed that it was a masterpiece. Eventually, Zemo told them they were going to \nMadripoor\n and that they needed disguises.\n[\n6\n]\nUndercover in Madripoor\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discusses the plan\n \n \n\"We have to do something about this, I'm the only one who looks like a pimp.\"\n\"Only an American would assume a fashion-forward Black man looks like a pimp.\"\nSam Wilson and \nBaron Zemo\n[src]\nAfter arriving on the outskirts of \nMadripoor\n, Wilson was frustrated with the clothes and admitted that he did look like he was the \nSmiling Tiger\n as he walked with \nHelmut Zemo\n and \nBucky Barnes\n. Zemo told the two they needed to remain in character upon entering the city.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson arrives inside \nMadripoor\n's center\n \n \nOnce they had arrived inside Madripoor's center, Wilson and Barnes were led by Zemo through the streets, passing armed guards and secret dealings along the way, as he took them past the \nPrincess Bar\n and instead took them to the \nBrass Monkey Saloon\n. Once inside, Zemo brought them to the bar, where the \nbartender\n mistook Wilson for Smiling Tiger, while Zemo explained that their plans had changed, and they needed to speak with \nSelby\n about their business, which the bartender was skeptical about as Wilson refused to speak.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nHelmut Zemo\n get a drink\n \n \nWilson was offered Smiling Tiger's usual \ndrink\n, which included the heart of a \nequatroial spitting cobra\n. Much to his own horror and discomfort, Wilson was encouraged by Zemo to indulge the snake heart beverage. However, while they were stood at the bar, Zemo was approached by one of Brass Monkey Saloon's \nhenchmen\n, who explained that Zemo was not welcome there, to which Zemo insisted that he did not have any business with \nPower Broker\n, but suggested that he come talk to him in person. Wilson then watched to his displeasure Barnes pretend to be the \nWinter Soldier\n again to protect Zemo.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson being first introduced to \nSelby\n \n \nShortly, they were granted entry to meet Selby who Zemo talked with about who made the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n. They were interrupted when Wilson's phone rang, and he was forced to put his \nsister\n on speaker. After she said she had to go tend to \nCass\n and then said Wilson's name, Selby ordered them all to be killed, but to Wilson's shock, Selby was killed by a \nsniper\n. Zemo told them to leave immediately and the three ran out, just as bounty hunters started to chase them and fire bullets at them. Wilson complained that he couldn't run in the shoes he was wearing.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is found and saved by \nSharon Carter\n \n \nThe three found themselves saved from the bounty hunters when \nSharon Carter\n stepped out of the shadows and removed her hoodie. Wilson and Barnes told her not to shoot at Zemo who she wanted too, since it was his fault that she had to go into hiding. When asked why she was there, Carter reminded them of her going into hiding after stealing \nCaptain America's Shield\n and the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n. She then agreed to help them and led them to her \napartment\n.\n[\n6\n]\nDeal with Sharon Carter\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is given clothes from \nSharon Carter\n \n \n\"We need your help, Sharon.

You pretending like you can clear my name.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSharon Carter\n[src]\nAt Carter's \napartment\n, Wilson changed from the Smiling Tiger clothing to his regular clothes. He told \nSharon Carter\n about the \nFlag Smashers\n and that they stole vials of \nSuper Soldier Serum\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson making his deal with \nSharon Carter\n \n \nWilson also promised \nher\n that he would get her a pardon so she could return to the \nUnited States of America\n since she was afraid of getting arrested upon returning. Carter told them she had to meet with clients, and Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo went to Carter's party which was filled with people dancing and drinking in a night-club setting. After Carter located \nWilfred Nagel\n, she came and got Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo.\n[\n6\n]\nAmbush at Buccaneer Bay\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson gets ready to go meet \nWilfred Nagel\n \n \n\"And you like living here?!\"\n\"It's not terrible.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSharon Carter\n[src]\nThe following day, Wilson followed \nSharon Carter\n's lead to the Buccaneer Bay shipyard on the outskirts of \nMadripoor\n, with Wilson and \nHelmut Zemo\n agreeing that Madripoor knew how to party, based on the previous night, although Carter warned that there was still a bounty on their heads. Carter led them to a container where \nWilfred Nagel\n seemingly was, giving each of them an earpiece so they could stay in contact, while she would stay outside to keep watch. Zemo led Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n into \nNagel's Laboratory\n. Entering the lab, Wilson and Barnes raised their guns, and soon found Nagel working on the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n, as they turned off his music and surprised him.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson taking \nWilfred Nagel\n as their captive\n \n \nAlthough Nagel tried to force them out, he stopped once he saw Barnes, recognizing him as \nWinter Soldier\n, while Nagel introduced Zemo, noting that Nagel would have heard of Zemo. While Nagel attempted to suggest they make a deal, Carter warned Wilson and the others on the radios that bounty hunters were arriving at the shipyard. Wilson listened as Nagel explained that \nHYDRA\n had recruited him into their \nWinter Soldier Program\n, continuing their work after the \nWinter Soldiers\n had failed to be controlled.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson asks \nWilfred Nagel\n about the \nserum\n \n \nWilson listened to Nagel explained that he had come to Madripoor following the \nBlip\n, where the \nPower Broker\n funded his work, noting that he had created twenty vials of the serum, before \nKarli Morgenthau\n stole them. Once Carter stormed into the lab, warning that they were out of time, Zemo shot Nagel in the chest, killing him before Wilson and Carter took the gun away from him.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson battling against the bounty hunters\n \n \nWithin seconds, a bounty hunter shot the laboratory causing it to explode and Wilson, Barnes, and Carter hit the ground to avoid the blast. After they got back up, they noticed that Zemo had escaped. The three quickly found themselves cornered, but soon saw Zemo on top of a container shooting at the hunters, causing another explosion. Once they could run clear from the bounty hunters, they made their escape, and ran throughout the shipyard.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson in the backseat of the getaway car\n \n \nAfter running throughout the shipyard, Wilson, Barnes, and Carter were shortly met by Zemo who had stolen a getaway car. Wilson asked Carter to join them, but she told him she could not and reminded him to get her a pardon before leaving. When Wilson got in the car, he found himself in the backseat and assumed Barnes wouldn't give him the front, to which he was correct. This was reminiscent of when he didn't give up his front seat for Barnes in \n2016\n. Wilson sat in the back as Zemo drove off away to his \nprivate plane\n.\n[\n6\n]\nJourney to Latvia\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson gets information on \nDonya Madani\n \n \n\"It was sweet of you to defend me at least.\"\n\"Hey, you shut it. No one's defending you. You killed \nNagel\n.\"\n\"Do we really have to litigate what may or may not have happened?\"\n\"There's nothing to litigate. You straight shot the man.\"\n\nHelmut Zemo\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nOn the \nplane\n, Wilson talked with \nJoaqun Torres\n via phone who told him that \nDonya Madani\n had died. Wilson also told \nBucky Barnes\n that he wished that he had not put \nshield\n in the \nmuseum\n, but rather that he destroyed it. After arriving in \nRiga\n, \nLatvia\n, Wilson was left with \nHelmut Zemo\n when Barnes told them that he needed to go check something out and left them.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson discusses the \nFlag Smashers\n \n \nWilson and Zemo went into the building to the room where they would stay in and waited for Barnes to return. Wilson got comfortable in the room, while Zemo took a shower. When Barnes returned, the three discussed their next move in locating the \nFlag Smashers\n. Barnes also told them about the \nDora Milaje\n and how they wanted to arrest Zemo. When Zemo thanked them for defending him, Wilson did not agree that that was exactly correct.\n[\n15\n]\nSearch for Donya Madani\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n in the \nGRC\n camp\n \n \n\"I know I owe you already, but we could use a trustworthy set of eyes on the camp. You got any more tricks in your bag?\"\n\"I may or may not have access to a satellite or two.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSharon Carter\n[src]\nAfter making a plan, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n split up to scout the \nGlobal Repatriation Council\n refugee camp in \nRiga\n to find out about \nDonya Madani\n's funeral but find out that the refugees are sympathizers of the \nFlag Smashers\n. Without getting any knowledge, they met up and found \nHelmut Zemo\n in the camp square and witness him talking to refugee children. After Zemo returned to them, he told them that he knew where to go, so they followed him, but were confused of how he acquired the information. Afterwards, Wilson called \nSharon Carter\n because she had access to satellites. She told him that she would assist him via phone.\n[\n15\n]\nTalks of Peace\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson gets stopped by \nCaptain America\n \n \n\"You're killing innocent people.\"\n\"They're not innocent. They're roadblocks in my journey and I'd kill them again if I had to.\"\nSam Wilson and \nKarli Morgenthau\n[src]\nWhile following \nHelmut Zemo\n through the streets, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n ran into \nCaptain America\n and \nBattlestar\n who demanded to know why Zemo was out of prison. Wilson told Captain America that he wanted to talk with \nKarli Morgenthau\n, noting her vulnerability from losing a loved one. Walker was reluctant, but Battlestar said it was a good idea.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nCaptain America\n make a plan\n \n \nSince Battlestar agreed, Captain America reluctantly did as well so and the group went to the location of the funeral. Once inside, Captain America handcuffed Zemo and told Wilson that he had ten minutes before he did it his way. Wilson then went inside the room and watched the funeral from above, spotting Morgenthau in the crowd.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson speaking with \nKarli Morgenthau\n \n \nFollowing the funeral, Morgenthau stayed behind, having seen Wilson earlier. Wilson approached Morgenthau and asked to speak with her. He listened to what her and the \nFlag Smashers\n' motives were, before saying that he saw their side, but did not agree with how they are achieving their goals. Morgenthau talked to him about her ideals, noting how she only wanted to kill people who were bad. Wilson argued she was still killing innocent people. Morgenthau argued that they were just in her way, and she would kill them again if she had to. Wilson took exception to that statement, but Morgenthau retracted it.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learns \nKarli Morgenthau\n has escaped\n \n \nBefore he can finish his conversation, Captain America barged into the room, threatening to arrest Morgenthau. However, Morgenthau, feeling that Wilson tricked her, kicked him and Captain America back into a table before escaping. Wilson chased after her and regrouped with Barnes, commenting that the building is like a maze. The two eventually found Captain America and an unconscious Zemo.\n[\n15\n]\nSkirmish with the Dora Milaje\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nHelmut Zemo\n discuss the serum\n \n \n\"You might want to fight \nBucky\n before you tangle with the \nDora Milaje\n.\"\nSam Wilson to \nJohn Walker\n[src]\nBack at the room, \nHelmut Zemo\n, who was recovering, asked Wilson if he would ever take the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n, to which Wilson immediately said no. Zemo then said that super soldiers should not exist, and Wilson reminded him that \nBucky Barnes\n was a super soldier and that his statement was not right. The three were met again by \nJohn Walker\n and \nLemar Hoskins\n who barged into their room, demanding Zemo's arrest, and Walker mocked Wilson by putting down the \nshield\n. They were then interrupted by the \nDora Milaje\n, who arrived inside to arrest Zemo also.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson attempting to stop the \nDora Milaje\n \n \nWilson told Walker not to mess with the Dora Milaje after he confronted and watched after Walker and Hoskins began fighting against \nAyo\n, \nNomble\n, and \nYama\n. Shortly, Wilson and Barnes agreed to stop the Dora Milaje from the unnecessary fighting. Wilson managed to grab onto Yama's spear and try to take it away from her to stop the fight, but got thrown to the ground. After the Dora Milaje left having seen that Zemo escaped, Wilson and Barnes left, too, giving Walker a disapproving look.\n[\n15\n]\nFlag Smasher Ambush\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson learning his \nsister\n was threatened\n \n \n\"You have to end this now.\"\n\"I don't want to hurt you, you're just a tool in the regimes I'm looking to destroy.

If I were to kill you, it'd be meaningless.\"\nFalcon and \nKarli Morgenthau\n[src]\nWhile walking in the streets with \nBucky Barnes\n, Wilson received a phone call from his \nsister\n who told him about \nKarli Morgenthau\n's threat and demand that he meet with her. Wilson worriedly told Sarah to get to a safe house with the boys. Wilson looked at his phone and saw a text from Morgenthau, saying he had to meet alone. However, Barnes said he was coming, too.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon arrives to speak to \nKarli Morgenthau\n \n \nThe two arrived at the location, suited up, and Falcon met with Morgenthau, angry that she called his sister. However, after Falcon heard from \nSharon Carter\n over his communications of \nJohn Walker\n's location coinciding with the \nFlag Smashers\n, Wilson took off with his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n. Morgenthau leaped at Barnes, angry that her demands were not met.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon fights against the \nFlag Smashers\n \n \nWhen Wilson arrived at the building, he witnessed a now enhanced \nCaptain America\n throw \nDovich\n into a wall and twist a metal pipe with his own hands. Shocked, Falcon asked him what was going on and Captain America told him they had taken \nBattlestar\n hostage, ignoring the fact that he took the serum.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon witnesses the death of \nBattlestar\n \n \nFalcon followed Captain America into an open courtyard where they were ambushed by the \nFlag Smashers\n. Falcon fought \nDeeDee\n and clipped her with his wing before leaping out of the way of her kick. He then blasted her with his thrusters, sending DeeDee flying. The fight went on as Barnes arrived. He punched \nDiego\n out of the way, telling Falcon he was welcome. Suddenly, Morgenthau punched Battlestar, sending him into a pillar and killing him. Falcon and Barnes turned around to see Walker checking on his friend.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon sees \nCaptain America\n's incident\n \n \nOnce Captain America realized his friend was dead, he went on an angry rampage, and jumped out the building window to capture Morgenthau. Falcon and Barnes left the building to catch up with Walker, and watched as Captain America murdered \nNico\n with the \nshield\n, staining it with Nico's blood. Falcon and Barnes were horrified and watched as the crowd filmed Walker with their devices.\n[\n15\n]\nBattle for the Shield\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon confronts \nJohn Walker\n for the \nshield\n \n \n\"We don't want anyone else to get hurt.

You almost got me.\"\n\"You made a mistake.\"\nSam Wilson and \nJohn Walker\n[src]\nFalcon and \nBucky Barnes\n chased after \nJohn Walker\n and found him in an abandoned warehouse. After confronting him, Falcon finally realized that Walker is both too unhinged and unfit to use the \nshield\n, and told him to hand over the shield, to which Walker refused, saying that he just wanted the shield for himself. Walker claimed that he had to kill \nNico\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon fighting against \nJohn Walker\n \n \nAs Walker warned them that they did not want to take this course of action, Barnes affirmed to him they were serious about getting it back. With Walker refusing, a fight broke out between the three. After Walker momentarily knocked Barnes out, he dueled with Falcon, eventually getting the upper hand and throwing him to the ground. After the shield was thrown out of Walker's grasp, Falcon rushed to get it, only to get tackled violently by Walker.\n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon being attacked by \nJohn Walker\n \n \nWith Falcon overwhelmed, Walker overpowered him tore off Falcon's \nEXO-7 Falcon\n wing. Just as Walker was about to kill Falcon with the shield, Barnes rejoined the fight and tackled Walker, leading him away from Falcon. Barnes tussled with Walker while Falcon regained his bearings. The two then managed to grab onto Walker. Falcon used his jet pack to pull the shield out of Walker's hand, breaking his arm in the process.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson reclaims \nCaptain America's Shield\n \n \nWalker, in pain and enraged, demanded that it was his, and threatened to attack Falcon, holding the shield, but Barnes grabbed him by the legs and Falcon slammed the shield into Walker's back, knocking them all to the ground, but incapacitating Walker. Barnes then knocked Walker out for good measure. As Falcon laid on the ground, exhausted, Barnes dropped the shield next to him, before leaving the warehouse. Falcon looked down at the shield, and tried to wipe the blood off of it, feeling it was his fault.\n[\n14\n]\nPassing the Mantle\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson passes his mantle to \nJoaqun Torres\n \n \n\"All we can do now is sit tight and just chill. Sometimes, there's nothing to do until there's something to do.\"\n\"That's bizarrely wise.\"\n\"Well, I'm a bizarrely wise man, Sam.\"\n\nJoaqun Torres\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nFollowing the fight with \nJohn Walker\n, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n had then met with \nJoaqun Torres\n at the former \nGlobal Repatriation Council\n resettlement camp, who had arrived in \nRiga\n also. After Barnes left them, Torres told Wilson that \nKarli Morgenthau\n was getting more followers and that after Walker's incident, they needed to lay low. Wilson agreed and noticed how Torres seemed interested in his wings. He then showed Torres the \nshield\n. Afterwards, he left and, on his way out, passed on his \nEXO-7 Falcon\n mantle to Torres and left Riga for the \nUnited States of America\n with the shield.\n[\n14\n]\nTough Decisions\n[\n]\nReunion with Isaiah Bradley\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson being reunited with \nEli Bradley\n \n \n\"But you were a Super Soldier like \nSteve\n. You could've been the next...\"\n\"The next? What? Huh? Blond hair, blue eyes, stars and stripes? The entire world's been chasing that great white hope since he first got dosed with that \nserum\n.\"\nSam Wilson and \nIsaiah Bradley\n[src]\nWilson returned to \nBaltimore\n, \nMaryland\n to meet with \nIsaiah Bradley\n again. While walking on the street to Bradley's house, Wilson ran into \nEli Bradley\n who was outside with friends, Eli told him he would be home shortly after asking Wilson what he was doing there.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson meets \nIsaiah Bradley\n in his backyard\n \n \nWilson met Bradley in his backyard, who was watering his plants and started to show him the \nshield\n, but Bradley told him he was not interested and took Wilson inside. After going inside, Wilson sat down with Bradley in the living room, who told him about his past as being a black man who was experimented on with the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson speaking with \nIsaiah Bradley\n inside\n \n \nBradley got emotional while recounting his past stories. He also told Wilson that he believed that no black man would ever have the \nshield\n, even though Wilson couldn't exactly relate to Bradley's stance. After their talk, Wilson left the Bradley's house and once on the street, called his \nsister\n telling her he was coming back to \nLouisiana\n.\n[\n14\n]\nTime With Family\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson returning into \nSarah\n's home\n \n \n\"Aren't you supposed to be off saving the world? Why are you back here bothering me?\"\n\"Because my family's well-being is a part of the world.\"\n\nSarah Wilson\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nOnce back with \nSarah Wilson\n at her house, Sam thought of ways to get the boat ready to be sold. He said goodbye to \nCass\n and \nAJ\n as Sarah told them to feed the neighbors. This made Sam remember how many favors the neighbors owe them. He told Sarah he would cash in those favors. He started calling people around the neighborhood. They were more than happy to help.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n on Wilson's boat\n \n \nIt was successful, as the community soon gathered to help with their boat. Sam thanked \nCarlos\n and \nTommy\n before \nBucky Barnes\n arrived and started helping out right away as well. Barnes then gave Sam a box that he said was a gift from the \nWakandans\n who he had asked to make it for Sam. Sam then watched as Barnes and Sarah met, with Sam teasing Barnes about not flirting with her.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n work on the \nboat\n \n \nAs the day was close to ending, Barnes prepared to leave telling Sam he was going to return home as was going to stay at a hotel in the meantime. However, Sam offered Barnes the chance to stay with them until then, which Barnes agreed to. The next few days, Barnes stayed with Sam and helped him fix the boat. As Sam struggled to fix the boat manually, Barnes would come over every so often and use his \nvibranium arm\n to lift heavy objects with much ease, which Sam was grateful for.\n[\n14\n]\nTraining with Bucky Barnes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson begins to practice using the \nshield\n \n \n\"Feels weird. Picking \nit\n up again. The legacy of that shield is complicated, to say the least.\"\n\"When \nSteve\n told me what he was planning, I don't think either of us really understood what it felt like for a black man to be handed the shield.\"\nSam Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nAfter the \nboat\n was repaired, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n left the docks and began training with the \nshield\n, throwing it back and forth to get used to catching it. While doing so, the two talked and Barnes apologized to Wilson for his initial handling of Wilson handing over the shield to the government. Barnes told him that when and \nSteve Rogers\n had talked the night before Rogers handed over his mantle to Wilson, that they never really fully thought through the implications of handing the shield to a black man and that he understood Wilson's decision. In response, Wilson helped Barnes with truly making peace with his actions as the Winter Soldier and the victims of the Winter Soldier's actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n make a friendship\n \n \nTelling Barnes that he should focus more on helping his victims achieve peace rather than just trying to assuage his own conscious, Barnes agreed with him. As Barnes prepared to leave, the two humorously tried to define their relationship claiming that they were not friends or a team but instead partners and co-workers, then shaking hands and recognizing each other as actually friends, Barnes left for \nNew York City\n.\n[\n14\n]\nAccepting the Mantle\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson talks to his \nsister\n about his decision\n \n \n\"\nIsaiah\n has been to hell and back. If I was in his shoes, I'd probably feel the exact same way. But what would be the point of all the pain and sacrifice if I wasn't willing to stand up and keep fighting.\"\nSam Wilson to \nSarah Wilson\n[src]\nThe next day as Sam and \nSarah Wilson\n prepared the final touches on the boat to sell it, Sarah had a change of heart, much to Sam's delight. Sam then told Sarah that his adventures over the past couple of days had taught him to accept he could not win every battle but that in this case preserving everything of their parents and family history was a fight they simply could not lose. Sam then told Sarah that in the past, he could tell that the more he fought to change the world for the better, the more he knew Sarah believed he was running away from their family.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson finally making his decision\n \n \nHowever, Sarah told him that was untrue and that at no point in her life did she ever believe Sam was running away from them and assured her brother that she has always been proud of him for fighting not only to make the world better but also for their family. Sarah then told Sam that he should not let what \nIsaiah Bradley\n told him deter him from making his own decisions on what to do with the shield. Sam, however, reminded her that Bradley had gone through essentially torture throughout his life and that if in his exact same position, he would probably have the same outlook on life but acknowledged that if he wasn't willing to push through and keeping fighting then all the pain and sacrifices that they have all made would be for nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson throwing and catching the \nshield\n \n \nNow fully ready to accept the mantle that \nSteve Rogers\n had passed on to him,\n[\n14\n]\n Sam spent the next two months training with the shield\n[\n29\n]\n and pushing his body to its absolute potential, doing pushups and running. While he initially struggled with the throwing of the \nshield\n and catching it on the return, eventually, Sam managed to master both. \nAJ\n and \nCass\n looked up at their uncle, happy and proud. AJ then traced the star on the shield, signifying the next step in Sam's life.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson looking at his brand new \nUniform\n \n \nLater on, Wilson got a video-call from \nJoaqun Torres\n. Torres told him got an alert from followers of the \nFlag Smashers\n in \nNew York City\n as Wilson watched the \nWHiH World News\n report of the \nGRC\n voting on the Patch Act that would relocate millions of refugees back to their countries of origin. Wilson realized that \nKarli Morgenthau\n and the Flag Smashers planned on attacking there and so, he prepared to suit up, opening the box from the \nWakandans\n that Barnes had given him, in which was a new Captain America suit and a new pair of wings.\n[\n14\n]\nBecoming Captain America\n[\n]\nSaving the GRC Members\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson arrives inside the \nheadquarters\n \n \n\"I'm sorry, wait, who are you?\"\n\"I'm Captain America.\"\n\"I thought \nCaptain America\n was on the \nmoon\n.\"\nGRC Official and Captain America\n[src]\nBefore he left, Captain America called \nSharon Carter\n asking her for backup. While flying to \nNew York City\n in his new Captain America suit, Captain America joined communications with \nBucky Barnes\n. Nearing the building, Captain America threw the \nshield\n at one of the \nFlag Smashers\n inside the \nGRC New York Headquarters\n. By doing this, the glass window shattered, thus allowing him to get in. Inside, Captain America was then asked by a man who he was, to which he replied, \"I'm Captain America\" and then deduced that evacuating the building was a misdirect.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America fighting \nGeorges Batroc\n \n \nCaptain America then suddenly got hit backwards by a masked man who revealed himself to be \nGeorges Batroc\n. Batroc told him that he still owed him lots of money after the \nRescue\n of Captain \nVassant\n, and then engaged Captain America in a fight. As he was fighting, Captain America remained in communications with Barnes and Carter. When Carter reported that a Flag Smasher was escaping with a helicopter containing GRC hostages, Captain America threw his shield through another glass window, breaking it, and flew out to retrieve it in the air.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America rescues all of the officers\n \n \nCaptain America then saved two \nNYPD\n officers, in a helicopter which had just been damaged. Captain America deployed a newly constructed \nRedwing\n that saved the pilot, and Captain America rescued the other officer. After safely placing them on a road, Captain America flew off to intercept the other helicopter.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America helps \nGRC\n members\n \n \nCaptain America then flew off to the helicopter that contained hostages. He used his new \nRedwing\n drones to find out if any of the members knew how to fly. After finding out that a woman named \nAyla Perez\n did, Captain America sent a message to her phone and told her to put her headphones in. After she did, Captain America told Perez to prepare to get ready to take over the helicopter. Captain America then flew after the helicopter, but was diverted into metal pipes which fell down into the Hudson River below. Captain America fell as well and managed to dodge the pipes as he swam out of the water. Picking up energy, Captain America then flew back and then used the shield to strike \nDiego\n, the Flag Smasher in the control seat and quickly grabbed him out of the helicopter. After a brief struggle with Diego, Captain America dropped him in the Hudson River. He then complimented Perez on managing the helicopter after she successfully landed.\n[\n3\n]\nFinal Fight with Flag Smashers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America rescues the \nGRC\n hostages\n \n \nCaptain America then observed the situation and swooped down to the construction site and used his \nRedwing\n drones to assist him as he stopped the armored truck containing \nGRC\n hostages inside from falling to the ground. He then used the thrusters from his new suit to further help him. After he had made sure the hostages were safe, Captain America then flew back down to the riverbank.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America faces the \nFlag Smashers\n \n \nUsing the shield, Captain America knocked out \nKarli Morgenthau\n and the other \nFlag Smashers\n, before standing alongside \nBucky Barnes\n and \nJohn Walker\n. Morgenthau then took off her Flag Smasher mask and approached Captain America, criticizing him for having taken on the mantle. Captain America told her he was trying something different and that she should as well. They were interrupted when \nGeorges Batroc\n arrived and shot smoke bombs at the ground, allowing for the Flag Smashers to escape. Captain America then led Barnes and Walker deeper into the construction site underneath the building.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America chases the \nFlag Smashers\n \n \nCaptain America, Barnes, and Walker ran through the construction site, trying to find the Flag Smashers, when \nSharon Carter\n called and gave them an update. It was then determined that they would split up to find the Flag Smashers quicker, with Captain America going solo, while Barnes left with Walker.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America confronts \nFlag Smasher\n \n \nAfter hearing a gunshot, Captain America was able to locate where it came from and found \nKarli Morgenthau\n holding a gun at \nSharon Carter\n, who was on the floor and injured. Captain America asked Morgenthau how many more people had to die and what she was willing to do for her goal, getting her to get away from Carter. Morgenthau then engaged in a fight with him, but Captain America was able to dodge and flip his way from her blows, telling her that fighting wasn't the answer, but she had an irrational tantrum and knocked Captain America to the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America comforts \nKarli Morgenthau\n \n \nAfter he was separated from the shield, Morgenthau got out her gun and pointed it at him. Captain America tensed up at the situation and then witnessed Morgenthau double over after getting shot by Carter. Captain America lifted Morgenthau into his arms as she died and heard her tell him that she was sorry. After exchanging glances over the situation with Carter, Captain America left the site and flew down to where the rescued GRC members were, carrying Morgenthau's body.\n[\n3\n]\nPublic Message\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America carrying \nKarli Morgenthau\n \n \n\"Who's in the room with you when you're making those decisions?

You've gotta do better, Senator.\"\nCaptain America to \nGovernment Official\n[src]\nAs Captain America landed with \nKarli Morgenthau\n's body in his arms, the paramedics then rushed over and put Morgenthau's body on a stretcher and took her away to the ambulance. Captain America then walked past news reporters and photographers with some crying out asking what to call him and that the government hadn't approved of him yet. He was then thanked by the \nGovernment Official\n, \nAyla Perez\n, and another GRC member for his role in saving them.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America makes his public message\n \n \nHowever, he then explained to them that they as a whole should do better in helping everyone equally, since the \nBlip\n had affected everyone. He then noted that that was a reason why Morgenthau had started her movement to begin with. The Government Official told him that he did not understand what the GRC did and how it worked, but Captain America laughed and said that he understood. Captain America said he understood now that a black man can take on Captain America mantle and that it didn't matter what he looked like in order to do so. He then told them that they as a governing body had a lot of power. He said that because of this they affected people, so much as that of \nThanos\n and Morgenthau. Captain America then said that all he could do was believe that \nAmerica\n was capable of doing better.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is congratulated by \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nAfter walking away from the GRC members, Captain America saw \nJohn Walker\n and exchanged nods with him. He was then met by \nBucky Barnes\n. Barnes teasingly told him that he hadn't been listening to it and then called him \"Cap\", congratulating him on his speech. Barnes then patted the shield on Captain America's back.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson speaks with \nBarnes\n and \nCarter\n \n \nCaptain America and Barnes then walked over to \nSharon Carter\n, who was leaning against a parked car and was clutching her side where she'd been shot. Captain America told Carter to get medical help, but she said she was okay and didn't need it. Captain America thanked Carter for coming to help them. Carter then told Captain America that she liked his new suit to which he thanked her. Captain America was then asked by a GRC employee to retrieve \nDiego\n, who had been dropped in the river earlier. Before flying away, he told Carter he would still get her the pardon from the U.S. government. He then flew away and picked up the last Flag Smasher, taking him back to the police.\n[\n3\n]\nIsaiah Bradley's Legacy\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson getting rudely greeted by \nEli Bradley\n \n \n\"You ain't no \nMalcolm\n, \nMartin\n, \nMandela\n, but...\"\n\"No argument there. But I know what I've gotta do.\"\n\"So, a black Captain America, huh?\"\n\"Damn right.\"\n\nIsaiah Bradley\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nWilson then returned to \nBaltimore\n, \nMaryland\n, and went back to \nIsaiah Bradley\n's house. He then rang the doorbell to the front door and saw \nEli Bradley\n who looked through the screen door. Eli asked him what he wanted and then called him \"Black Falcon\" with Wilson telling him he needed to learn manners. Eli then told Wilson that Isaiah was out in the backyard. Wilson then saw Isaiah, who walked back to the front yard and commented on how Wilson was still black but not the Falcon anymore.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nIsaiah Bradley\n discuss the title\n \n \nWilson was told by Isaiah that he heard after Wilson's speech the \nGRC\n had called off their vote. Wilson then told Isaiah that even though Isaiah disagreed with his decision, he felt that he needed to protect the \nUnited States of America\n, and explained why he took on the Captain America mantle. Isaiah told him that he wasn't like Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., or Nelson Mandela, to which Wilson agreed. Wilson then told Isaiah to get cleaned up as he wanted to take him somewhere. Eli then walked over and asked where they were going, with Wilson asking him who said he was going.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson showing \nIsaiah Bradley\n the \nexhibit\n \n \nWilson then took Isaiah and Eli to \nWashington, D.C.\n to the \nSmithsonian Institution\n. He then walked them through the updated Captain America exhibit and to another room where a smaller exhibit was on display for Isaiah, showcasing a statue and a memorial plaque. Wilson told Isaiah that now the world wouldn't forget what he did for his country and that he would be learned about. Isaiah, who became deeply emotional, hugged Wilson in gratitude.\n[\n3\n]\nLouisiana Cookout\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson hugs \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"Alright, alright that's enough, real food first.

She ask about me?\"\nSam Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nWilson then returned to \nDelacroix\n. \nLouisiana\n and arrived in time for their community's cookout. He then met with \nSarah\n, \nAJ\n, and \nCass\n. Shortly, \nBucky Barnes\n arrived as well and greeted them, giving Wilson a friendly hug.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson takes pictures with the community\n \n \nWilson then sat down with Barnes, Sarah, and his nephews to enjoy the meal. Since he was the new Captain America, Wilson was asked to have his picture taken by the community. A line was then formed, and he took selfies and pictures with \nCarlos\n, and other members of their community, along with some children.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nBucky Barnes\n at peace\n \n \nAfter the cookout, Wilson and Barnes walked over to the edge of the docks and watched the sun go down. They then smiled, knowing that they were now both at peace and felt good. Wilson then put his arm around Barnes and walked back to join the others.\n[\n3\n]\nReviewing Scott Lang's Book\n[\n]\n\"When the other \nAvengers\n wondered who should write a \nbook\n about us, I knew \nScott\n was the guy.

Wilson said that the book was one of Lang's many surprises and that everyone should read it. The review was featured on the back of the book alongside \nBruce Banner\n's, \nStephen Strange\n's, \nHawkeye\n's and \nChristine Everhart\n's.\n[\n28\n]\nFighting SERPENT\n[\n]\nTheft of the Solar-Battery Drones\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson's speech is interrupted\n \n \nWilson encouraged the creation of \nSolar-Battery Drones\n to help neighborhoods near \nWashington, D.C.\n get power. He attended a festival called Hero Day and delivered a speech alongside the drones. He delivered a speech at the celebration, reminding the children in the audience that one chooses to be a hero and there was no right way to do so other than doing the right thing to do. However, he was interrupted by a group of soldiers with advanced technology. The soldiers stole the guards and ran into the \nSmithsonian Institution\n. Wilson encouraged everyone to stay calm, and warned them of a tree falling on top of them. He used his \nshield\n to push the tree out of the way and ran after the soldiers, leaving his shield behind.\nInside, Wilson caught up with one soldier and defeated them, tying them up and demanding to know who the soldier worked for. However, the soldier simply sneered at him, refusing to answer the question. An explosion went off inside the museum, causing a panic. A group of tourists became trapped on the other side of a gap in the floor, so Wilson took a door and placed it across the gap so that the tourists could walk to safety. Wilson went after another soldier and demanded to know who their \nleader\n was, but the soldier simply said that she worked for a group named \nSERPENT\n as Wilson tied her up as well. Wilson saw an older woman trapped under a fallen display and lifted her out of the wreckage as the woman shouted for her \ndog\n.\nWilson ran to the top of the stairs, demanding to know who the soldiers were. He met the leader of the unit, who shouted that he was trapped without a shield to protect him. Suddenly, a young boy named \nDJ\n shouted for Wilson and rolled his shield over to Wilson. Wilson picked it up and threw it at the soldiers, knocking them all over. Wilson tied the soldiers up and went over to DJ, demanding to know what he was thinking. DJ introduced himself and said that he wanted Wilson to have his shield, believing that Wilson needed the shield to be a hero. Wilson softened and knelt down to DJ, saying that while he respected DJ's need to help someone in danger, what someone looked like did not make them a hero. DJ asked if even someone small could be a hero, so Wilson laughed and showed him the several people DJ had helped while Wilson was focused on SERPENT. Wilson told DJ that they were the ones he saved, and that DJ was a hero that day. Wilson hugged DJ and asked him where DJ got his hoodie. DJ said that he made his hoodie, so Wilson asked DJ to make one, claiming his suit was itchy.\n[\n30\n]\nSkirmish at Catedral de Santo Ramos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America prepares to fight \nSERPENT\n \n \n\"I heard your rib go.

Captain America flew to \nCatedral de Santo Ramos\n and landed in the middle of a group of SERPENT members.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America enters the \ncathedral\n \n \nCaptain America quickly defeated all the mercenaries outside, finishing by using his \nvibranium\n \nwings\n to release a wave of energy. Captain America used \nRedwing\n to locate hostages inside the cathedral, so he rushed inside to rescue them. While fighting several SERPENT members in a hallway, Captain America lost his \nshield\n in the fight, but was able to knock out his enemies. Captain America found the hostages being held at gunpoint, so he used Redwing to neutralize the threats. \nJoaqun Torres\n informed Captain America that the package was getting away, so he allowed Torres to suit up as Falcon to retrieve it.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America fights against \nCopperhead\n \n \nCaptain America found \nSidewinder\n attempting to escape, and threw his shield to stop him. Captain America confronted Sidewinder, who directed Captain America's attention to \nCopperhead\n behind him. Captain America blocked Copperhead's attack, but Copperhead tossed aside the shield. Copperhead commented on Captain America being weaker than \nSteve Rogers\n, and the two fought, with Copperhead gaining the upper hand. Captain America was able to defeat Copperhead, fracturing his arm.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America regroups with \nFalcon\n \n \nThe \nUnited States Navy SEALs\n arrived, led by \nDennis Dunphy\n, to arrest the members of SERPENT. Captain America and Dunphy talked about the failed handoff between SERPENT and the unknown buyer, making them think it was planned. Captain America told Dunphy to keep him updated if they track down Sidewinder before regrouping with Falcon. Captain America joked with Falcon, who asked to meet \nAnt-Man\n and wanted to learn Captain America's aerial kick. Captain America said no to both, claiming that he was not ready, but promised to help him train.\n[\n5\n]\nTraining with Isaiah Bradley\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson introduces \nTorres\n to \nIsaiah Bradley\n \n \n\"You see what's going on out there?

Skilfully dodging Bradley's attacks, Wilson was able to claim two flags, but was knocked down before he could get the last.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson explains working for \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \nWilson was contacted by \nThaddeus Ross\n, which bothered Bradley, who walked away. Wilson spoke with the President, who invited Wilson and Torres to the \nWhite House\n, but Wilson made him extend the invite to Bradley, too. Wilson then went to check on Bradley, who did not like him working for Ross. Wilson explained that working with the President gave people hope, and that he was still cautious due to his history with Ross.

During the drive, the three celebrated being guests of honor. Once they arrived at the White House, Wilson, Torres, and Bradley posed for photos before entering. As the three took a picture together inside, \nLeila Taylor\n approached Wilson to inform him that \nThaddeus Ross\n wanted to speak with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is asked to help rebuild the \nAvengers\n \n \nWilson was taken to the Oval Office, where Ross welcomed him and thanked Wilson for his help retrieving the canister from \nSERPENT\n. Ross then revealed that he wanted Wilson to help him reform the \nAvengers\n. Wilson was taken aback, as Ross had previously tried to dismantle the Avengers with the \nSokovia Accords\n. Ross explained that he had a change of heart and now appreciated the Avengers' work, and told Wilson to think about it.

Ross then commenced the summit, where he announced the discovery of \nadamantium\n discovered on \nCelestial Island\n and how it could help the \nworld\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson tells \nIsaiah Bradley\n to surrender\n \n \nSuddenly, Bradley stood up, attacked an agent, stole his gun, and shot at Ross. Wilson rushed over and disarmed Bradley, who grabbed Wilson by the throat and threw him aside. As Wilson subdued other agents that began attacking, he spotted \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n aim at Bradley, so Wilson knocked her gun away to stop her from killing him. Wilson chased after Bradley outside of the White House until he stopped, not knowing what happened. Wilson told Bradley to surrender to not make things worse, and he watched as Bradley was arrested.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is dismissed from the investigation\n \n \nWilson forced his way down to the \nPEOC\n to speak with Ross, who ordered everyone else out of the room. They were joined by Bat-Seraph, who Ross introduced Wilson to, and the two argued over Bradley's actions. Ross stopped them and Wilson explained that Bradley did not appear to be in control. Wilson wanted to investigate, but Ross turned him down, stating that he was too close to the case and that his proposal was no longer valid.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson argues with \nLeila Taylor\n about \nRoss\n \n \nAfter giving the investigation to Bat-Seraph, Ross told Wilson that he should not even be dealing with situations like this, as he was not \nSteve Rogers\n. Wilson was thrown off by Ross' dismissal of him and was told that he was now done. Wilson stormed out in frustration and was followed by \nLeila Taylor\n. Wilson stated that he was going to clear Bradley's name on his own, but Taylor replied that he needed Ross on his side, although Wilson was adamant that Ross was only ever on his own side. Taylor told Wilson not to make things harder for himself, but Wilson was determined to help Bradley and left.\n[\n5\n]\nQuestioning Isaiah Bradley\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson asks \nIsaiah Bradley\n what happened\n \n \n\"I'm gonna die in \nhere\n.\"\n\"No you're not. I'm gonna get you out.\"\n\nIsaiah Bradley\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nThe next day, Wilson went to visit \nIsaiah Bradley\n in \nprison\n, which he was able to do with \nPayumo\n's help. Wilson asked Bradley if he tried to kill \nThaddeus Ross\n, so he answered that he did not and had no idea what happened. After retelling the events before the attack, Bradley told Wilson get involved. Wilson promised to get Bradley's name cleared, but Bradley told Wilson that if he wanted to help, he should not come back.\n[\n5\n]\nAttacked by Sidewinder\n[\n]\n\"You're desperate without your \ngear\n.\"\n\"Nope. Just a little meaner.\"\n\nSidewinder\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nWhile driving, Wilson contacted \nJoaqun Torres\n, who had hacked into the \nWhite House\n's CCTV system. Remembering \nWinter Soldier\n's trigger words, Wilson told Torres to check for anyone talking to Bradley. Torres spotted Bradley's phone flashing at him, as well as the other shooters. Wilson brought up the \nfight\n with \nSERPENT\n, speculating that the \nbuyer\n wanted Wilson to show up, which would lead to him inviting Bradley to the White House. \nWilson ended the call by telling Torres to look into \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n. Wilson was suddenly fired at by \nSidewinder\n, so he quickly exited his car right before Sidewinder destroyed it with a grenade. While Sidewinder was distracted shooting at the police, Wilson rushed at him. The two began to fight, with Sidewinder stabbing Wilson in the chest and abdomen. Wilson was able to kick Sidewinder down and told him to connect him with his buyer so he could resolve their conflict.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson is repeatedly shot at by \nSidewinder\n \n \nSidewinder pointed out that the buyer knew Wilson would try to talk him down, and instead shot at Wilson, causing him to retreat. Wilson managed to throw Sidewinder's axe at him, allowing him to run into \nAaron's Salvage Yard\n. Wilson poured bleach on a car battery, creating acidic fumes to distract Sidewinder, who commented on Wilson being desperate without his \ngear\n. Wilson kicked Sidewinder into a car, defeating him, and replied that he was just meaner without it. Sidewinder's phone then rang, so Wilson answered it and briefly spoke with the buyer.\n[\n5\n]\nGoing Rogue\n[\n]\n\"\nRoss\n told me to stay out of this.\"\n\"Eh, he's just the President of the \nUnited States\n.\"\nSam Wilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n[src]\nWilson returned to his office and informed \nJoaqun Torres\n of his \nrun-in\n with \nSidewinder\n. As Torres traced the last call on Sidewinder's phone, he told Wilson that \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n was a former \nBlack Widow\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson decides to disobey \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \nWilson reviewed the footage from the \nWhite House\n and realized that \nIsaiah Bradley\n could have killed \nThaddeus Ross\n but did not, although he was not sure why. Torres traced the call to \nCamp Echo One\n, which Wilson figured was a military prison. Deciding to go against the President's orders, Wilson packed a new \ncostume\n, as his previous one being damaged, grabbed his \nshield\n, and got ready to leave. Wilson told Torres he did not have to join, but Torres went along with him.\nWilson and Torres drove to \nWest Virginia\n, where the heard the news that the other shooters from the White House were all \nkilled\n in their cells. Torres wondered if they should turn back, but Wilson knew that Bradley was put in danger by the buyer as bait as they were getting closer towards uncovering the buyer's plot. Wilson remained determined to keep driving so that they could find out who the buyer was.\n[\n5\n]\nInfiltration into Camp Echo One\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nTorres\n arrive at \nCamp Echo One\n \n \n\"Well, \nwhatever you're doing\n, you're hurting a lot of people, including my \nfriend\n. So this is the last chance I'm gonna give you to stop it.\"\n\"Why are you protecting \nhim\n? Ross knows I'm responsible for the \nWhite House\n, yet he's still letting Isaiah sit in \nprison\n for it.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSamuel Sterns\n[src]\nWilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n arrived outside of \nCamp Echo One\n and stealthily made their approach, with Wilson bringing his \nshield\n. With the assistance of \nRedwing\n looping the surveillance, Wilson and Torres made their way to the entrance and got inside without being detected.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson searches inside of \nCamp Echo One\n \n \nWilson and Torres went down the elevator and searched the area, but found it empty. They reached a lab, and Wilson found a room with several medical records on the wall, including one of \nIsaiah Bradley\n. Wilson then discovered a file on \nThaddeus Ross\n and a container of \npills\n. Torres discovered that flashing lights planted commands in Bradley and the others, which could be triggered by the \nMr. Blue\n song. Wilson then watched a recording of \nSamuel Sterns\n giving a seminar.\nWilson and Torres were joined by Sterns, who Wilson determined was the buyer. Wilson asked Sterns why he wanted to kill Ross, so Sterns revealed that Ross had imprisoned him without a trial and exposed him to \ngamma radiation\n, which heavily mutated him. Sterns further explained that he helped Ross become President, and that he did not want Ross dead. Wilson warned Sterns to stop his plans, but Sterns told Wilson that Ross was aware Bradley was innocent but had done nothing about it.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson fights the mind controlled soldiers\n \n \nWhen Wilson went to attack Sterns, he was hit with a strong pulse directly above him, which stopped him from moving. Sterns turned off the pulse and a group of mind controlled soldiers arrived, allowing Sterns to escape. Wilson and Torres fought against the soldiers, but became overwhelmed. They were able to neutralize the soldiers and chased after Sterns, only to be stopped by more soldiers. \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n arrived, and they worked together to defeat the soldiers.\nAs they exited the prison, Wilson filled Bat-Seraph on what they learned from Sterns and asked why she was now helping them. Bat-Seraph answered that it was because Wilson was right. They were then surrounded by \nFBI\n agents who placed Wilson and Torres under arrest for trespassing. The \nMr. Blue\n song started playing, which put the agents under mind control. Wilson, Torres, and Bat-Seraph quickly ran for their car and drove away before they could be killed by the agents.\n[\n5\n]\nInterrogating Sidewinder\n[\n]\n\"So \nSterns\n hired you to steal \nJapan\n's \nadamantium\n knowing it would divide the two \ncountries\n.\"\n\"He paid us through a \nCIA\n black fund.\"\n\"That could kill the treaty and start a war.\"\nSam Wilson and \nSidewinder\n[src]\nThe trio drove to \nNorfolk\n, where they met up with \nDennis Dunphy\n and his team, as they were the only people Wilson trusted after \nThaddeus Ross\n put out an order for their arrest. Wilson gave Dunphy the \npills\n he found at \nCamp Echo One\n and told him to get them analyzed. Wilson then went to speak with \nSidewinder\n, and told \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n to listen in on their conversation.\nWilson asked Sidewinder what he learned from \nSamuel Sterns\n, which he agreed to divulge for a reduced sentence, so Wilson asked to hear his intel first. Wilson learned that Ross had been using Sterns' mind for years, promising to release him, but never did. Wilson then figured out that Sterns planned to start a war that would blame Ross. Before Wilson left, Sidewinder promised that he would break out and get revenge on him. Wilson told the others they needed to warn Ross, who was at \nCelestial Island\n, as were \nJapan\n's warships.\n[\n5\n]\nConfronting President Ross\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson arrives onboard the \nUSS Milius\n \n \n\"I know what it's like... to feel you have somethin' to prove. Everyone only seeing one thing. But when showing there's more to you, it's not about when times are easy. It's about moments like this.\"\nSam Wilson to \nThaddeus Ross\n[src]\nWilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n suited up and flew to the \nUSS Milius\n, followed by \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n, who insited on talking to \nThaddeus Ross\n to ensure that he would listen to them. They grouped up with \nLeila Taylor\n, who revealed that Ross was in a volatile state, so Wilson commented that they should hurry as \nSamuel Sterns\n' plan would soon begin.\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson and \nThaddeus Ross\n discuss \nLeader\n \n \nThey found Ross, so Wilson revealed that he had recovered intel at \nCamp Echo One\n and that they both knew \nIsaiah Bradley\n was innocent. Ross took Wilson to a private room to talk, and Wilson explained that Sterns was trying to pit Ross and \nJapan\n against each other. Wilson then brought up the possibility of Ross being mind controlled, revealing the records he found. Wilson pushed, causing Ross to reveal that he was dying and Sterns saved his life, and that he wanted to show his \ndaughter\n that he had changed. Wilson understood Ross' struggle to show more of himself, and stated that he needed to not play into Sterns' manipulation.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle of Celestial Island\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America and \nFalcon\n are deployed\n \n \n\"We gotta get our birds in the air.\"\n\"You have \ntwo\n ready to fly now, sir.\"\n\nThaddeus Ross\n and Captain America\n[src]\nThe two were interrupted and informed that two of their F-18s fired on the \nJapanese\n fleet, so Captain America told \nThaddeus Ross\n that he and \nFalcon\n could deal with the rogue pilots. Ross approved and Captain America and Falcon rushed outside and took to the sky, with Captain America instructing Falcon to not get killed.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America and \nFalcon\n fly into battle\n \n \nCaptain America and Falcon flew to the Japanese pilots and told them to turn back, as it was not them attacking but \nLeader\n, but they were ignored. Captain America witnessed \nJackal\n fired upon the Japanese fleet, so he told Ross not to send more jets to show the Japanese that they were deescalating the situation. After stopping missiles from hitting the \nUnited States\n' fleet, Captain America told Ross to convince \nOzaki\n to pull back his forces.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America saves the \nJapanese\n fleet\n \n \nUsing his \nvibranium\n \nwings\n, Captain America sliced through \nWhiskey\n's jet, and Falcon got him to safety. Despite trying to help, the Japanese jets still chased after them, so Captain America flew around \nCelestial Island\n to hide. When Jackal fired his last missiles, Falcon went to destroy them, but Captain America told him to not. Falcon ended up getting hit by the missile and crashed into the ocean. Determined to end the fight, Captain America removed Jackal from his jet and stopped it from crashing into the Japanese fleet.\n[\n5\n]\nDoubting Himself\n[\n]\n\"I had \nSterns\n right in my hands. And he got away. He damn near pushed us to the brink of war, because I wasn't...\"\n\"Say what you need to say.\"\n\"\nSteve\n made a mistake.\"\nSam Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nJoaqun Torres\n was rushed to surgery and was in critical condition. Wilson watched as Torres was operated on from the viewing room, where he was joined by \nBucky Barnes\n. Wilson admitted that he was glad to see Barnes, and the two hugged. Wilson spoke about Torres' condition, which Barnes tried to assure Wilson was not his fault.\nWilson asked about how many times \nSteve Rogers\n stopped an alien invasion, expressing doubt in how he could follow his legacy. Wilson then voiced his regret about not taking the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n, as he felt overwhelmed by what he had to deal with and claimed that Rogers made a mistake choosing him as Captain America. Barnes assured Wilson that he was chosen because he gave people something to aspire towards. Wilson thanked Barnes for his words. \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n joined Wilson and. they overheard a news report on \nIsaiah Bradley\n facing a possible death sentence.\n[\n5\n]\nDuel of Washington, D.C.\n[\n]\n\"Ross. We both know you can take me out with one punch, but I don't think you wanna do that. I know you've done some terrible things. Now, I might be crazy... but I think you're trying to change. Now's the time to prove it to the \nworld\n. Prove it to \nBetty\n.\"\nCaptain America to \nRed Hulk\n[src]\nOutside, Wilson was confronted by \nLeader\n, who stated that Wilson ruined his plans, and that he was now forced to turn himself in to get what he wanted. Wilson revealed that he knew Leader wanted to destroy \nThaddeus Ross\n' legacy using the \npills\n. Soldiers arrived to arrest Leader, as he revealed his intention to turn Ross into a monster. Wilson walked away, and Leader claimed that Wilson would die if he tried to stop Ross.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America lures \nRed Hulk\n away\n \n \nCaptain America suited up and flew to the \nWhite House\n, where Ross had transformed into Red Hulk and went on a rampage. Red Hulk attacked Captain America, who tried to evade him, but Red Hulk too fast and strong. Red Hulk grabbed Captain America and crashed him into the White House. On the rooftop, Captain America saved a group of soldiers who tried to fight Red Hulk. Captain America lured Red Hulk to Hains Point, which had been evacuated by \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America faces off against \nRed Hulk\n \n \nCaptain America and Red Hulk stood at opposite ends, and Captain America attempted to get Red Hulk to calm down by remembering taking his \ndaughter\n to see the cherry blossoms. When that failed, Captain America equipped his \nshield\n and prepared to fight. Red Hulk charged at Captain America, so he jumped over and sliced Red Hulk's back with his \nwings\n. Red Hulk destroyed \nRedwing\n and savagely beat down Captain America, who blocked the punches with his shield. After having his shield taken away, Red Hulk grabbed Captain America's jetpack and ripped off one of his wings.\nRed Hulk then grabbed Captain America by the head and started to crush his helmet. Noticing a blade from his wings sticking out of Red Hulk, Captain America kicked it in further to free himself. Captain America reclaimed his shield and charged up his remaining wing, which he plunged into Red Hulk's stomach. A giant wave of energy was released, which buried Captain America under rubble. Captain America was found by Bat-Seraph and \nLeila Taylor\n, who helped him up. \n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America witnesses \nRed Hulk\n get up\n \n \nCaptain America witnessed Red Hulk get back up, making him say to himself that he should have taken the \nserum\n, despite \nBucky Barnes\n' words. Captain America stood in front of Red Hulk and made one final attempt to calm him down, telling him to prove that he was trying to change for his \ndaughter\n. Captain America's words worked, and Red Hulk transformed back into Ross. Afterwards, Captain America spoke to Bat-Seraph, who informed him that Leader had been taken to the \nRaft\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIsaiah Bradley's Release\n[\n]\n\"I told you I'd get you out.\"\n\"Took you so long?\"\nSam Wilson and \nIsaiah Bradley\n[src]\nWilson was advised to go to the hospital by \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n, but he wanted to first get \nIsaiah Bradley\n out of prison. Wilson greeted Bradley as he was released, tapping him on the back, calling back to their training session. The two then hugged, with Wilson warning Bradley about his broken bones.\n[\n5\n]\nVisiting Thaddeus Ross\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson speaks to \nThaddeus Ross\n in the \nRaft\n \n \n\"We're on different sides of this thing every step of the way.\"\n\"Look, if we can't see the good in each other, we've already lost the fight.\"\n\nThaddeus Ross\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nWilson, now with his arm in a sling, traveled to the \nRaft\n to visit \nThaddeus Ross\n in his cell. Wilson and Ross discussed the conditions of the Raft, before Wilson explained that the \ngamma radiation\n in the \npills\n had built up over the years in Ross' body, which caused him to become Red Hulk.\nWilson commended Ross for taking responsibility for stepping down as President of the \nUnited States\n and accepting his sentence. Wilson informed Ross that \nJapan\n upheld their end of the treaty, which led to the creation of the \nOzaki-Ross Accords\n. Ross wondered why Wilson was visiting him despite opposing each other, but Wilson stated that they needed to see the good in each other. Wilson then left when \nBetty Ross\n arrived to visit her father.\n[\n5\n]\nReassembling the Avengers\n[\n]\nChecking on Joaqun Torres\n[\n]\n\"Because if I'm not on point... I feel like I let down everyone else who was fightin' for a seat at that table. That's pressure, man. It weighs on you. Makes you wonder if you'll ever just be... enough.\"\nSam Wilson to \nJoaqun Torres\n[src]\nWhen \nJoaqun Torres\n came out of surgery, Wilson went to visit him in the hospital. Wilson ran into \nIsaiah Bradley\n in the hallway, and Bradley revealed that he was meeting up with \nRuth Bat-Seraph\n, which made Wilson joked about the two of them being grumpy.\nWilson entered Torres' room and sat beside his bed. Torres apologized for messing up, comparing himself with Wilson, who he claimed never messed up. Wilson told Torres that he had to always be on point so that he did not let anyone down, and that the pressure always made him question if he was enough. Torres then talked about his upbringing, and how he idolized Wilson because he never gave up. Wilson taught Torres how to do his aerial kick, and told him to be ready, as he had decided to rebuild the \nAvengers\n.\n[\n5\n]\nLeader's Warning\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nWilson recieves a warning from the \nLeader\n \n \n\"I'm not in the mood for your jokes. You killed a lot of good men trying to get your revenge. Trust me, we don't share the same sense of humor.\"\n\"We share the same \nworld\n, don't we? This world you would die to save? It's coming.\"\nSam Wilson and \nLeader\n[src]\nWhen his arm had healed, Wilson visited \nLeader\n in the \nRaft\n, taunting him for being wrong about \nThaddeus Ross\n. Wilson listened as Leader revealed that he had seen in the probabilities \nother worlds\n that existed, and that all the heroes of their \nworld\n would need to protect it from the others when they came.\n[\n5\n]\nTrademark Dispute\n[\n]\n\"Weren't you going to talk to him?\"\n\"I already did.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"It went poorly.\"\n\nYelena Belova\n and \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nWilson was still in the process of assembling the \nAvengers\n when a team known as the \nNew Avengers\n were announced to the world. Fourteen months later, Wilson came into conflict with the team over use of the Avengers name, feeling as though he had ownership over the name. \nBucky Barnes\n, a member of the New Avengers, visited Wilson to discuss the situation, but it went poorly. With the support of the public behind him, Wilson filed for copyright over the Avengers name.\n[\n31\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"The fight you taking on ain't gonna be easy, Sam.\"\n\"Yeah, I might fail. Shit, I might die. But... We built this \ncountry\n. Bled for it. I'm not gonna let anybody tell me I can't fight for it. Not after what everybody before me went through. Including you.\"\n\nIsaiah Bradley\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nSam Wilson is one of \nSteve Rogers\n' most stalwart friends and allies. Both men found a kindred spirit in each other when they discovered they both shared common life experiences and had similar values. Sam Wilson and Rogers both fought for the \nUnited States of America\n by joining the \nmilitary\n, had to cope with the deaths of friends during war, and had to adjust to life outside of war. For Wilson, he found purpose in helping military veterans adjust to civilian life. This earned Rogers' respect, and in turn Wilson admires Captain America and the ideals he represents. Their commonality helped the two to forge a bond that led Wilson to aid Steve Rogers in many of his heroic exploits. During these exploits, Sam Wilson becomes a hero in his own right, whether it be when the two are fighting shoulder to shoulder together during a mission to save the world or aiding Rogers with a personal matter, such as helping him find \nWinter Soldier\n.\nIn contrast to Rogers' pensive no-nonsense attitude, Wilson often displays a more brazen attitude and a strong sense of humor, often making cheeky comments; he jokingly tells Rogers to come by the VA to make him look good in front of a woman at the desk, and nods in approval when Rogers and \nSharon Carter\n kiss. However, similarly to Rogers, Wilson is also a hardened Airman who, during battle, believes strongly in focusing on the job at hand, bluntly telling \nSpider-Man\n that during fights people do not tend to talk much when his adversary started admiring his EXO-suit. Some of Wilson's hardened attitude comes from losing his wingman, Riley, which led to him leaving the military. In addition, he also takes great pride in his work, both when he helps veterans who suffer from PTSD and his work as Falcon, and is visibly embarrassed following his defeat at the hands of \nAnt-Man\n, though later jokes about this at their next encounter.\nHe respects \nScott Lang\n following their initial meeting despite much of the public believing him to be nothing more than a common criminal, and following their \nbattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n is the only one of Rogers' captured teammates who does not show any ill will toward \nTony Stark\n when he visits his former teammates and admits to Wilson that he was wrong, suggesting the two of them both understand why the other did what they did and still hold some mutual respect for one another.\nWilson also shares many characteristics and similarities to his friend and mentor Steve Rogers. He is able to understand and relate to the motivations and frustrations of \nFlag Smasher\n, stating that he supports the noble nature of her cause, but that he cannot support her violent ways. Wilson firmly believes that violence does not make the world a better place, to which Morgenthau suggests that he is either brilliant or hopelessly optimistic. Despite \nBaron Zemo\n's constant efforts to convince Wilson that the only way to stop the \nFlag Smashers\n is by killing Morgenthau, Wilson stands firm by his beliefs that the group can be stopped peacefully. Upon finding out that Sharon Carter was still in hiding for helping Wilson, Rogers and Barnes during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Wilson is deeply stricken and appalled by what she had to experience, promising that he will personally make sure that she gets pardoned for her crimes.\nDue to his previous occupation as a counselor at the VA, Wilson serves as a good advisor and a motivational speaker, being able to understand and help Bucky Barnes with his mental struggles and trauma, giving him a few helpful advises on how he should be making amends for his past crimes. Wilson's understanding nature has helped evolve his initial rivalry with Barnes into friendship. Despite not initially agreeing with \nIsaiah Bradley\n's beliefs about the legacy of \nCaptain America's Shield\n, Wilson was still deeply stricken by Bradley's tragic history, even going as far as briefly entertaining the thought of destroying the shield. However, after learning about the importance of the shield and its legacy during the conversation with Bucky Barnes, Wilson's mind about the shield has changed. So much so, that he willingly took the shield and became the new Captain America in hopes of bettering his country. Wilson has a deep connection to his family's legacy, constantly trying to convince \nSarah Wilson\n not to sell their old family boat, despite their ever-increasing financial troubles, firmly believing that things like legacy, history and righteous causes are worth fighting for.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"I can fly.\"\nFalcon to \nBucky Barnes\n[src]\nEXO-7 Falcon\n Capabilities\n: Although Wilson does not possess any innate powers, he is granted several abilities through his use of the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n, which he uses to great effect.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: The wings were originally composed of a carbon fibre that protected Wilson from gunfire. The vibranium version of the suit enhance Wilson's durability to superhuman levels, as shown during his fight with \nRed Hulk\n.\nSuperhuman Speed\n: With the thrusters on Wilson's wings, he could reach very fast speeds. He was able to almost catch up to \nWar Machine\n in the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n and could also easily fly past many flying vehicles, including a plane in the \nRescue of Captain Vassant\n and also a helicopter in the \nAttack on the GRC\n. The Captain America iterations of Wilson's suit include flight helmet that enables Wilson to fly in the upper atmosphere and at supersonic speeds, notably breaking the sound barrier during the dogfight against American and Japanese fighter pilots in the \nBattle of Celestial Island\n. He has also used his ability to create sonic booms from his speed as an offensive attack, creating one while rapidly descending and then landing, getting his enemies' attention before the boom followed Wilson to the ground, knocking every other individual back.\nSuperhuman Agility\n: Wilson could also maneuver in the air to dodge incoming attacks from his enemies. He could also easily flip in the air by retracting his wings and then deploying them again to fly away. When getting chased by missiles, Wilson retracted his wings to flip downwards in order to have the missiles hit the oncoming \nHelicarrier\n. He was also able to wrap his wing around him, so he produced enough force to hit the back of a helicopter to ground it.\nSuperhuman Stamina\n: The suit worn by Wilson granted him increased stamina. This stamina allowed him to fly through the air without having to use a lot of energy to do so.\nSuperhuman Reflexes\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon dodging many missiles\n \n \n Along with agility, Wilson could dodge many obstacles while using the wings. He dodged many missiles and gun fire coming from his behind by maneuvering through the air. He was also able to notice \nVision\n's beam firing at him from behind and flipped out of the way.\nEnhanced Vision\n: The EXO-7's \nCombat Goggles\n allow Wilson to view multiple spectrum and see objects that are either too far away or too small to be seen by the naked eye. His upgraded goggles from the \nWakandan Design Group\n allow him to see heat signatures as well as footprints. He was even able to detect \nAnt-Man\n in his shrunken form running among the grass.\nFlight\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America flying over New York City\n \n \n Using his \nspecialized winged jetpack\n, Sam Wilson is able to fly at high speeds with an enhanced degree of maneuverability and agility similar to that of an actual falcon. The impressive agility afforded by the jetpack and his own knowledge on flying enabled him to avoid automatic fire from an Insight \nQuinjet\n and the shots of the Insight \nHelicarriers\n' main weaponry. While flying, he was able to lift up and carry off people like \nJasper Sitwell\n and \nSteve Rogers\n. With his \nvibranium suit\n, Wilson was able to support and lift a truck with multiple people inside with the use of his thrusters and can fly into the upper atmosphere with his nanotech flight helmet.\nKinetic Energy Absorption\n: Based on the \nPanther Habit\n, Wilson's new wings from the \nWakandan Design Group\n have the ability to absorb and redistribute kinetic energy. As it collects energy from incoming sources, the wings give off a purple glow in parallel to the amount of accumulated energy. Wilson can release the energy from his wings by striking them in a single spot, releasing it as an energy pulse from the point of impact. During the \nSkirmish at Catedral de Santo Ramos,\n Wilson collected enough energy from SERPENT gunfire to release a pulse wave back at them powerful enough to knock them all out. Wilson can also use this accumulated energy to augment his existing attacks, releasing a wave whilst slicing through a fighter jet during the \nBattle of Celestial Island\n, destroying the jet. During Wilson's \nduel\n against Red Hulk, he allowed himself to take a large amount of damage from the rampaging Hulk, enabling his wings to absorb as much energy as possible. The resulting assault led to one of the wings getting ripped off, but Wilson was used the remaining wing, glowing almost completely purple with the immense amount of energy stored within it, to stab Red Hulk in the abdomen before releasing a massive energy wave. The wave emitted a shockwave so large it shook the entire garden around them and knocked both Wilson and the Red Hulk out.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.\"\n\"I'm more of a soldier than a spy.\"\n\nNick Fury\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nMaster Pilot\n: Wilson displays the utmost skill when flying with his EXO wings; he is capable of performing many advanced and complicated maneuvers while in midair, without losing focus on his objectives, targets, or pursuers. He can also pilot aircraft such as the \nQuinjet\n. Even before obtaining the wings, he was a master pilot with planes. Prior to becoming an \nAvenger\n, Wilson flew planes in the \nUnited States Air Force\n.\nMaster Martial Artist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nCaptain America fighting \nBatroc the Leaper\n \n \n As a member of the \nUnited States Air Force\n, Wilson is a highly skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. Wilson's fighting style include a combination of firearm improvisation, flight maneuvers such as swooping and aerial grappling, and modern army combatives. Wilson was able to subdue \nHYDRA\n operatives and go up against \nSTRIKE\n leader \nBrock Rumlow\n, though Rumlow had the upper hand. He momentarily holds his own against Winter Soldier before instantly getting defeated by the latter. He was later able to defeat several members of \nLAF\n. He was also capable of fighting several enhanced \nFlag Smashers\n and \nDora Milaje\n, briefly combating \nNomble\n unarmed. He also defeated the very skilled \nGeorges Batroc\n. He is also able to constantly floor the \nFlag Smasher\n with his jet pack assisted powerful kicks. Wilson is even able to utilize his flight is his fighting as well. When moving at high speeds, Wilson is capable of utilizing his momentum and weight to generate large amounts of force, such as when he threw a helicopter off course to prevent it from shooting \nBucky Barnes\n, knocked back Iron Man during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, sending \nProxima Midnight\n flying into a store front during the \nAttack on Vision\n, slamming a \nChitauri Gorilla\n to the ground, or flooring \nKarli Morgenthau\n with a powerful kick.\nShield Mastery\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nWilson fighting \nFlag Smasher\n with his \nshield\n \n \n Wilson is highly skilled at using \nCaptain America's shield\n in combat, having trained with the shield in order to become Captain America. He can ricochet the shield in a way it returns to his grip. He was able to consistently throw it at the \nFlag Smashers\n to knock them down, and usually using his shield combined with capabilities of his EXO-7 Falcon. He was also proficient in close combat with the shield, he managed to use the shield to successfully push back \nGeorges Batroc\n, and able to use it to effectively block and launch attacks on his own, which he used to defend himself from Morgenthau. Wilson's abilties with the shield have continued to improve during his tenure as Captain America, showcasing his creativity by performing a flying kick, launching the shield and successfully knocking down multiple assailants at \nCamp Echo One\n whilst rescuing \nTorres\n. He also uses the shield in combination with his Vibranium wings to great avail. In his initial assault against \nSERPENT\n, Wilson threw the shield at a target and instead of catching it when it returned, used his wings as bracers to redirect the shield to knock out the remaining SERPENT agents.\nMaster Marksman\n: Wilson is a highly trained marksman, as he has shown great accuracy with his retractable sidearms and U.S. military firearms. During the \nBattle\n of \nWakanda\n, Falcon shot down numerous Outriders from mid-air. \nSteve Rogers\n admitted that if he had known the \nAttack\n on the \nHYDRA Research Base\n would become a firefight, he would have requested his services. Wilson has also shown himself apt with being able to throw Rogers' shield with great accuracy.\nMaster Acrobat\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon kicking at \nCrossbones\n' mercenaries\n \n \n Wilson is a highly trained acrobat capable of withstanding constant equilibrium shifting during flight. Many times during his battle with \nHYDRA\n, Wilson had to couple his acrobatic skills with his flight maneuvers to avoid being shot down from the sky. While training with the Shield, he was able to become more skilled, later using his acrobatic abilities during his fight with \nFlag Smasher\n.\n\"Alright, Sam. What's the play?\"\n\"We need a diversion. Something \nbig\n.\"\n\nCaptain America\n and Falcon\n[src]\nExpert Tactician\n: Wilson has shown capabilities in planning special operations, as he was able to help \nCaptain America\n and his team strategize the plan to destroy the Insight Helicarriers and unmask HYDRA. Wilson was able to react and respond to \nAnt-Man\n's unprecedented appearance and was able to counter his unique attacks after only viewing them momentarily. During the \nClash\n of the \nAvengers\n, Wilson understood that not everyone would make it out of the airport, and Rogers consulted him for a strategy, to which Wilson quickly replied with a big diversion.\n\"I've been working with the Air Force for six months now. Every time ops touches \nhim\n, he gets all glitchy.\"\n\"Well, you know, those poor techs can't keep up with a billion returning IP addresses and your sick-ass Stark-level tech.\"\nSam Wilson and \nJoaqun Torres\n[src]\nExpert Engineer\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nWilson repairing damage done to \nRedwing\n \n \n Wilson has shown himself to be a capable electrical and mechanical engineer. He regularly performs maintenance on his \nwingsuit\n and recalibrates \nRedwing\n's sensors in-between missions. Wilson's remarked that he doesn't trust anyone else to repair his wings because they always make a mistake. He is also a capable mechanic, as he is able to perform maintenance on his family's boat.\n\"He knows Arabic. Wait, can you say that again? Hold on a sec.\"\n\nJoaqun Torres\n to Sam Wilson\n[src]\nMultilingualism\n: Wilson is fluent in his native English, as well as Arabic, French, Spanish, and Japanese.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nWeapons\n[\n]\nTwin Steyr SPPs\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon shooting his dual pistols at \nThanos\n \n \n Falcon carries two of these machine pistols in the holsters of his \nEXO-7 Suit\n. The mechanical aids in Falcon's forearms provide speedy upholstering and assembly of the machine pistols. He used them against \nQuinjets\n and crew members during an assault on the \nProject Insight\n \nHelicarriers\n. He also resorted to using them to defend the \nAvengers Compound\n from \nAnt-Man\n when he infiltrated the compound, attempting to shoot at him believing the intruder was hostile. In their mission to stop \nBrock Rumlow\n in \nLagos\n, Wilson used his guns to confront Rumlow's mercenaries inside the \nIFID Headquarters\n. While on the run, he used them to threaten \nProxima Midnight\n and \nCorvus Glaive\n by holding them at gunpoint and later fired them as a last resort at \nThanos\n. He stopped using the twin guns following the \nBlip\n.\nDual Barrel Wrist-mounted Machine Gun\n: The left gauntlet of Falcon's redesigned uniform utilizes a wrist-mounted dual emission machine gun controlled via clenching a fist. Falcon utilized this firearm against \nAnt-Man\n.\nWrist-mounted Miniature Rocket Launcher\n: Falcon utilized a wrist-mounted miniature rocket launcher on his right bracer against \nSpider-Man\n during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n.\n\"How does \nit\n feel?\"\n\"Like it's someone else's.\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Sam Wilson\n[src]\nCaptain America's Shield\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nWilson practices with throwing the \nshield\n \n \n After \nSteve Rogers\n returned to the past to live his life with \nPeggy Carter\n, he met with Wilson to give him his iconic shield. Although he initially felt unworthy of the shield and declined the mantle of Captain America, he changed his mind after he was forced to reclaim the shield from the unhinged \nJohn Walker\n. The \nvibranium\n composition allows the shield to absorb and reflect kinetic energy from impacts, therefore, making it nigh-indestructible. Nearly every kind of human weaponry cannot even dent it, as bullets normally bounce off it. The shield's shape makes it a superb throwing weapon as it can cut through the air with minimal wind resistance. It is also able to bounce off solid objects, such as walls and floors, when struck on its edge and can be ricocheted off of multiple surfaces, and makes a formidable and devastating hand-held weapon.\nGlock 19\n: Wilson disarmed an \nLAF\n member of their pistol.\nIWI Masada\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nWilson searching for Nagel\n \n \n Wilson carried a pistol when he was searching for \nWilfred Nagel\n.\nCZ P-10\n: Wilson used another pistol during the \nAmbush at Buccaneer Bay\n.\nM4A1 Carbine\n: An assault rifle that Wilson obtained from one of the \nHYDRA\n mercenaries accompanying the \nWinter Soldier\n. Wilson used it to cover for \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n after being ambushed by the mercenaries in \nWashington, D.C.\n He briefly held another M4A1 in \nMadripoor\n, commandeered from a security guard, but he discarded it before he could use it.\nKnife\n: Falcon utilized a knife to cut off the strap of a \nHYDRA\n operative's M4A1 Carbine during the fight against the HYDRA mercenaries.\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\n\"Those poor techs can't keep up with a billion returning IP addresses and your sick-ass \nStark\n-level tech.\"\n\nJoaqun Torres\n to Sam Wilson\n[src]\nEXO-7 Falcon\n: A jetpack with wings that enables the user to fly. The wings can also be used as defensive and offensive weapons, as they are highly flexible and bulletproof. Due to the wings' length, they can be used as mid-ranged weapons, mostly for stabbing. It also stores miniature guided missiles that seek out targets predetermined by \nRedwing\n.\n\"I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson. I didn't recognize you without the goggles.\"\nPolice Officer to \nSam Wilson\n[src]\nCombat Goggles\n: Falcon has a pair of protective goggles that not only protect his eyes during high-speed flight, but also possess telescopic and microscopic vision, allowing him to see and track even a shrunken \nAnt-Man\n.\n\"His name is \nRedwing\n.\"\nFalcon\n[src]\nRedwing\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nFalcon sending out \nRedwing\n onto a mission\n \n \n A drone mounted on the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n's back that assists Falcon during missions to survey an area for enemies, which allowed Falcon to confirm \nCrossbones\n' location before his attack. During combat missions, Redwing is fitted with twin guns that extend from both wings for offense, as well as a projectile grappling handcuff line on its underside, which Falcon used against \nSpider-Man\n to throw him out of a window. He used Redwing to surveil the \nFlag Smashers\n' \nhideout\n, but it was broken in the ensuing battle. However, \nWakanda\n made a new Redwing for Wilson, which he used to determine that \nAyla Perez\n could help him stop \nDiego\n.\nCaptain America Uniform\n: Wilson wore a Captain America uniform made by the \nWakandan Design Group\n. It was a \nvibranium\n version of the \nEXO-7 Falcon\n and had a primarily blue color scheme and no helmet. He wore the uniform as he fought the \nFlag Smashers\n and convinced the \nGlobal Repatriation Council\n to vote against the \nPatch Act\n.\nVehicles\n[\n]\n2014 Chevrolet Impala\n: Wilson owned a Chevrolet Impala, which he used as his personal car during his day-to-day life in \nWashington, D.C.\n. When he was transporting \nSteve Rogers\n, \nJasper Sitwell\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, the car was attacked by \nWinter Soldier\n, and ultimately flipped over, disabling the car.\nPaul & Darlene\n: During his youth in \nLouisiana\n, Wilson and his \nsister\n spent much of their time onboard their family's boat, supporting their \nWilson Family Seafood\n business, with Wilson being incredibly passionate about the boat and its personal history to him. Once Wilson returned home, he was informed by his sister that she would be forced to sell the boat, due to not being able to afford to keep it running, only for Wilson to insist that she allow him to try and raise the funds to keep the boat.\nQuinjet\n: During their time on the run from the law, Wilson would pilot \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n onboard their stolen Quinjet. Upon rescuing \nWanda Maximoff\n and \nVision\n from the clutches of the \nBlack Order\n, Wilson flew them back to the \nAvengers Compound\n to make their plan. Agreeing that they would seek help from \nWakanda\n, Wilson flew the Quinjet there, fearing that he would crash into the mountains, only for him to discover that this was Wakanda's disguise to protect them from discovery.\nJeep\n: Following their failed clash with the \nFlag Smashers\n, Wilson and \nBucky Barnes\n were offered a lift to the airport in a jeep by \nJohn Walker\n and \nLemar Hoskins\n. Although they eventually had agreed to the lift, albeit reluctantly, Wilson and Barnes eventually stormed out of the jeep and continued walking when Walker and Hoskins had offended them.\nHelmut Zemo's Private Jet\n: After getting broken out of prison by \nBucky Barnes\n, an old foe, \nHelmut Zemo\n, agreed to help Wilson and Barnes take down the \nFlag Smashers\n. They took Zemo's Private Jet to \nMadripoor\n and \nLatvia\n to look for leads.\n2023 GMC Sierra\n: \nTo be added.\nFacilities\n[\n]\nWilson Family Residence\n: Wilson grew up in the Wilson Family Residence, located in \nDelacroix\n, \nLouisiana\n with his family. He later stayed there with \nBucky Barnes\n after they defeated the \nFlag Smashers\n.\nSam Wilson's Apartment\n: While in the USAF, Wilson lived in an apartment in \nWashington, D.C.\n During his time here, Wilson agreed to protect \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, once they came to him after being targeted for assassination. Wilson gave Rogers and Romanoff shelter in his apartment, where they discussed their plan to go after \nJasper Sitwell\n, with Wilson agreeing to assist them in the mission. He later left this residence in \n2015\n, when he joined the \nAvengers\n and moved into the \nAvengers Compound\n. In \n2023\n, after returning from the \nBlip\n, he returned to live in the apartment, and made the decision to give up \nCaptain America\n's \nshield\n.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility\n: Having escaped being captured by \nHYDRA\n, Wilson was taken along with Rogers and Romanoff by \nMaria Hill\n to meet with \nNick Fury\n at the underground facility when he was in hiding from HYDRA. From here, Wilson discussed the plan to prevent HYDRA from enacting \nProject Insight\n. Having come up with a plan, Wilson spoke to Rogers on the top of the base about the likelihood that he would be able to save \nBucky Barnes\n from HYDRA's brainwashing.\nTriskelion\n: In order to stop Project Insight from being launched Wilson accompanied Rogers and Hill into the building, where they swiftly took over the control room and alerted the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agents of HYDRA's infiltration. Once Wilson's \nEXO-7 Falcon\n had been damaged during a brief clash with \nWinter Soldier\n, Wilson returned into the Triskelion and fought against \nBrock Rumlow\n, before narrowly escaping it after it was destroyed as a \nHelicarrier\n crashed into the side of the building.\nAvengers Tower\n: Wilson was invited to attend a party at Avengers Tower, which \nTony Stark\n was hosting to celebrate the defeat of \nBaron Strucker\n, and the recovery of the \nScepter\n. During the party, Wilson would play a game of pool with Rogers, before they discussed the search for Barnes, and the likelihood of Wilson ever joining the Avengers.\nAvengers Compound\n: Once Wilson became a member of the Avengers, he was given his own room in the facility. During this time, Falcon attempted to defend the facility when \nAnt-Man\n had attempted to gain access, only for Wilson to embarrassingly lose his fight against Ant-Man. However, a few months later, he and Rogers were forced to leave the facility in the wake of the \nSokovia Accords\n and went on the run for two years. In \n2018\n, Wilson returned to the facility briefly, having regrouped with \nWanda Maximoff\n and \nJames Rhodes\n, as he and his allies discussed a plan to deal with the impending threat of \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n. When he returned to life in the \nBlip\n, Wilson saw that the facility had been destroyed and witnessed the recovery crew of the facility.\nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre Building\n: Wilson was apprehended and brought to the \nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre\n's building along with \nSteve Rogers\n and \nBucky Barnes\n. However, Barnes eventually broke out of the facility, and Rogers and Wilson went to hide with him.\nBaltimore Police Station\n: Wilson went to the Baltimore Police Station after \nBucky Barnes\n had been arrested for not attending his court mandated therapy. There he met Barnes' therapist \nChristina Raynor\n who told him to attend Barnes' therapy session in one of the station's rooms.\nHelmut Zemo's Latvian Residence\n: Wilson, \nBucky Barnes\n, and \nHelmut Zemo\n went to \nLatvia\n and stayed in Zemo's residence there while looking for the \nFlag Smashers\n. They used it as a base of operations and discuss plans in the building. They returned to the residence after they failed to stop the terrorist group, and were confronted by \nJohn Walker\n and \nLemar Hoskins\n, who attempted to bring Zemo into custody. This turned into a battle against the \nDora Milaje\n, which Wilson and Barnes helped with, until Zemo escaped the residence.\nPrisons\n[\n]\n\"You don't know what it's like to be locked up in cell. Oh, that's right, you do.\"\n\nHelmut Zemo\n to Sam Wilson\n[src]\nRaft\n: Wilson was imprisoned on the Raft along with \nClint Barton\n, \nScott Lang\n, and \nWanda Maximoff\n on the orders of \nThaddeus Ross\n due to violating the \nSokovia Accords\n after getting caught at \nLeipzig-Halle Airport\n.

After he suffered a plane crash, he was genetically altered with the ability to speak telepathically with birds. Wilson would also eventually take over the mantle of Captain America.\nFalcon's first suit in \nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n is more similar to the suit of his \nUltimate comics variant\n than that of his \nMainstream Universe version\n. His second suit was given some red and white coloring as a nod to the costume from the mainstream universe. Falcon's history in the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n is inspired from and similar to that of his Ultimate counterpart too. Falcon's suit in \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n holds the closest resemblance yet to his mainstream comic book counterpart.\nBehind the Scenes\n[\n]\nAnthony Mackie\n was extremely disappointed to discover that the suit he would be wearing in \nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n would not resemble the red spandex suit from the mainstream comics.\nAaron Toney\n and \nDavid Charles Warren\n were stunt doubles for \nAnthony Mackie\n in the role of Falcon.\nDelpaneaux Wills\n, \nQualen Bradley\n, \nSimon Adegbenro\n and \nJordane Christie\n were stand-ins for \nAnthony Mackie\n in the role of Falcon.\nFalcon was briefly considered to appear in \nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n as the new Captain America to aid \nSpider-Man\n on his adventure, but as the movie's arc centers on a new generation of heroes, it was decided to drop Falcon's appearance for \"\nNick Fury\n\" to not have any of the \nAvengers\n available sans Spider-Man.\n[\n32\n]\nReferences\n[\n]\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of images and media related to \nCaptain America\n.\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of quotes related to \nCaptain America\n.\n\n \nSamuel Thomas Wilson's Skills\n \n2.00\n \n2.01\n \n2.02\n \n2.03\n \n2.04\n \n2.05\n \n2.06\n \n2.07\n \n2.08\n \n2.09\n \n2.10\n \n2.11\n \n2.12\n \nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n \n3.0\n \n3.1\n \n3.2\n \n3.3\n \n3.4\n \n3.5\n \n3.6\n \n3.7\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.06: One World, One People\n \n4.0\n \n4.1\n \n4.2\n \n4.3\n \n4.4\n \n4.5\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.02: The Star-Spangled Man\n \n5.00\n \n5.01\n \n5.02\n \n5.03\n \n5.04\n \n5.05\n \n5.06\n \n5.07\n \n5.08\n \n5.09\n \n5.10\n \n5.11\n \n5.12\n \n5.13\n \n5.14\n \n5.15\n \n5.16\n \n5.17\n \nCaptain America: Brave New World\n \n6.0\n \n6.1\n \n6.2\n \n6.3\n \n6.4\n \n6.5\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.03: Power Broker\n \n7.0\n \n7.1\n \nMarvel Studios Secret Archives | \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n | Available on Disney+\n (translated from Spanish)\n\n \n4/30/2018 on Scott's laptop in \nAnt-Man and the Wasp\n\n \nMarvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline\n \n10.0\n \n10.1\n \n10.2\n \n10.3\n \n10.4\n \n10.5\n \nAvengers: Infinity War\n \n11.0\n \n11.1\n \nChris Evans Returning To Marvel For Avengers: Doomsday\n\n \nThe Making of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n on Twitter - April 22, 2021\n \n14.0\n \n14.1\n \n14.2\n \n14.3\n \n14.4\n \n14.5\n \n14.6\n \n14.7\n \n14.8\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.05: Truth\n \n15.0\n \n15.1\n \n15.2\n \n15.3\n \n15.4\n \n15.5\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.04: The Whole World Is Watching\n \n16.0\n \n16.1\n \n16.2\n \n16.3\n \n16.4\n \n16.5\n \nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.01: New World Order\n \n17.0\n \n17.1\n \n17.2\n \nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\n \nCaptain America: Road to War\n \n19.0\n \n19.1\n \n19.2\n \nAnt-Man\n\n \nPeyton Reed on Twitter - May 2, 2020\n \n21.00\n \n21.01\n \n21.02\n \n21.03\n \n21.04\n \n21.05\n \n21.06\n \n21.07\n \n21.08\n \n21.09\n \n21.10\n \n21.11\n \nCaptain America: Civil War\n \n22.0\n \n22.1\n \nCaptain America: Civil War\n \nDeleted Scene\n \n23.0\n \n23.1\n \n23.2\n \nAvengers: Infinity War Prelude, Issue 1\n\n \nAvengers: Infinity War: The Heroes' Journey\n\n \nCaptain Marvel Prelude\n \n26.0\n \n26.1\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n\n \nAvengers: Endgame\n \nDeleted Scene\n \n28.0\n \n28.1\n \nLook Out for the Little Guy!\n\n \nAs revealed in the \nMarvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline\n book\n\n \nCaptain America: Brave New World: A Hero Looks Like You\n\n \nThunderbolts*\n\n \nSpider-Man: Far From Home Almost Included First Look At Falcon As Captain America\nExternal Links\n[\n]\n \nCaptain America\n on \nMarvel Database\n \nFalcon\n on \nMarvel Database\n \nSam Wilson\n on \nMarvel Database\n \nFalcon\n on \nWikipedia\n \nSam Wilson\n on \nWikipedia\n \nCaptain America\n on \nMarvel.com\n \nAvengers\nCaptain America\n  \nIron Man\n  \nBlack Widow\n  \nHulk\n  \nThor\n  \nHawkeye\n  \nQuicksilver\n  \nWanda Maximoff\n  \nVision\n  \nWar Machine\n  \nFalcon\n  \nSpider-Man\n  \nCaptain Marvel\n  \nNebula\n  \nRocket\n  \nOkoye\n  \nAnt-Man\n"
