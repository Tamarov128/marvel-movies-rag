Torres, Wilson and Bat-Seraph quickly ran to their car and drove away, managing to escape. The three headed to Norfolk, where they grouped up with Dennis Dunphy and his team. Torres used a terminal and plugged in the data he obtained from Camp Echo One to create a program that would block out Leader's mind control.

Falcon kept the Japanese pilots distracted, but when Jackal fired his last two missiles, Falcon destroyed one of them. Falcon went to get the other one, but Captain America warned him to not. Falcon did not listen and destroyed the missile, but was hit in the blast, causing him to fall out of the sky and into the water, where he was recovered by search and rescue.[1] Hospitalized[] \"You never messed up like I have.
