Kuala Lumpur Research Facility Feeling lost and depressed without her sister, Yelena Belova continues her work as O.X.E. chairwoman Valentina Allegra de Fontaine's personal enforcer. She successfully infiltrates an O.X.E. research facility in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and eliminates all traces connecting de Fontaine to the company's illicit \"Sentry\" project, requesting her next assignment. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress and newly-appointed Congressman Bucky Barnes move to impeach de Fontaine from her position in the CIA. She denies any involvement in O.X.E.'s efforts at artificially creating superhumans and insists her only goal is to safeguard a world bereft of the Avengers, while ordering her subordinates to remove any remaining evidence. Alexei Shostakov is met by Yelena Belova In Washington, D.C., Belova visits Alexei Shostakov, now running a limo business and he lost weight from prison although he would rather work for de Fontaine like her. Contemplating if she should stop working for de Fontaine, Belova asks Shostakov wherein the point lies. Answering to Belova's query whether he feels fulfilled, Shostakov admits his happiest days were serving as the Red Guardian and advises Belova to follow in Natasha's footsteps. Before leaving, Belova gazes at an old photo of herself smiling with her West Chesapeake Valley Thunderbolts soccer team. She requests a more public assignment from de Fontaine before accepting her next operation. Ghost, U.S. Agent, Taskmaster and Yelena Belova fight Belova breaches the O.X.E. Vault in Utah to stop a rogue operative, revealed to be Ghost, from stealing valuable assets. She is ambushed by U.S. Agent, whose mission is to kill Belova. Taskmaster soon intervenes, having been assigned to take out U.S. Agent. After Ghost kills Taskmaster, a disoriented and amnesiac man named Bob Reynolds fails to escape through sealed doors. Simultaneously, de Fontaine hosts an event in honor of the first responders from the Battle of New York while Barnes tries to establish a contact with her assistant Mel Gold, hoping for her collaboration in de Fontaine's impeachment. Yelena Belova, U.S. Agent, Ghost, and Bob Reynolds avoid incineration Realizing de Fontaine intended to trap them inside the vault and erase all evidence, the operatives narrowly escape her incinerators. After touching Bob' hand during her fall, Belova experiences a vision of her assassination of Anya for the Red Room. In his limo, Shostakov hears of de Fontaine's plans to travel to the vault with a strike team to finish Belova and others off. Growing suspicious of Bob, U.S. Agent confronts him about how he got inside, prompting Belova to diffuse the tension. Bob, struggling with feelings of unworthiness, urges Belova to leave him behind. She confides that she suppresses her own darkness in what he calls a \"void.\" As de Fontaine and Gold identify Bob as Robert Reynolds, Project Sentry's only surviving test subject, the group reaches the surface. Ghost, Bob Reynolds, Yelena Belova, and U.S. Agent encounter O.X.E.'s strike team With the strike team outside the vault, Belova's plan unravels. During the ensuing clash with O.X.E., she, U.S. Agent, and Reynolds don disguises and escape in a vehicle obtained by Ghost. When questioned by a soldier, Reynolds leaps from the vehicle with a rifle, causing a diversion. The O.X.E. soldiers open fire at him. De Fontaine fails to stop them in time, but Reynolds survives and soars into the air before slamming into the ground upon passing out, sending the vehicle hurtling off a cliff. The group survives and Belova shares the Project Sentry documents she found within the vault with U.S. Agent and Ghost. Bucky Barnes captures the Thunderbolts As the group plans to lay low and hide from de Fontaine, they get picked up by Red Guardian's limo, as he rushed there to save Belova. The \"Thunderbolts,\" as U.S. Agent sarcastically called themselves after Belova shared parts of her past with the rest, were pursued by O.X.E. vehicles. Winter Soldier, having tracked Gold's phone after their call, disables the convoy and detains the Thunderbolts to have them testify against de Fontaine. Meanwhile, O.X.E. takes Reynolds to the Watchtower, formerly Avengers Tower, where de Fontaine where she interrogates him. Upon touching his hand, she envisions her father's death. Rattled, she exits and instructs Gold to develop a kill switch and stage a media rollout for Reynolds. Gold voices concern over Reynolds' instability, but de Fontaine sees potential. Winter Soldier, learning from Gold and the Thunderbolts the threat Reynolds poses, recruits them to stop her and save him. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine addresses the Thunderbolts De Fontaine manipulates Reynolds into becoming the superhero Sentry. The Thunderbolts arrive in New York City and assault the Watchtower, confronting de Fontaine inside. She unveils Sentry to them as \"Earth's mightiest hero,\" planning for him to neutralize the group publicly, painting them as criminals so it would clear her name. The group's attacks are impervious to Sentry, causing the Thunderbolts to retreat. Despite de Fontaine's orders to kill them, Sentry starts to believe in his own superiority and opposes her. Sentry attacks her, but drops to the floor lifeless once Gold presses kill switch. Sentry reawakens as his darker half, Void. Yelena Belova chooses to face Void The Thunderbolts break up and depart after a distressed Belova notes her and the team's incompetence. Followed by Red Guardian, Belova vents to him about her regrets and deteriorating mental health. He reminds her of her role on the soccer team: to give others someone to rely on when they make mistakes. Belova finds comfort in his words, and the two are interrupted by the arrival of the Void, who begins to engulf the whole city in shadows. The other Thunderbolts return to rescue civilians from the ensuing carnage, though Belova decides to willingly step into the void. Bob Reynolds and his friends confront Void Inside, Belova confronts her haunting childhood and struggles with alcoholism. The team hesitates to follow until U.S. Agent recalls experiencing a similar illusion in the vault. Within a mental projection of Reynolds' childhood bedroom, Void's \"nicest room,\" Belova speaks with him about his childhood abuse. She encourages him to confront his pain, as she has, before the Thunderbolts arrive to help them stop Void. To escape, Reynolds brings them to the \"worst room,\" a manifestation of the research facility, where Void taunts Reynolds by calling him worthless. Reynolds violently battles his darker self and allows it to consume him, but the Thunderbolts manage to reach him and reassure Reynolds of his worth. The Thunderbolts approach Valentina Allegra de Fontaine Reynolds reverses Void's effects on New York upon regaining control, although he does not retain any memories of it happening. The Thunderbolts then approach de Fontaine to take her down once and for all, but suddenly find themselves at a press conference that de Fontaine organized in haste. Scrambling to save herself, she claims that the Thunderbolts were her \"secret project\" at retaining protection for the United States, publically revealing them as the \"New Avengers.\" Belova reminds her that she lies under their control. While Reynolds is benched as to not unleash Void again, the New Avengers go on to be featured on Wheaties cereal boxes, which Shostakov eagerly attempts to market. Fourteen months later, amid an ongoing space crisis, the New Avengers debate Sam Wilson's lawsuit against them over their use of the \"Avengers\" trademark. Shostakov proposes changing their name to the \"New Avengerz.\" The team then receives an alert from space about an incoming extra-dimensional spacecraft bearing a \"4\" insignia.
