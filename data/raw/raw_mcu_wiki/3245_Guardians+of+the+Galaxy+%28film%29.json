To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits--\nRocket\n, a gun-toting raccoon; \nGroot\n, a tree-like humanoid; the deadly and enigmatic \nGamora\n; and the revenge-driven \nDrax the Destroyer\n. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand--with the galaxy's fate in the balance.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \nMissouri\n, \n1988\n, a young boy named \nPeter Quill\n stands by his mother, \nMeredith\n, as she lays dying in a hospital bed. Close to death and delirious, Meredith laments on Peter's \nfather\n, whom the boy has never met, describing him as an \"angel\". When Meredith finally passes on, a distraught Peter flees from the hospital. After distancing himself from the building, he enters a field where a \nspaceship\n suddenly appears, the occupants of which bring Peter aboard and depart into space.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwenty-six years later\n, Quill is now an adult and a member of the \nRavagers\n led by \nYondu\n. The Ravagers are hired by the \nBroker\n to recover an \nOrb\n from the planet \nMorag\n. Quill, who has grown bitter towards the Ravagers for abducting him and ruining his childhood, travels to Morag alone and steals the Orb for himself, only to be intercepted by \nKorath the Pursuer\n who served under \nRonan the Accuser\n. For the past several years, Ronan, despite a delicate peace treaty between his \npeople\n and the \nXandarians\n, has been systematically invading Xandarian controlled and allied worlds, killing hundreds of thousands in a mad quest for Kree purity. The Xandarians have tried to plead their case to the Kree hierarchy, but the Kree refuse to get involved.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Quill escapes with the artifact, Yondu discovers he has stolen the Ravager's prize and issues a bounty for his capture. Meanwhile, Ronan is revealed to be searching for the Orb as part of a deal with \nThanos\n in exchange for the annihilation of \nXandar\n. To aid in the hunt, Thanos has lent Ronan \nGamora\n and \nNebula\n. By tracking the Ravagers' brokers and past dealings, the villains learn of Yondu's deal with the Broker and send Gamora to Xandar to intercept Quill.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn Xandar, Quill attempts to sell the Orb to the Broker, but upon learning that Korath was working for Ronan, the Broker refuses to become involved with the Orb and turns Quill away. Suddenly, Quill is ambushed by Gamora, who takes the Orb and flees into the streets. A fight ensues, drawing in two bounty hunters, \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n, who both seek to collect Udonta's bounty. The \nNova Corps\n, Xandar's prime military force, arrive and arrest the group, imprisoning them in the \nKyln\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the Kyln, the other prisoners, aware of Gamora's relationship with Thanos and Ronan, threaten her life. \nDrax the Destroyer\n even attempts to kill Gamora for the murder of his \nwife\n and \ndaughter\n by Ronan, but Quill convinces him that he can get to Ronan through Gamora. Gamora reveals that she intended to betray Ronan and keep the Orb, having grown weary of Ronan's methodology, deeming him insane and a risk to galactic stability. Learning that Gamora has a buyer who is willing to pay a very hefty fee for the artifact, Rocket, Quill, Groot, and Gamora work together to escape the Kyln.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLearning of Gamora's betrayal, a furious Ronan meets with Thanos in person and angrily berates him for not taking Gamora's betrayal seriously. When \nOther\n scolds Ronan for disrespecting the warlord, Ronan angrily breaks the Other's neck, killing him and forcing Thanos to speak to Ronan directly. Undaunted by Ronan's complaints, Thanos waves Ronan away, and while Gamora's betrayal is an issue, Thanos entrusts both Ronan and Nebula with fixing that problem. As Ronan departs, Thanos grimly warns him that if he returns empty-handed again, he will \"bathe the stairways\" in his blood.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuill and his allies, accompanied by Drax, manage to escape the Kyln, where they distract the guards by disabling the station's artificial gravity. They flee in the \nMilano\n and travel to \nKnowhere\n where the fugitives spend time in the \nBoot of Jemiah\n, while Gamora was waiting for her contact. Drax and Rocket, both heavily intoxicated, get into a fight after Drax insults Rocket's appearance, after which a morose Rocket laments on his creation and the pain he was forced to endure.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Drax furiously leaves the proceedings, the rest of the group are summoned by \nCarina\n to meet with \nTaneleer Tivan\n. Arriving at Tivan's \nmuseum\n, the group hand the Orb over to Tivan, who opens up the artifact to reveal an \nInfinity Stone\n, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan explains that the stones were the remnants of six singularities that predate the universe, their power compacted into six \"stones\", and that their power was too great for all but the most powerful beings to wield; all others are inevitably destroyed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTivan prepares to give the outlaws their payment, but Carina, seeing this as a chance to free herself from servitude under Tivan, suddenly grabs the stone and taps into its power. A massive energy pulse is fired from the Orb, killing Carina and blowing up much of Tivan's collection. Quill, Gamora, Rocket, and Groot barely escape with their lives.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGamora, finally understanding the full extent of the danger the Orb holds, attempts to convince the others to hand it over to the Nova Corps for protection, when Ronan and his forces suddenly arrive, having been summoned by a drunken Drax. While Drax battles Ronan, the others attempt to escape using the \nMining Pods\n and are pursued by Ronan's \nSakaaran\n minions, led by Nebula. Ronan easily defeats Drax, while Nebula destroys Gamora's Pod, leaving her floating in space.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNebula takes the Orb and Ronan's forces depart. Despite Rocket's insistence that they flee, Quill finds himself unwilling to leave Gamora and summons Udonta before following her into space, giving her his \nhelmet\n to survive; Yondu arrives and collects the pair before they succumb to the exposure. Quill manages to negotiate a truce with the Ravagers after convincing Yondu that they can recover the Orb from Ronan and sell it.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGroot convinces Rocket and Drax to rescue Quill and Gamora, and the three attempt an attack on Udonta's ship to recover their friends. Reunited, the group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they must stop him from using the Infinity Stone to lay waste to the galaxy. On the \nDark Aster\n, Ronan contacts Thanos, who demands that the Kree deliver the Orb to him as promised. However, Ronan embeds the \nPower Stone\n in his \nhammer\n, taking its power for himself, promising that after the destruction of Xandar, he will come for Thanos. Hateful of her adopted father for all the suffering he wrought upon her throughout her life, Nebula agrees to aid Ronan. Quill sends a message to \nRhomann Dey\n, warning the Nova Corps of Ronan's attack.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAllying with a Nova Corps fleet, Quill's group and the Ravagers arrive at Xandar, confronting the \nDark Aster\n. While Rocket assists the Nova Corps fleet, the rest of Quill's team breach the \nDark Aster\n and move towards Ronan. Gamora battles Nebula while Quill, Drax, and Groot battle and kill Korath and the Sakaaran soldiers. Defeating Nebula, Gamora tries to convince her sister to abandon Ronan and join her in freedom; deeming Gamora's new choice as insane, Nebula refuses her sister's offer and flees from the battle in a hijacked Ravager ship. As the battle proceeds, allies begin to fall as \nNecrocrafts\n start falling from the sky onto the city, killing many in the process including \nHoruz\n, while Rocket and other Ravagers were attempting to destroy the ships before they hit the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRonan uses his new power to destroy the Nova Corps fleet, including \nGarthan Saal\n and easily overmatches Quill's team. Before he can kill them, Rocket flies his ship into the \nDark Aster\n and into Ronan, seemingly killing him. The extensive damage causes the \nDark Aster\n to crash land on Xandar, with Groot apparently fatally sacrificing himself to shield the group.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuill's team survives the crash, but their relief is short-lived when Ronan, unscathed by the crash, emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar. Quill suddenly starts dancing, distracting Ronan long enough for Drax to destroy the Kree's hammer with the \nHadron Enforcer\n. The Infinity Stone flies from the hammer, and Quill grabs it, but its power begins to destroy him until he joins hands with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket, who share its burden. The four then direct the stone's power towards Ronan, utterly destroying him.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGamora immediately places the stone in a new orb, and Quill gives it to Yondu as part of their deal, although Quill warns that he should not open it since Yondu had seen what it was capable of doing. Yondu and the Ravagers then leave Xandar, commenting that they made a wise choice in not delivering Quill to \nhis father\n like they had been hired to do all those years ago. Once they have left, Quill reveals that he had switched the containers- Yondu later opens the orb to find one of Quill's \ntroll dolls\n. In the aftermath, Quill's group, now calling themselves the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n after a mockery by Ronan, are praised by the Nova-Prime, \nIrani Rael\n, who expunges their criminal histories.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe also reveals to Quill that, based on medical reports, they have deciphered that he is only half-human and that his father belongs to an ancient \nalien race\n that they have not yet encountered. The Guardians then leave Xandar in the \nMilano\n, which was repaired by the Nova Corps, and venture out into the galaxy in search of adventure, accompanied by a \nrecovered twig\n from Groot, which is already beginning to regrow.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile\n, Tivan sits in his destroyed archive, where he is licked by \nCosmo\n, and mocked by one of his collections: \nHoward the Duck\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nChris Pratt\n as \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nWyatt Oleff\n as Young \nPeter Quill\nZoe Saldana\n as \nGamora\nDave Bautista\n as \nDrax the Destroyer\nVin Diesel\n as \nGroot\n / \nBaby Groot\nKrystian Godlewski\n as \nGroot\n \n(on set)\nBradley Cooper\n as \nRocket\n \n(voice)\nLee Pace\n as \nRonan the Accuser\nMichael Rooker\n as \nYondu\nKaren Gillan\n as \nNebula\nDjimon Hounsou\n as \nKorath the Pursuer\nJohn C.
