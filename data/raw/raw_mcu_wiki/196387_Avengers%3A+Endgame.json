Suddenly, everyone except Clint vanishes into dust. \nTwenty-three days later, \nTony Stark\n and \nNebula\n are adrift in space on the \nBenatar\n, their fuel and supplies dwindling. As Stark, still injured from his fight with Thanos and close to starving to death, records a message for his fiance \nPepper Potts\n in preparation for his demise, \nCarol Danvers\n locates the spaceship and brings them back to \nEarth\n. Stark reunites with Potts, \nSteve Rogers\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n, \nBruce Banner\n and \nJames Rhodes\n; \nRocket\n joins Nebula as they mourn the fall of their fellow \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has been three weeks since \nThanos\n decimated half the universe's population with a \nsnap\n of his fingers. Stark furiously confronts Rogers accusing him of being the one who broke apart the \nAvengers\n and as a result they were unable to stand united during their \nconflict\n with the Mad Titan. He questions why the Avengers only do their best \nafter\n the worst has already come to pass before passing out due to exhaustion. With a tip from Nebula about her father's location, along with a Snap-like energy signature from two days prior, the team head into space for the \nGarden\n, intending to take the \nInfinity Stones\n back and reverse the destruction. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThey discover Thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended cooking a meal when they launch an \nambush\n quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n only to find it emptied of its Stones. Thanos revealed that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. Although suspected of lying by Rhodes, Nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. Surprised with the affirmation, Thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment on his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by \nThor\n. Although the Mad Titan is dead, they failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFive years later\n, the surviving population has yet to cope with their losses. Rogers now runs a \nsupport group\n for people to try and help them come to terms with what happened. Stark and Potts are now married and are living in a \nremote cabin\n with their daughter \nMorgan\n. In \nSan Francisco\n, \nScott Lang\n escapes from the \nQuantum Realm\n when a rat activates controls left behind by \nthe\n \nvan Dyne\n \nfamily\n before they vanished. Lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. He approaches the \nWall of the Vanished\n, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who was killed in the Snap. He frantically searches it hoping to not find \nCassie\n's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). Scott rushes to Cassie's house and finds that she is now a teenager. Father and daughter tearfully reunite.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the \nAvengers Compound\n, Romanoff now commands the team as they perform various assignments. Rhodes informs her of a recent cartel massacre carried out by Barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. Lang arrives at the compound and reveals to Romanoff and Rogers that although five years had passed, he spent five hours in the realm. He proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the Stones from different times. But since the three have no knowledge with the handling with quantum physics, they seek out Stark. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting  Morgan in danger of being erased from existence, Stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and \nPeter Parker\n. He successfully develops a \nTime-Space GPS\n based on an inverted Mbius strip. Stark consults with Potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. Meanwhile, the other Avengers recruit Banner, who merged his intellect with Hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on Lang using his \nvan\n. The experiment does not turn out as expected, as Lang constantly shifts between different ages. Afterwards, Stark arrives at the facility with the GPS and returns Rogers' \nshield\n to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what Thanos did. Rogers agrees.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe remaining Avengers begin to regroup. As Nebula returns to New York, Banner and Rocket travel to \nNew Asgard\n and recruit Thor, who has become an overweight drunkard traumatized with his perceived failure to stop Thanos. Romanoff goes to \nTokyo\n and finds Barton, who massacred a group of Yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the Snap. Rocket and Stark build a time machine, while Barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. Grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Avengers plan out their \nTime Heist\n, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the Infinity Stones: the \nSpace\n, \nMind\n, and \nTime Stones\n are found in \n2012\n New York, the \nReality Stone\n in \n2013\n \nAsgard\n, and the \nPower\n and \nSoul Stones\n on \nMorag\n and \nVormir\n respectively in \n2014\n. They split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of \nPym Particles\n since \nHank Pym\n also perished in the Snap.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRogers, Stark, Banner, and Lang arrive in an \nalternate 2012\n in the midst of the \nBattle of New York\n. Banner approaches the \nNew York Sanctum\n and finds the \nAncient One\n, who refuses to lend the Time Stone to him. However, she relents after learning that \nDoctor Strange\n had given it away to Thanos in the future, fearing that it was done for a reason. At \nStark Tower\n, Lang and Stark attempt to steal the \nTesseract\n, but loses it to \nLoki\n, who uses it to teleport away. Rogers obtains the \nScepter\n from \nSTRIKE\n possession by feigning \nHYDRA\n affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 \nself\n who confuses him for Loki. After defeating his past self, Rogers rendezvous with Stark and Lang.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith only enough \nPym Particles\n for one more trip each, Stark and Rogers decide to go back further to \nCamp Lehigh\n to an \nalternate 1970\n, where they have another shot to grab the Tesseract and more Pym Particles. Lang is left with the Scepter to return to the present day. At the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n base, Rogers stealthily obtains the Particles from \nHank Pym\n, but runs into \nPeggy Carter\n's office while evading security. He tearfully observes as she works in her office. Meanwhile, Stark encounters his father \nHoward\n after obtaining the Tesseract. With the latter's wife \nMaria\n expecting a baby, Tony (under the guise of \"Howard Potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father is what all that mattered. Before they part ways, Tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nArriving on Asgard in an \nalternate 2013\n, Thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother \nFrigga\n, recalling this is the day of her demise. Rocket attempts to encourage him to settle his grief and help him extract the Aether from \nJane Foster\n's body, but Thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. Thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from Frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate \nson\n is from the future. Sharing a talk, Frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. Thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. As Rocket returns with the Aether in hand, Thor shares one last hug with Frigga before reaching out to retrieve \nMjlnir\n, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn an \nalternate 2014\n, Barton and Romanoff board the \nBenatar\n for Vormir, while Nebula and Rhodes remain on Morag and wait for \nPeter Quill\n to arrive and lead them to the \nOrb\n's chamber. They knock Quill out and collect the Stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, Nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. The \nThanos\n of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. Determined to know more, Thanos captures Nebula as she attempts to warn Barton and Romanoff of his newfound involvement. \nPast Nebula\n confronts her future self and collects her GPS and Pym Particles, handing it over to her father.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, Barton and Romanoff arrive on Vormir. They meet \nRed Skull\n, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. Barton laughs at the concept, but Romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as Thanos had murdered his daughter \nGamora\n there in their time. Understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while Barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, Romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. As they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. Ultimately, Romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the Soul Stone with Barton.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Avengers return to the present day. Stricken with the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. They construct a \nnew gauntlet\n and load the six Stones onto it. Thor attempts to volunteer to perform the snap, but Banner steps in due to the Stones' gamma radiation. While severely scarring his arm, he successfully \nsnaps\n his fingers and brings the victims of the Snap back to life. Elsewhere, Past Nebula  who traveled to the present in place of her future self  opens a time portal, allowing Thanos to bring \nSanctuary II\n forward from 2014. The Avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, leveling the facility to a pile of rubble.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs Thanos sends Past Nebula to retrieve the Stones, her future self reveals to Gamora their improved relationship in the future. Gamora decides to join Nebula to stop her father. Meanwhile, Rhodes, Rocket and Banner are trapped in a flooding area, forcing Lang to come and save them. Barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewers, which is infested with \nOutriders\n. After escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to Past Nebula, who is then confronted by Gamora and Nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. Stark, Rogers and Thor confront Thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the Stones. After Stark and Thor are overpowered and knocked aside in the ensuing fight, Rogers wields Mjlnir against the time-displaced Titan. However, Thanos severely injures him and nearly destroys his shield with his \nsword\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThanos summons the rest of his army, which include the \nChitauri\n and the \nBlack Order\n, to lay siege on Earth. Just as Rogers prepares to face them alone, a series of portals appear behind him. The \nMasters of the Mystic Arts\n have arrived with reinforcements from \nKamar-Taj\n, \nWakanda\n, \nContraxia\n and New Asgard, along with the Avengers' resurrected allies from Wakanda, \nTitan\n and San Francisco. Lang, growing to giant size, retrieves Banner, Rhodes and Rocket from the flooded depths. With the scales now balanced, Rogers calls for the Avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the \nbattle\n for the fate of the universe.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBanner tells Barton that they must get the Stones back to their respective times and away from Thanos. With their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; Ant-Man and \nWasp\n jump to hotwire the dead vehicle. As Thanos' forces close in on Barton. he passes the gauntlet onto \nBlack Panther\n. As Thanos prepares to charge at T'Challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful \nWanda Maximoff\n, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of \nVision\n. As Wanda engages Thanos, T'Challa runs, only to become entrapped by \nEbony Maw\n. Seeing T'Challa's predicament, \nSpider-Man\n swoops in and snatches the gauntlet. \nMeanwhile, Maximoff's attacks leave Thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air, the whole time ripping chunks of armor from his body. In order to escape her grasp, Thanos orders another missile barrage from \nSanctuary II\n (against \nCorvus Glaive\n's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. One of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing \nDoctor Strange\n out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuddenly, \nSanctuary II\n redirects its fire to an object arriving from outer space. It was Carol Danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. Retrieving the gauntlet from Parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. However, Thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. With the gauntlet in Thanos' reach, Stark, Rogers, Thor and Danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. However, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. Strange informs Stark that \nthis\n is the one future that ends in their victory. Determined, Stark dashes at Thanos one last time, but he is knocked aside as the Titan snaps his fingers. Nothing happens, as the Stones have been stolen by Stark and transferred onto his suit. With the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy, Stark snaps his own fingers.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThanos watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after. Stark is mortally wounded from his usage of the Stones, and is greeted by Rhodes, Parker and Potts as he lays dying. Potts assures her husband that they are going to be alright, and allows him to rest. Stark's \nArc Reactor\n then permanently shuts off, Potts giving him one last kiss. Rogers and Thor mournfully watch at a distance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Mad Titan's final defeat and the return of the Vanished calls for celebrations all around the world, including in Wakanda and San Francisco. At Stark's funeral, he leaves a final holographic message for his family and closest friends, including a heartfelt goodbye for Morgan. Stark's original Arc Reactor is set adrift in the lake outside their cabin, with the Avengers and their allies in attendance, including those who had past grievances with Stark, such as the Pym family, Wanda, and \nBucky Barnes\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutside New Asgard, Thor names \nValkyrie\n as Asgard's new ruler while he abdicates to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, following his mother's advice. Meanwhile, Rogers prepares to go back in time to return the Stones and Mjlnir, bidding goodbye to Barnes. As Banner is unable to bring him back when prompted, Barnes alerts \nSam Wilson\n to the presence of an elderly man nearby. It is an aged up Rogers, who had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full life with \nPeggy Carter\n. He presents Wilson with a new shield, passing the mantle of Captain America on to him.\nCast\n[\n]\nRobert Downey Jr.\n as \nTony Stark/Iron Man\n / \nTony Stark/Iron Man\nChris Evans\n as \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n / \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n / \nLoki\n \n(illusion)\nPatrick Gorman\n as Old \nSteve Rogers\nMark Ruffalo\n as \nBruce Banner/Hulk\n / \nBruce Banner/Hulk\nChris Hemsworth\n as \nThor\n / \nThor\nScarlett Johansson\n as \nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\n / \nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\nJeremy Renner\n as \nClint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin\n / \nClint Barton/Hawkeye\nDon Cheadle\n as \nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nPaul Rudd\n as \nScott Lang/Ant-Man\nBazlo\n and \nLoen LeClair\n as Baby \nScott Lang\nJackson Dunn\n as 12-year-old \nScott Lang\nLee Moore\n as 93-year-old \nScott Lang\nBenedict Cumberbatch\n as \nStephen Strange/Doctor Strange\nChadwick Boseman\n as \nT'Challa/Black Panther\nBrie Larson\n as \nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\nTom Holland\n as \nPeter Parker/Spider-Man\nKaren Gillan\n as \nNebula\n / \nNebula\nZoe Saldana\n as \nGamora\nEvangeline Lilly\n as \nHope van Dyne/Wasp\nTessa Thompson\n as \nBrunnhilde/Valkyrie\nRene Russo\n as Queen \nFrigga\nElizabeth Olsen\n as \nWanda Maximoff\nAnthony Mackie\n as \nSam Wilson/Falcon\nSebastian Stan\n as \nBucky Barnes/Winter Soldier\nTom Hiddleston\n as \nLoki\n / \nLoki\nDanai Gurira\n as \nOkoye\nBenedict Wong\n as Master \nWong\nPom Klementieff\n as \nMantis\nDave Bautista\n as \nDrax the Destroyer\nLetitia Wright\n as Princess \nShuri\nJohn Slattery\n as \nHoward Stark\nTilda Swinton\n as \nAncient One\nJon Favreau\n as \nHappy Hogan\nHayley Atwell\n as Director \nPeggy Carter\n / \nPeggy Carter\nNatalie Portman\n as Doctor \nJane Foster\nMarisa Tomei\n as \nMay Parker\nTaika Waititi\n as \nKorg\nAngela Bassett\n as Queen Mother \nRamonda\nMichael Douglas\n as Doctor \nHank Pym\n / Doctor \nHank Pym\nJohn Michael Morris\n as Young \nHank Pym\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n as \nJanet van Dyne\nWilliam Hurt\n as Secretary \nThaddeus Ross\nCobie Smulders\n as \nMaria Hill\nSean Gunn\n as \nKraglin Obfonteri\n / \nRocket\n \n(motion-capture)\nWinston Duke\n as \nM'Baku\nLinda Cardellini\n as \nLaura Barton\nMaximiliano Hernndez\n as Agent \nJasper Sitwell\nFrank Grillo\n as Agent \nBrock Rumlow\nHiroyuki Sanada\n as \nAkihiko\nTom Vaughan-Lawlor\n as \nEbony Maw\nJames D'Arcy\n as \nEdwin Jarvis\nJacob Batalon\n as \nNed Leeds\nVin Diesel\n as \nGroot\n \n(voice)\nBradley Cooper\n as \nRocket\n \n(voice)\nGwyneth Paltrow\n as \nPepper Potts/Rescue\nRobert Redford\n as Undersecretary \nAlexander Pierce\nJosh Brolin\n as \nThanos\n / \nThanos\nChris Pratt\n as \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\n / \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nSamuel L.
