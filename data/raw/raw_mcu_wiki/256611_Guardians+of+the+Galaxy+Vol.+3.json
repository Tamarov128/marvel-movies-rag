But it isn't long before their lives are upended by the echoes of \nRocket\n's turbulent past. \nPeter Quill\n, still reeling from the loss of \nGamora\n, must rally his team around him on a dangerous mission to save Rocket's lifea mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nAdam Warlock\n battles \nDrax\n \n \nWhile the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n restore the outpost on \nKnowhere\n, they put a drunken \nPeter Quill\n mourning the loss of \nGamora\n to sleep. At that moment, \nAdam Warlock\n suddenly attacks the Guardians, who undergo severe injuries when managing to fight him back. The Guardians find \nRocket\n near death when Adam retreats, with Rocket having moments of his past flash before his eyes, meeting \nLylla\n, \nTeefs\n and \nFloor\n from \nBatch 89\n after being experimented on for the first time.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nGuardians\n prepare to infiltrate the \nOrgoscope\n \n \nThe team finds out they can't interact with Rocket, enabling his kill switch, prompting them to find a way to override it and save Rocket by infiltrating \nOrgoCorp\n's, Rocket's experimenters, \nheadquarters\n with help from the \nRavagers\n. Alongside the Ravagers' newest member, \nGamora\n, the Guardians enter the Orgoscope while Adam has returned to the \nHigh Evolutionary\n beside \nAyesha\n, but without Rocket. The High Evolutionary threatens Ayesha to get Rocket back to him before he ends the \nSovereign\n race.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nGuardians\n leave the \nOrgoscope\n damaged\n \n \nRocket remembers bettering the High Evolutionary's way of perfecting life as Peter, Gamora and \nNebula\n get the pass key while \nMantis\n and \nDrax\n get \nGroot\n to allow their escape to the \nBowie\n. Seemingly obtaining what they were looking for, an alarm goes off sending \nOrgosentries\n toward the team. They thwart them and escape from the Orgoscope.\n \n \n \n \n \nGamora\n and \nNebula\n learn of \nTheel\n \n \nRocket has a flashback of him and his friends establishing their names and his promise to travel in a spaceship with them while the Guardians view Rocket's experimentation on the file they got, embedding no pass key. They however find that one of the High Evolutionary's recorders, \nTheel\n, has this key downloaded in his memory. They set out to find him on \nCounter-Earth\n as Ayesha confronts a \nRavager\n, fried by Adam when wanting him to tell Gamora's whereabouts, later following Gamora.\n \n \n \n \n \nStar-Lord\n and \nGroot\n escape \nArte Laboratories\n \n \nUpon the Guardians' arrival, Rocket is reminded of the High Evolutionary's meltdown concerning Rocket's method being proven to be better. He told Rocket he was never meant to live on Counter-Earth with his friends, who would be shot when Rocket tried to save them, escaping afterwards. With Ayesha's incoming arrival, the Guardians asks a resident's help of finding the recorder, being lead toward the \nship\n ahead. Quill and Groot meet the High Evolutionary and the recorder while \nWar Pig\n is sent to capture Rocket, though fought by Gamora. The ship begins to lift off as the High Evolutionary blows Counter-Earth up, leading Quill to leap off of it with Theel when Nebula, Drax and Mantis try and save them.\n \n \n \n \n \nKnowhere\n crashes into \nArte Laboratories\n \n \nRocket sees a vision of his friends, being invited to join them in time, returning to his friends for now. When Nebula, Drax and Mantis are informed, they are held captive by the High Evolutionary, along with his \nStar Children\n, ordering the rest to bring him Rocket. The High Evolutionary's ship is however confronted by the Guardians and Knowhere's cannon. Once the \nHell Spawn\n are released upon the Guardians and Knowhere, and the cannon fires into the laboratory, Drax's, Mantis' and Nebula's cage opens to three \nAbilisks\n Mantis manages to control. Adam Warlock, held captive on Quill and Gamora's ship, faces them when Gamora threatens his pet \nBlurp\n. They escape the ship with Blurp though, landing upon the laboratory's entrance as the ship self-destructs.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nGuardians\n enter \nArte Laboratories\n \n \nEntering the lab, all Guardians fend off the High Evolutionary's troops. They also free every other captive, leading them to Knowhere. Revisiting his former cage, Rocket finds out he is indeed a \nraccoon\n when rescuing a multitude of them. Rocket is soon apprehended by the High Evolutionary, who he fights along with his team members. With the opportunity to end his life, Rocket decides to spare him due to his status as a Guardian of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary would be imprisoned on Knowhere.\n[\n2\n]\n They have the caged animals hop aboard Knowhere as well, but Quill unfortunately loses his \nZune\n, rushing to retrieve it and try to make it back in time. He slowly drifts in space nonetheless, but was saved by Adam Warlock.\n \n \n \n \n \nRocket Raccoon\n leads the new \nGuardians\n \n \nLater, Quill, wanting to spend more time on \nEarth\n, Mantis, seeking independence, Drax, raising the Star Children, Nebula, leading Knowhere, and Gamora, returning to the Ravagers, disband from the team, with Rocket now the leader. The new Guardians of the Galaxy, with Warlock, Blurp and Star Child \nPhyla\n as new additions, embark on a mission on \nKrylor\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nPeter Quill\n meets his \ngrandfather\n again\n \n \nOn Earth, Quill reunites with his grandfather, \nJason Quill\n, that he has not seen since his kidnapping. He'd enjoy breakfast as his grandfather reads a newspaper on \nKevin Bacon\n's \nkidnapping\n. \nCast\n[\n]\nChris Pratt\n as \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nZoe Saldaa\n as \nGamora\nDave Bautista\n as
