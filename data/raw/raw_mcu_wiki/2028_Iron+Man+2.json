He is reluctant to divulge the secrets of his \narmored suit\n, fearing the information will fall into the wrong hands. With \nPepper Potts\n and \n\"Rhodey\" Rhodes\n by his side, Tony must forge new alliances and confront a powerful new \nenemy\n.\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \nIvan Vanko\n builds his first \nWhiplash suit\n \n \nIn \nRussia\n, the national media is televising the news conference in which \nTony Stark\n revealed his identity as Iron Man to the world. During this, a sick \nAnton Vanko\n dies in the arms of his son, \nIvan Vanko\n, telling him that the only thing he has left to leave him is his knowledge, which turn out to be blueprints for the \nArc Reactor\n. He also tells his son that he has every right to the success that Tony Stark and his family has gained, which motivates Ivan to seek revenge on Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n entering at the \nStark Expo\n conference\n \n \nSix months later, Stark continues to use the Iron Man suit to protect people and his fame has increased. He reopens the \nStark Expo\n to fulfill his father's dream of endorsing inventors and inventions that will one day benefit the world. As Stark leaves the stage, he notices that his blood toxicity is rising, accompanied by noticeable, damaged veins around his chest, expanding outward. He keeps this secret from everyone.\n \n \n \n \n \nJustin Hammer\n making his official statement in  \nWashington, D.C.\n \n \nAfter being summoned to attend a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing on the existence and threat of the Iron Man armor, and similar suits being developed in retaliation, Senator \nStern\n demands that he hands his armor technology over for military application. Stark, however, refuses as he says that the Iron Man suit and Tony Stark is the same concept and to give it over would be to turn over himself. He then proves that other attempts by foreign powers to duplicate the Iron Man suit have failed miserably and also embarrasses corporate rival \nJustin Hammer\n, who had testified against him, by showing he had also made a bungled attempted at creating a prototype. Stark then returns home, where \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n confirms that the toxic levels of his blood have risen; the palladium that is powering the Arc Reactor keeping the shrapnel from reaching his heart is slowly killing him and there are no other suitable replacements.\n \n \n \n \n \nPepper Potts\n and \nTony Stark\n at Monaco\n \n \nLater, Stark, thinking he will die, makes \nPepper Potts\n CEO of \nStark Industries\n and makes \nNatalie Rushman\n his new assistant. At the \nMonaco\n Grand Prix, Stark takes out the Formula One driver who is representing Stark Industries and drives it himself, seeking some enjoyment before he dies, despite putting himself in immediate danger. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Vanko, or \nWhiplash\n has gained a pass to the Monaco Grand Prix through the means of his associate, plotting an attack on Stark, using his \nmodified harness with electric whips\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nIvan Vanko\n is given a \npet bird\n from \nJustin Hammer\n \n \nVanko soon appears on the racetrack and attacks the racing cars, knowing Stark would come. Stark puts on the portable \nMark V\n suit and, with the aid of \nHappy Hogan\n, \ndefeats\n Vanko. Stark discovers that Ivan is the son of disgraced Russian physicist Anton Vanko, who collaborated on the first Arc Reactor with Stark's father \nHoward Stark\n. Vanko is later broken out of jail by Justin Hammer who recruits him to help make his own Iron Man suits and gain revenge on Stark by tarnishing his name and image.\n \n \n \n \n \nNick Fury\n keeping tabs on \nTony Stark\n \n \nStark throws what he believes will be his last birthday party and promptly proceeds to get drunk while wearing the \nMark IV armor\n. When Stark begins to endanger his party guests by blasting objects out of the air in their vicinity, his friend Lt. Colonel \nJames Rhodes\n dons the \nMark II\n armor to subdue him. The next day Stark, disgraced and hungover, is approached by \nNick Fury\n of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and Rushman - who in reality is \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who provides him with a \nbox\n of his father's old research that can hopefully be used to find a cure for his \npalladium\n poisoning.\n \n \n \n \n \nHoward Stark\n unveils the new \nStark Expo\n \n \nUsing his father's research, Stark discovers a message from his father that leads him to examine the original 1974 diorama of the \nStark Expo\n: in reality, a disguised diagram for the molecular structure of a new element. Stark hand-builds a \nParticle Accelerator\n with the aid of his computer AI \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n and synthesizes this \nnew element\n, creating a new, perfected Arc Reactor that cures his palladium poisoning. Realizing Hammer's involvement with Vanko, Stark races to the Stark Expo.\n \n \n \n \n \nBlack Widow\n breaks into the \nHammer Industries\n headquarters\n \n \nAt the Stark Expo, Justin Hammer unveils his new military drones, captained by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the confiscated Mark II armor. Unfortunately, it is soon discovered that Vanko has complete control of both the drones and Rhodes's new armor, and Stark arrives just as they go on the attack. Hammer's attempts to regain control of the drones get him placed into NYPD custody. As Stark battles against these remote-controlled enemies, \nHappy Hogan\n and Romanoff race to Hammer's \nHammer Industries Headquarters\n to stop Vanko.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n and \nJames Rhodes\n gets control of his \narmor\n \n \nBy the time they arrive, Vanko has already departed for the Expo in a \nnew, more powerful suit of armor\n, but Romanoff is able to give Rhodes control of his armor again so that he and Stark can fight Vanko together. The two armored allies combine their powers and \nsuccessfully take Vanko down\n, but Vanko's armor and the Hammer Drones are revealed to have been equipped to self-destruct. As they begin to detonate, Stark races to save Potts, flying her to a rooftop where they reconcile and kiss.\n \n \n \n \n \nPhil Coulson\n arrives at the location of an \n0-8-4\n \n \nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that while Stark is \"unsuitable\" for the \nAvengers Initiative\n, S.H.I.E.L.D. wants him as a consultant. Stark agrees on the condition that Senator Stern present him and Rhodes with their medals for bravery. \nMeanwhile\n, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent \nPhil Coulson\n is seen driving to a remote impact crater in the \nNew Mexico\n desert. Over a phone, he informs Fury that they've found \"it\", which is revealed to be a \nmysterious hammer\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nRobert Downey Jr.\n as \nTony Stark/Iron Man\nDavin Ransom\n as Young \nTony Stark\nGwyneth Paltrow\n as \nPepper Potts\nDon Cheadle\n as \nJames Rhodes/War Machine\nScarlett Johansson\n as \nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow\nSam Rockwell\n as \nJustin Hammer\nMickey Rourke\n as \nIvan Vanko/Whiplash\nSamuel L.
