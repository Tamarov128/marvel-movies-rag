But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as \nGorr the God Butcher\n, who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King \nValkyrie\n, \nKorg\n, and ex-girlfriend \nJane Foster\n, who  to Thors surprise  inexplicably wields his magical hammer, \nMjlnir\n, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance and stop him before it's too late.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGorr\n, the last of his people, spends his days striving to survive on a barren desert with his \ndaughter\n. He prays to his god \nRapu\n for help, but his daughter soon dies of starvation. Just as he begins to hear a voice calling out to him in the distance, Gorr discovers an oasis where he finds Rapu, who had killed the latest wielder of an ancient weapon known as \nAll-Black the Necrosword\n. Rapu makes fun of Gorr for his helplessness and refuses to provide any assistance. Feeling betrayed, Gorr claims the Necrosword and beheads him, and vows for the elimination of all gods.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThor\n continues his adventures with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, responding to distress calls across the universe while working to get back in shape. However, Thor remains discontent with where he is in life, and intends to retire. An influx of distress calls regarding Gorr emerge, one of them being from \nSif\n, who had hunted him down. Thor and \nKorg\n respond to Sif's call, parting ways with the Guardians who leave to respond to the others. They find a defeated Sif with her arm severed, who warns them that Gorr will attack \nNew Asgard\n next.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, Dr. \nJane Foster\n undergoes treatment for stage IV cancer. Efforts to research for a cure prove futile and she beings to lose hope, but Foster becomes inspired to travel to New Asgard in hopes that their magic can help eliminate the cancer. As Thor has unknowingly enchanted it to protect Foster while they were together, \nMjlnir\n becomes drawn to her presence, fusing itself back together and imbuing her with the powers of the Mighty Thor.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat night, Gorr uses the Necrosword to swarm New Asgard with \nshadow monsters\n. Thor, Korg, and Sif arrive to confront them, as does King \nValkyrie\n and Foster, who Thor is surprised to see. While they were able to repel the monsters, Gorr escapes with Asgard's children, including \nHeimdall\n's son \nAxl Heimdallson\n. Thor communicates with Axl and deduces that the children are in the \nShadow Realm\n. Knowing that Gorr's strength would be at its peak there, Thor, Mighty Thor, Valkyrie, and Korg travel to \nOmnipotence City\n to warn \nZeus\n of Gorr and ask for an army to help fight him.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnconvinced that Gorr is a threat to Omnipotence City, Zeus instead has Thor captured, forcing the others to intervene and fend off Zeus' men. In the scuffle, Zeus uses his \nThunderbolt\n to destroy Korg's body; only his face remains intact (although this is enough for him to survive). Enraged, Thor uses the Thunderbolt to impale Zeus in the chest, which Valkyrie steals as the group escapes to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster's cancer diagnosis, and the two rekindle their relationship.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUpon arrival, they attempt to locate the children, only to realize that they had fallen for a trap. Gorr intended to take \nStormbreaker\n in order to utilize the \nBifrost Bridge\n to access \nEternity\n, where he can wish for the extinction of the gods. They battle Gorr and his shadow monsters once more, but are forced to flee back to New Asgard once Valkyrie and Mighty Thor are weakened; Before Stormbreaker can be transported across the Bifrost, Gorr steals it. Thor is informed that the effects of Mjlnir are aggravating Foster's cancer, and he urges her to stay behind to recover. Valkyrie is also unable to continue fighting, leaving the Thunderbolt in Thor's possession so that he can fight Gorr again.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the center of the universe, Gorr begins opening Eternity's gate with Stormbreaker. Thor arrives using Thunderbolt and imbues the children with the power of Thor, giving them enough strength to overcome the remaining shadow monsters. Gorr gains the upper hand against Thor. Having sensed his distress, Foster decides to wield Mjlnir again despite her weakened condition and joins the fight through using Valkyrie's \nwinged horse\n. Thor gives Mighty Thor ample time to use Mjlnir to shatter the Necrosword into pieces, dooming herself and Gorr. Thor recovers Stormbreaker and has the children use it to return home, but they could not stop Gorr from entering Eternity.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThor calls out to Gorr and pleads for him to choose love over death as he rushes to Mighty Thor's side. Their love reminded him of the love he had for his daughter, thus deciding to use his wish to resurrect her. Foster soon succumbs to the cancer, vanishing into \nValhalla\n. Thor accepts Gorr's request to take custody of his daughter before he dies from the Necrosword's curse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the aftermath, a statue of Foster as the Mighty Thor was erected in New Asgard. Sif and Valkyrie begin training the children in combat, while Korg's body fully regenerates as he seeks to produce an offspring. Thor starts to raise Gorr's daughter as his own, entrusting her with Stormbreaker while he wields Mjlnir into battle. The two begin travelling the galaxy offering assistance to whomever needs it, becoming known as Love and Thunder. \nIn the meanwhile\n, Zeus begins to recover from his injuries as he sends out his son \nHercules\n to kill Thor. Foster encounters Heimdall in the afterlife, who welcomes her to \nValhalla\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nChris Hemsworth\n as \nThor\nTristan Hemsworth\n as Young \nThor\nSamson Alston\n as Teenage \nThor\nCameron Chapek\n as Baby \nThor\nNatalie Portman\n as \nJane Foster/Mighty Thor\nAva Caryofyllis\n as Young \nJane Foster\nChristian Bale\n as \nGorr the God Butcher\nTessa Thompson\n as \nBrunnhilde/King Valkyrie\nTaika Waititi\n as \nKorg\n /  \nNinny of the Nonny\n / \nSurtur\n \n(archive footage; uncredited)\nRussell Crowe\n as \nZeus\nJaimie Alexander\n as \nSif\nIdris Elba\n as \nHeimdall\n \n(\npost-credits scene\n)\nChris Pratt\n as \nPeter Quill/Star-Lord\nDave Bautista\n as \nDrax the Destroyer\nKaren Gillan\n as \nNebula\nPom Klementieff\n as \nMantis\nSean Gunn\n as \nKraglin Obfonteri\n / \nRocket\n \n(motion capture)\nVin Diesel\n as \nGroot\n \n(voice)\nBradley Cooper\n as \nRocket\n \n(voice)\nCarly Rees\n as \nMiek\nKat Dennings\n as Doctor \nDarcy Lewis\nBrett Goldstein\n as \nHercules\n \n(mid-credits scene)\nStellan Skarsgrd\n as Doctor \nErik Selvig\nLuke Hemsworth\n as \nThor Actor\nMatt Damon\n as \nLoki Actor\nSam Neill\n as \nOdin Actor\nMelissa McCarthy\n as \nHela Actress\nBen Falcone\n as Asgardian Stage Manager\nStephen Curry\n as King \nYakan\nBobby Holland Hanton\n as \nHabooska the Horrible\nDaley Pearson\n as \nDarryl Jacobson\nKieron L.
