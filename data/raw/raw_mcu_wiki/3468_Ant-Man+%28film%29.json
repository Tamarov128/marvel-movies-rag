Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Pym and Lang must plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.\n[\n1\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nPym punches \nMitchell Carson\n in the face\n \n \nIn \n1989\n, \nHank Pym\n resigns from \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n after discovering \nHoward Stark\n's attempt to replicate his own shrinking technology, which Pym believes is very dangerous and vows to suppress it.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \nthe present day\n, Pym's estranged daughter, \nHope van Dyne\n, and protege, \nDarren Cross\n, have forced him from his own company, \nPym Technologies\n. Furthermore, Pym is more devastated when Cross unravels his own project; an advanced shrinking suit named the \nYellowjacket Suit\n, based on Pym's original technology.\nScott Lang\n has been released from \nSan Quentin State Prison\n, after serving three years for burglarizing a former \nemployer\n. He reunites with his former cellmate, \nLuis\n, and his two other partners \nKurt Goreshter\n and \nDave\n, who offer him a position in a burglary; however, Lang explains his intention about going straight. Furthermore, he learns that \nhis ex-wife\n has gotten engaged to a police officer, \nJim Paxton\n. His wife also reveals that he cannot see \ntheir child\n anymore if he does not provide child support.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRelentless, and hopeless, Lang inadvertently accepts the burglary job offered by Luis, when he is unable to strike up a job because of his negative criminal records and background. Lang confidentially infiltrates the house where he is supposed to break into, and cracks open a safe, and finds \nsomething\n which he refers to as an \"old motorcycle suit\". He takes it to his \napartment\n after escaping. He starts toying with it and wears the suit. Triggering a button, he inadvertently shrinks down to the size of an insect and struggles to return to his original size. Terrified by this enigmatically frightening experience, he attempts to return it back to the house where he smuggled it from, only to be discovered by the police, and arrested. Pym, the owner of the house which Lang broke into, poses as a lawyer and smuggles the Ant-Man Suit to Lang's cell to help him break out. Although confused, Lang wears the suit and escapes the prison with the help of a group of ants.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLang discovers that Pym manipulated him through Luis into stealing the suit as a test, and wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man and steal the Yellowjacket suit from Cross, which Pym considers as extremely dangerous equipment, literally capable of mass destruction. Pym requests Van Dyne to spy on Cross, and she does so, although resenting her father for their strained relationship and not saying anything about her mother and also not letting her stop Cross. Meanwhile, Lang is trained by Van Dyne and Pym to perfectly control and manipulate the Ant-Man suit that additionally supplies superhuman strength, while teaching him to control ants.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPym sends Lang to a very risky mission, where he steals a device from the \nAvengers Compound\n, originally one of \nStark Industries\n warehouses, that eventually leads to a \nfight\n between Lang and \nFalcon\n. Later, Pym in frustration, tells Hope the truth about the death of her mother, \nJanet van Dyne\n; her mother was the counterpart of Pym's Ant-Man superhero identity, the Wasp, who sacrificed herself to prohibit a \nSoviet\n nuclear launch missile to be activated; in the process, she disappeared into a subatomic \nQuantum Realm\n. He admits that he does not want the same to happen to Hope; then the two reconcile.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCross perfects the Yellowjacket suit and invites Pym to the unveiling. While the congregation ceremony of the Yellowjacket suit is taking place, Lang, in the Ant-Man suit, along with his crew and a swarm of ants, infiltrates the building. Planting explosives and sabotaging all the servers, Lang is prepared to steal the Yellowjacket Suit; however, he is captured by Cross who was expecting this. Cross sells both the Ant-Man and Yellowjacket suits to \nHYDRA\n and the \nTen Rings\n. Lang breaks free from his trap, fights the HYDRA agents and chases after the escaped Cross, though \nMitchell Carson\n escapes with Cross's unstable formula amidst the chaos. Then, the planted explosives planted on Cross's unstable Pym Particle formula detonate, imploding the building into the Quantum Realm.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCross dons the Yellowjacket suit. Lang traps Cross in a bug zapper, but before he can sabotage his suit, he is tased and arrested by Paxton. Cross escapes, and holds Lang's daughter, Cassie, as a hostage, to lure Lang to him. They both fight once again but as a last effort, Lang shrinks to a subatomic size to finally penetrate and sabotage the Yellowjacket suit. They both shrink uncontrollably in the nothingness of the subatomic quantum realm, with Cross imploding due to his suit being damaged by Scott, who smashed through the suit's mechanisms and circuits as he turned subatomic. Scott, fighting unconsciousness and after hearing Cassie calling for him, finds the will to escape and puts a disc with enlarging Pym Particle formula inside the suit's regulator and switches it back on, successfully reverting to his original size.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWitnessing the heroism of Lang, Paxton covers up for him and wriggles him out of serving time. Scott remembers nothing of his experience in the Quantum Realm, with Pym believing the human mind might not be able to process it. Seeing that Lang survived the Quantum Realm, Pym wonders if his wife is still alive. Months later\n[\n2\n]\n, Luis informs Lang that the \nAvengers\n are looking to recruit him, by the suggestion of Wilson.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter Lang's departure\n, Pym shows the upgraded prototype of the \nWasp Suit\n to Hope, offering it to her. To which she replies, \"it's about damn time\". \nA year later\n, in \nBerlin\n, \nSteve Rogers\n and Wilson have found \nBucky Barnes\n. Unable to contact \nTony Stark\n because of the \"\naccords\n\" prohibiting him, Rogers fears that they are on their own but Wilson states that he knows a \nguy\n who can help them.\nCast\n[\n]\nPaul Rudd\n as \nScott Lang/Ant-Man\nMichael Douglas\n as Doctor \nHank Pym/Ant-Man\nDax Griffin\n as Young \nHank Pym/Ant-Man\nEvangeline Lilly\n as \nHope van Dyne\nCorey Stoll\n as \nDarren Cross/Yellowjacket\nAnthony Mackie\n as \nSam Wilson/Falcon\nBobby Cannavale\n as \nJim Paxton\nJudy Greer\n as \nMaggie Lang\nAbby Ryder Fortson\n as \nCassie Lang\nMichael Pea\n as \nLuis\nDavid Dastmalchian\n as \nKurt Goreshter\nT.I.\n as \nDave\nWood Harris\n as \nGale\nHayley Atwell\n as \nPeggy Carter\nJohn Slattery\n as \nHoward Stark\nMartin Donovan\n as \nMitchell Carson\nGregg Turkington\n as \nDale\nJoe Chrest\n as \nFrank\nHayley Lovitt\n as \nJanet van Dyne/Wasp\nNicholas Barrera\n as \nErnesto\nCarlos Aviles\n as \nCarlos\nLyndsi LaRose\n as \nEmily\nRobert Crayton\n as \nPeachy\nDanny Vasquez\n as \nIgnacio\nRod Hallett\n as \nHYDRA Buyer\nStan Lee\n as \nBartender\nAnna Akana\n as \nWriter\nChris Evans\n as \nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n \n(uncredited; \npost-credits scene\n)\nSebastian Stan\n as \nBucky Barnes/Winter Soldier\n \n(uncredited; post-credits scene)\nWalter Hendrix III\n as \nBrown\n \n(uncredited)\nCesar Mendoza\n as \nGabriel\n \n(uncredited)\nAislinn Williams\n as \nDarby\n \n(uncredited)\nScott Ledbetter\n as \nGreen\n \n(uncredited)\nJonathan S.

Wright also signed to co-write the screenplay, based on a comic book series about an electronics expert who can shrink to the size of an insect and communicate with ants via a telepathic/cybernetic helmet, with his writing partner \nJoe Cornish\n and to co-produce the film with his \nBig Talk Productions\n partner, \nNira Park\n.\nWright and Cornish originally wrote a treatment for Artisan that focused on Scott Lang as a burglar. Artisan, looking for a family-oriented movie, passed on the script. A few years later when Marvel executives \nKevin Feige\n and \nAvi Arad\n asked if Wright was interested in writing a script on any of the Marvel titles, Wright offered the Ant-Man script.\nIn February 2007, Wright reported that the film was in a holding pattern while they worked on revising the script. At that time casting had not been started.\nIn March 2008, Wright told Empire magazine that a second draft of the script was being written. Known for being a comedic writer, the director noted that the film would not be overtly comedic, but that it would be \"more of a full-on action adventure sci-fi film but with a comedic element,\" and that it would not be a spoof. He confirmed that the film portrays both Hank Pym, as the original 1960s character from \"Tales to Astonish\", and Scott Lang as his 1980s/1990s successor in the Ant-Man role.\nWright said the story is very character-driven, and a new twist on an origins story. As part of his writing he researched nanotechnology.\nIn May 2012, a \"teaser\" image of the movie was presented via Twitter by writer and director Edgard Wright. Feige stated as well that the movie was \"as close as its ever been\".\nOn June 28, 2012, it was revealed that Wright had filmed a Test Reel for the film.\nOn October 15, 2012, Marvel and Disney announced that Edgar Wright's Ant-Man would hit theaters on November 6, 2015.\n[\n4\n]\nOn January 25, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the film will be a part of \nPhase Three\n of the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n and will be the film to begin the 3rd phase.\nIn September 2013, Disney moved the film's release date from November 6, 2015, to July 31, 2015.\n[\n5\n]\nIn October 2013, Wright tweeted a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test reel with the caption, \"Now I'm back in LA, it's high time to finish a little something I've been working on\".\nOn December 18, 2013, \nPaul Rudd\n was cast as the lead character, but it was not revealed which version of Ant-Man he will portray.\nOn January 13, \nMichael Douglas\n was cast as Hank Pym and Rudd was confirmed to play Lang. Also in January, Disney changed the release date once again, moving the film up to July 17, 2015, from July 31, 2015.\nOn February 6, 2014, \nEvangeline Lilly\n was announced to be in talks to play the female lead in the film. It was also confirmed that \nMichael Pea\n had been cast in an unspecified role.\nOn May 23, 2014, Edgar Wright announced he would be leaving as director of Ant-Man due to creative differences with Marvel. Variety reported that Marvel knew who they wished to have as a replacement but had not yet begun negotiations.\n[\n6\n]\nOn May 30, 2014, \nAdam McKay\n was asked by Marvel Studios to direct Ant-Man, but he decided to focus on other projects. \n[\n7\n]\nOn June 7, 2014, \nPeyton Reed\n was announced as the new Director of the film. Also in June, \nCorey Stoll\n was revealed to be playing the antagonist \nDarren Cross\n.\nAround July 25, 2014, Patrick Wilson, Kevin Weisman, and \nMatt Gerald\n decided to leave the film, citing scheduling conflicts.\nOn August 18th, filming for Ant-Man began.\nOn December 5th, principal photography for Ant-Man ended.\nOn January 2nd, 2015, Marvel announced that the first trailer would air with the premiere of \nAgent Carter\n in a miniature video.\nMusic\n[\n]\nAnt-Man: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\nSong title\nArtist\nLocation(s)\nVisionary\nHi-Finesse\nTrailer #1.\n2020\nSuuns\nTrailer #2.\nBorombon\nCamilo Azuquita\nOpening fanfare.\nShingalin en Panama\nCamilo Azuquita\n & \nOrquesta Los Embajadores\nScott Lang\n leaves \nSan Quentin State Prison\n to meet \nLuis\n.\nAntmusic\nAdam and the Ants\nIn the background while \nScott\n is serving a customer at \nBaskin-Robbins\n.\nLive It Up\nDi Alo\nLang\n arrives at \nLuis\n' apartment where a group of neighbors are partying.\nLa Cucaracha\nLuis' van\n horn.\nHot Poppin' Popcorn\nThe Wiggles\nCassie Lang\n's birthday party.\nEscape\nRoy Ayers\nLuis\n gives to \nScott Lang\n information about the \nPym Residence\nLuis reveals to Lang that \nSam Wilson\n is looking for him.\nI'm Ready\nCommodores\nScott Lang\n, \nLuis\n, \nDave\n and \nKurt Goreshter\n prepare to rob the \nPym Residence\n.\nOur Time Now\nLove Kelli\nNeighbors are having a party underneath \nLang\n, who is inside the bathroom with the costume.\nPink Gorilla\nHLM\nAnt-Man\n falls into a rave through the floor of the apartment while wearing \nthe suit\n for the first time.\nIt's a Small World\nRichard M.
