I've never experienced loss because I never had a loved one to lose. But what is grief, if not love persevering?\" Vision to Wanda Maximoff[src] Vision was a synthezoid made from vibranium, created by Ultron with the help of Helen Cho, and given life by the powerful artifact known as the Mind Stone. Originally conceived as the perfect form for Ultron, the body was taken by the Avengers before Tony Stark and Bruce Banner proceeded to upload the remnants of Stark's personal A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. into it. Upon his birth, Vision declared he was neither Ultron nor J.A.R.V.I.S., but one that would fight with them to protect humanity. Vision then joined with the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, using his powers to prevent Ultron from transferring his consciousness to the internet, and allowing the Avengers to successfully put an end to his plan. In the wake of the Ultron Offensive, Vision became an official member of the Avengers under Captain America's leadership. However, tension between these Avengers rose following the creation of the Sokovia Accords, as Vision saw the equations regarding the number of threats related to their actions as the reason for them to allow oversight of their actions. This led to a conflict, as Captain America had decided to oppose the Sokovia Accords in order to protect Winter Soldier, who was being framed by Helmut Zemo. Vision was forced to side with Iron Man to bring Captain America and his allies to justice. During their conflict, Vision was involved in a battle which concluded when Vision inadvertently shot War Machine out of the sky, while the Avengers were torn apart by their conflict. Vision then quietly left the Avengers in order to rebuild his relationship with Wanda Maximoff. However, Vision was soon attacked by the Black Order, who were attempting to steal the Mind Stone from his head under the orders from Thanos. Having been rescued by his allies, Vision agreed to have the Mind Stone removed from his head and destroyed, as they traveled to Wakanda to enlist the help of Shuri. Their attempts were unsuccessful, as the Black Order attacked Wakanda, while Corvus Glaive was able to force the wounded Vision into the open. As Thanos arrived, Vision convinced the devastated Wanda Maximoff to destroy the Mind Stone, killing him, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to then resurrect Vision and rip the stone from his head, killing him for a second time as Thanos claimed his victory. Vision's corpse was taken by S.W.O.R.D. and disassembled in an attempt to weaponize his remains. Vision's body was then reassembled in a white form and reactivated through a sample of Maximoff's Chaos Magic, and was employed by S.W.O.R.D. as their sentient weapon. Initially programmed to eliminate Maximoff and another Vision, Vision's memories were restored, prompting him to flee.

For an abridged overview, see Marvel Database's article on the same character. Creation and Siege[] Given Life by the Mind Stone[] \"The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue; it can't build a living body.\"\"It can, you can. You lacked the materials.\" Helen Cho and Ultron[src] Vision is built in the Regeneration Cradle During an attempt to create a more powerful body, Ultron manipulated Doctor Helen Cho to use the Regeneration Cradle for the creation of his new body. Under the control of the Scepter, she used the machine to create the body, combining artificial organic tissue with vibranium supply that Ultron bought from Ulysses Klaue. He later broke the Scepter to claim the jewel, so he could use its power to evolve into a perfect body. When the Avengers arrived aiming to stop him, Ultron was forced to flee before he could finish uploading his mind into the body, knocking out Cho and killing her staff in the process while his only allies, the Maximoff twins, betrayed him upon realizing his genocidal intentions. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner discuss Vision During a chase through the streets of Seoul, the Cradle was juggled around until it was recovered by the Avengers and taken to Avengers Tower in New York City. Upon examination, Tony Stark chose the idea of repurposing the body rather than destroying it like the team desired as it would be a more beneficial choice. He convinced a reluctant Bruce Banner to help him and together, the pair then uploaded the recently recovered J.A.R.V.I.S. A.I. into the body.[2] Part of a Vision[] Vision's body is given life by Thor's lightning \"He must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net. We have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended.\" Vision to the Avengers[src] As the procedure of installing J.A.R.V.I.S. neared completion, Captain America, Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff returned to the Avengers Tower and a violent dispute erupted. At the last moment, Thor arrived and sent lightning from Mjlnir into the Cradle. The surge in power sped up the development process, bringing the body to life. The being was initially confused and attacked Thor who defended himself by launching his attacker through the air; however, the being paused and calmed down seconds later. Vision sees his reflection for the first time The synthetic being then took some time to examine his reflection before apologizing for its actions and then offered its gratitude to Thor before adopting elements of the god of thunder's look, unveiling its ability to generate synthetic cells on him by producing a cape and gauntlets. Thor explained to the Avengers that the being's powers were created by the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones with powers that can transcend both time and space. Vision speaks calmly with the Avengers Thor went on to point out that the gemstone which was implanted at the center of the synthetic's forehead was indeed the source of their troubles and the solution. Captain America and the other Avengers were then understandably concerned, but the newly anointed \"Vision\" explained that he was not a child of Ultron. Vision then declared he was not Ultron or J.A.R.V.I.S., rather he was something altogether new and, unlike Ultron, had a deep abiding respect for life. Vision hands Mjlnir over to Thor Although Bruce Banner remained skeptical as to which side Vision was on, to which the synthetic explained that he was on the side of life, he went on to say that Ultron was waiting for them in Sokovia. He then stated that Ultron would now spread his furious rage across the globe. Finishing, he casually lifted Mjlnir and offered it back to Thor, much to the bewilderment of everyone in the room. This action alone was enough to convince them that Vision was not hostile.[2] Preparing for Battle[] Vision speaks to Thor about his new life \"Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.\"\"That's true, he hates you the most.\" Tony Stark and Vision[src] As they prepared to depart for the upcoming battle, with many of the team getting their weapons and uniforms ready, Vision took time to speak to Thor on the outside of Avengers Tower away from the rest of the team. While Tony Stark spoke to his team, he mentioned that Ultron was waiting for him; as he walked past, Vision confirmed this by reminding him that Ultron hated him the most out of the rest of the Avengers. Vision listens to Captain America's speech Vision was present alongside the Avengers in addition to Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff while Captain America began his speech on what they would face upon their arrival in Sokovia, and that there would undoubtedly be consequences. Vision listened as Rogers explained exactly what Ultron's plan would be, noting that their main priority would be evacuating the people of Novi Grad before they engaged with his seemingly unstoppable Ultron Sentry army.[2] Battle of Sokovia[] Locking Ultron Out[] Vision confronts Ultron \"My Vision. They really did take everything from me.\"\"You set the terms, you can change them.\" Ultron and Vision[src] In Sokovia, as Ultron unleashed his army of Ultron Sentries upon the city of Novi Grad. While Captain America organized the evacuation of the city, Vision confronted his creator as the activation for the drill emerged from the ground. Ultron expressed his sorrow at seeing that the Avengers had taken everything from him, even his own body that he designed. Vision locks Ultron out of the internet Vision pleaded to Ultron that he could change all this on his terms, to which Ultron simply replied by attempting to strangle Vision. Vision took the opportunity to hack into Ultron's programming and disable his ability to enter the internet, as Tony Stark had said that doing this would ensure that Ultron would be unable to escape by transferring his mind through the internet, therefore forcing him to only use his other bodies to continue living during the battle. Vision is knocked out by the process While the attempt was successful and Ultron from this point on was trapped in the city and unable to transfer his mind elsewhere, the process incapacitated Vision, rendering him unconscious. Having discovered what had just happened to him and in a fit of rage, Ultron slammed the synthetic into the ground before activating the key and raising Novi Grad high into the sky, promising to destroy the earth as revenge for losing his own vision of the future.[2] Protecting the Key[] Vision hits Ultron with Mjlnir \"It's terribly well-balanced.\"\"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing.\" Vision and Thor[src] Despite his nearly fatal battle with his creator, Vision was able to recover. Exploring the battlefield, Vision discovered Ultron was attempting to beat Thor to death. Thor distracted the robot with an overlong speech, allowing Vision to strike Ultron away with a hit from Mjlnir before returning it to Thor. The pair took a moment to discuss the weight and balance of the mighty hammer as he returned it to Thor. Vision prepares to battle the Ultron Sentries Vision and Thor destroyed several more of the Ultron Sentries before gathering alongside the rest of the Avengers inside the church, where Iron Man informed them that their mission would be to protect the key at all costs, if it was activated, then the entire city would be dropped to Earth and all human life would be wiped out in the explosion. Ultron confronted the Avengers as he assembled a massive armada of his drones and unleashed them upon the team. Vision destroys an Ultron Sentry A great battle between the Avengers and Ultron's army ensued with Vision contributing greatly by dismembering the Ultron drones using his density-altering powers, working in considerable tandem with the other Avengers as they prevented Ultron and the drones from reaching the activation device. Despite the overwhelming numbers of the Sentries, the combined strength of the Avengers pushed them back and reduced their numbers significantly. Vision, Iron Man and Thor damage Ultron Ultron intervened directly and found himself grappling with Vision, the two engaging in a midair struggle. Here, Vision unveiled his ability to fire a beam of energy from the Mind Stone and blasted Ultron away. Soon, Thor and Iron Man joined him as they unleashed beams of lightning and repulsor blasts respectively against Ultron, slowly melting away his shell before they stopped. Weakened and damaged, Ultron was soon punched away by the Hulk. Vision assists War Machine battling Ultron With Ultron's main body seemingly defeated, the remaining Sentries attempted to flee out of the city, which would allow Ultron to live on through them. Under Iron Man's order, Vision joined War Machine in destroying the remaining Ultron drones, using both physical force and beams from the Mind Stone subdue the remaining robots. Watching Vision's sudden and effective attack in the battle, War Machine was left stunned. Vision quickly saves Wanda Maximoff As the Avengers made their way to the Lifeboats to evacuate, Ultron attacked once again, killing Quicksilver. Driven into the rage, Wanda Maximoff abandoned her duty of watching the key and destroyed Ultron's main form, allowing one of his few remaining drones to activate the key and drop Novi Grad out of the sky. As Iron Man and Thor prepared to destroy the city, Vision flew to Maximoff's aid, taking the girl in his arms before flying her out of danger.[2] Destroying Ultron[] Vision confronts Ultron's final living body \"But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.\"\"You're unbearably naive.\"\"Well, I was born yesterday.\" Vision and Ultron[src] By the end, Ultron was able to escape by downloading himself into one final drone body. Vision confronted the drone as it was pulling itself out of the crater where Novi Grad once stood, and pointed out that Ultron was afraid of death as he was the last of his kind. The robot mocked Vision, claiming Tony Stark wanted a savior but settled for a slave. Vision attempts to reason with Ultron Despite it being meant as an insult, Vision did not deny that Stark meant him as a slave, noting that they were both disappointments. Vision stated that the Humans are odd, thinking that order and chaos are opposites and that they try to control what cannot be, but they have grace in their failings, something that Vision believed Ultron missed during his own analysis of the human behavior, which led him to try to wipe them out in his own apocalypse. Vision destroys the final Ultron body Ultron then claimed that the humans were doomed; although Vision sorrowfully agreed to this statement, he proclaimed it a privilege to be among humanity for as long as they would last. Ultron responded by calling Vision unbearably nave, but Vision just simply smiled and countered by saying that he had only been born yesterday. Angered, Ultron attempted to attack, only for Vision to destroy him completely with an energy beam, thus ending the threat of Ultron.[2] New Avengers[] Joining the Team[] Vision arrives at the Avengers Compound \"We've got some hitters.\"\"They're good. They're not a team.\"\"Let's beat 'em into shape\" Black Widow and Captain America[src] Vision was recruited formally into the Avengers once the Battle of Sokovia ended, and traveled to the Avengers Compound along with the other chosen members including Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson and James Rhodes, beginning their training under the leadership of Captain America and Black Widow.[2] While Vision did not always accompany the team on every mission due to his appearance, he continued to advise the team due to J.A.R.V.I.S.' mind while being ready for battle.[1] Bonding with Wanda Maximoff[] Vision tries to comfort Wanda Maximoff \"Wanda, I don't presume to know what you're feeling, but I would like to know. Should you wish to tell me. Should that be of some comfort to you.\" Vision to Wanda Maximoff[src] Shortly after moving into the Avengers Compound, Wanda Maximoff was still grieving the loss of her brother Pietro, and would watch sitcoms in her bedroom to comfort herself. When she sensed Vision on the other side of the wall, he entered and apologized for intruding, but she asked him to sit next to her so he could accompany her in watching sitcoms. Vision bonds more with Wanda Maximoff As Wanda watched the sitcoms, Vision encouraged her to open up about her traumatic past, learning from Wanda that the trauma that is deeply engrained in her life would always find a way back into her consciousness. Vision shared that due to being an artificial creation of life, he was unable to grasp the knowledge of what loss, sorrow, or grief is, for he never had any real familial connection. When Vision stated that grief is love persevering, he and Wanda began to form a close, emotional bond, and in turn, she started to develop strong feelings for him. They then continued to enjoy watching sitcoms together.[5] Attack of Ultimo[] Vision faces off against Ultimo \"Hey, Vision, let's try this move on more time.\"\"Right you are, Colonel Rhodes.\" War Machine and Vision[src] While Vision was admiring a butterly as he flew around the Avengers Compound, the Avengers were called to a small town in Europe to deal with Ultimo, a giant robot created by HYDRA out of Ultron parts. Initially, the team struggled against the robot, but they were quickly able to work together to defeat Ultimo, with Vision teaming up with War Machine.[6] Avengers Civil War[] Sokovia Accords[] Vision announces Thaddeus Ross' arrival \"Our very strength invites challenge, challenge incites conflict, and conflict breeds catastrophe. Oversight... oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.\" Vision to the Avengers[src] Having learned that Tony Stark had arrived in the Avengers Compound, Vision phased through Wanda Maximoff's bedroom wall to inform her and Steve Rogers of this, with Maximoff berating him for phasing through the wall rather than using the door. Vision apologized and noted that Stark had brought the Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross with him. Vision learns of the Sokovia Accords Vision joined the rest of the Avengers as Ross explained that in the aftermath of their recent mission when Crossbones caused several civilian deaths, as well as the devastating consequences of the Avengers actions during the Battle of New York and the Ultron Offensive, the United Nations created the Sokovia Accords which would give them control over the Avengers actions, aiming to ensure less civilian casualties and property damage in the future. Vision justifies the Sokovia Accords Having sat down with the other Avengers to discuss the Accords, Vision listened as Sam Wilson and James Rhodes each argued for and against the concept. Vision accepted the terms, recalling that since Stark became Iron Man, a domino effect of effects has taken place where more enhanced individuals have made their presence known. The Duel of Harlem, Battle at Stark Expo, Battle of Puente Antiguo, Chitauri Invasion, Extremis, Battle of Greenwich, HYDRA, Ultron, Inhuman Outbreak; since these events, the number of enhanced individuals has grown. The Avengers opened the door for others to challenge them, and the Accords would be a safety measure to prevent a future catastrophe.[1] Guarding Wanda Maximoff[] Vision attempts to cook for Wanda Maximoff \"And what do you want?\"\"For people to see you... as I do.\" Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src] As the Avengers were now on the hunt for the Winter Soldier abroad, Wanda Maximoff and Vision stayed behind at the Avengers Compound. Vision tried to make her comfortable, attempting to cook her a meal, which failed since Vision had never eaten anything before. The two discussed their abilities and how they viewed themselves, with Vision noting he did not fully understand the Mind Stone that gave him his power. However, he did add that he would hope to understand it completely one day, so he would no longer fear it. Vision stops Maximoff leaving the facility Despite their pleasant conversation, when Maximoff tried to leave, Vision stopped her, telling her that she was confined to the facility for her own safety. Although, Maximoff tried to tell him that she could look after herself and did not need protection, Vision further explained that the protection was not just for her, telling her that after her mistake in Lagos, she was confined to the facility for a reason of safety at the request of Tony Stark. Maximoff then turned to Vision, asking him what he wanted out of her confinement in which Vision promised that he only wanted the rest of the world to look fondly at her like he did.[1] Losing Wanda Maximoff[] Vision attempts to protect Wanda Maximoff \"Clint! You should not be here.\"\"Really? I retired for, what, like five minutes? And it all goes to shit.\"\"Please consider the consequences of your actions.\" Vision and Hawkeye[src] When the situation involving the Sokovia Accords aftermath got worse, Steve Rogers sent Clint Barton to rescue Wanda Maximoff from the Avengers Compound. Barton set off an explosion outside to lure Vision out to investigate while he greeted his friend and explained the situation to her, though Maximoff remained nervously hesitant. Vision walks straight into Hawkeye's trap While Maximoff considered if she should leave or not, Vision returned and greeted Barton, noting that he should not be there. Taking a lighter stance on the situation, Barton joked that everything had clearly gone wrong since the moment he retired from the Avengers. While they spoke, Vision soon fell into Hawkeye's electric arrow trap which caused him to become trapped by an electric net while Barton tried to make his way outside. Vision attempts to subdue Hawkeye Eventually, Vision escaped the trap by shooting the arrow, and Hawkeye tried to fight back against Vision to no avail, turning his bow into a bow staff to fight with. Despite his best efforts, Barton proved that he was no match for the vibranium-armored Vision, who used his powers to dodge all Barton's attacks before quickly restraining him and reminding him that he could not overpower him and should surrender before the situation got worse. Vision is overpowered by Wanda Maximoff Hawkeye, however, remained confident and noted that although he could not overpower Vision, there was somebody else who could. Much to Vision's horror, Maximoff then used her own powers to control the Mind Stone and forced Vision to phase, making him free Barton. Despite Vision trying to reason with her, Maximoff used her powers to slam Vision through the facility and deep underground, allowing Barton and Maximoff to then escape.[1] Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport[] Vision stands beside Iron Man's team \"Captain Rogers, I know you believe what you are doing is right, but for the collective good, you must surrender now.\" Vision to Captain America[src] Vision was the last of the Avengers to arrive at the airport on Iron Man's side as the teams clashed; when he arrived, Vision created a warning line by firing a beam from the Mind Stone on his forehead in front of Captain America's team. He tried to talk and reason with Rogers to convince him to surrender, noting while Rogers believed he was doing the right thing by going against the Sokovia Accords, he should surrender. Vision overlooks the battle field Knowing that his own power was too great compared to his friends, Vision kept in midair during the clash, as he did not want to hurt any of his former comrades and only planned to take them into custody alive. He did, however, attempt to shoot Falcon down to the ground, but was stopped by an electric arrow fired by Hawkeye. Vision watched from the air to ensure that nobody escaped the battlefield without being captured by him first. Vision saves Black Panther's life When Ant-Man transformed himself into Giant-Man, Iron Man's team momentarily focused on Giant-Man rather than capturing Captain America and the Winter Soldier. While Giant-Man wreaked havoc, Vision finally intervened when Giant-Man kicked an airport bus towards Black Panther, Vision quickly blocked the bus with his vibranium body and then smashed his own body hard into Giant-Man's chest, causing him to fall backward into an airplane. Vision attempts to stop Captain America Vision, seeing Captain America and Winter Soldier try to escape to a Quinjet, became transparent, moving through Giant-Man, and used his Energy Blast to bring down a watch tower, trying to cut off their escape. However, he discovered it was kept in the air due to the intervention of Wanda Maximoff, who used her powers to stop it falling until War Machine used a sonic blast to subdue her, causing the tower to fall although Rogers and Barnes managed to escape. Vision comforts the injured Wanda Maximoff Rather than going after the escaping fugitives, who were negotiating with Black Widow over if they could pass or not, Vision instead went to the aid of Maximoff, who was still recovering from War Machine's sonic blast. Holding her, both Maximoff and Vision apologized to each other for being on opposing sides and for their previous actions against each other at the Avengers Compound. Vision said to Maximoff that the situation was a catastrophe, just as he predicted it would be when he first heard Thaddeus Ross explaining the concept of the Sokovia Accords to them all only a few days early. Vision accidentally shoots War Machine Interrupted their conversation, War Machine asked for assistance to stop the Falcon, who was shooting at him to try and ensure that both Captain America and the Winter Soldier escaped safely. Distracted by talking with Maximoff, Vision looked up and unleashed an Energy Blast aimed at Falcon, but Falcon saw the blast coming and moved out of the way and instead it struck War Machine directly in his power core, causing him to plummet to the ground. Vision flies towards War Machine's aid Despite the best efforts of Iron Man and Falcon to save him, they were not fast enough and War Machine crashed into the ground below. Vision soon flew to Rhodes' location beside Stark and an unconscious Wilson to see him unconscious and paralyzed, with F.R.I.D.A.Y. noting that there was still a faint heartbeat. Seeing this, Vision was mortified and began questioning himself more about what he was and how this accident could have happened.[1] Aftermath[] Vision overlooks James Rhodes' recovery \"How did this happen?\"\"I became distracted.\"\"I didn't think that was possible.\"\"Neither did I.\" Tony Stark and Vision[src] With the fight having now concluded, Vision was at the Avengers Compound, checking on James Rhodes' state while his spine was x-rayed. Tony Stark asked how Vision could make a mistake like that, and Vision admitted he was distracted. Vision stayed with Rhodes while Stark spoke with Natasha Romanoff. Vision sits alone at Avengers Compound While Stark dealt with Captain America, whose team was locked up at the Raft under the orders of Thaddeus Ross, Vision remained behind, fearful that he could make another near fatal mistake. Vision spent time at the Avengers Compound where Rhodes had started to recover, sitting in front of the chess board, considering the future of the Avengers.[1] When Stark gave Peter Parker the chance to join the Avengers, Parker was offered the room next to Vision's.[7] Vision decided to move with Wanda Maximoff to Scotland and the two started a secret life together, while Vision lived a double-life at the Avengers Compound. Despite the circumstances of the splitting of the Avengers and Vision and Maximoff belonging to different teams, they had secretly been dating for two years since the Avengers Civil War. When Vision would stay with Maximoff, he would take a human form and turn off any trackers, so the two could be with each other in peace.[8][9] Infinity War[] In Hiding and Finding Love[] Vision speaks with Wanda Maximoff \"Tell me what you feel.\"\"I just feel you.\" Vision and Wanda Maximoff[src] One night in 2018, Vision began to feel an alert from the Mind Stone in his forehead. Maximoff became concerned and asked if it was the Stone in which Vision replied that it was as if it was speaking to him. He asked Maximoff to use her powers and tell him what she felt. She claimed that all she felt was him and the two embraced each other. Vision spending time with Wanda Maximoff During a walk, Vision suggested the idea of running off and starting an official life together, running away from all their responsibilities. Maximoff was unsure of the idea, given their promises made to their own separate teams. He told her that those were promises they made to other people - not to one another. Vision was unsure of the words to use convince her and began stuttering, but Maximoff assured him by affirming that their relationship would work. He then asked her to stay with him. Before she could give him an official response, they turned and saw an SBN news report about an attack on New York City by Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian. Attacked by the Black Order[] Vision is violently attacked by Corvus Glaive \"I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.\" Vision to Wanda Maximoff[src] With the report that Tony Stark had gone missing, Vision, having lately felt as the Mind Stone was warning him about something, realized that the aliens who attacked New York were coming after the Mind Stone from his forehead. Vision told Maximoff that he had to leave Scotland immediately, but Maximoff was reluctant to let him leave because she knew his life would be put at significant risk if the news report was true. Moments before he was about to reply to her, Vision was then suddenly stabbed by Corvus Glaive and attacked by Proxima Midnight. Once Maximoff was knocked away, Vision's internal systems began to fail. Glaive quickly seized the chance to put his spear against the Mind Stone in an attempt to painfully extract it from Vision's head. Vision fighting against Corvus Glaive After her recovery, Maximoff got up and attacked both Glaive and Midnight. Maximoff attempted to escape with Vision and temporarily hide from Glaive and Midnight where Vision informed her that the blade he was stabbed with stopped him from phasing and that his systems were failing. The two were quickly found by their ambushers where Maximoff had begun combat with Midnight below, Vision began to fight Glaive where he and Glaive pinned each other against buildings. Vision became enraged after Glaive tried to reason with him by bargaining Maximoff's life in exchange for the Mind Stone, so he threw Glaive onto a church where the two further engaged in combat. Vision is protected by Wanda Maximoff Unfortunately, Vision became subdued after Glaive used his glaive to deflect a beam that Vision fired from the Mind Stone which allowed Glaive to continue his attempts to extract the Stone. Maximoff immediately came to Vision's aid, and attempted to escape with him again by flight until the two were blasted out of the air by Midnight and thrown down into a metro station. Vision, unable to escape after being critically wounded, told Maximoff to run for her own safety, but she refused. With Vision at his weakest and Maximoff struggling to both keep Vision safe and hold her own at the same time, Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon arrived just in time to save them.[8] Contemplating His Fate[] Vision is offered some aid by the Avengers \"I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps... its molecular integrity will fail.\"\"Yeah, and you with it. We're not having this conversation.\" Vision and Wanda Maximoff[src] Having reunited with his allies, Vision and Wanda Maximoff were taken back to the Avengers Compound, where they interrupted James Rhodes' meeting with Thaddeus Ross. With the wounded Vision being helped to stand by Sam Wilson, he witnessed Rhodes turning his back on Ross and the Sokovia Accords, agreeing to help them in their new conflict, as the remaining Avengers also reunited with Bruce Banner, who had also returned. Vision explains his solution to Maximoff While at the Avengers Compound, Banner discussed how to fix Vision's internal parts and what to do with the Mind Stone. Vision suggested that Maximoff should destroy the Stone since her power was the only capable force that could eliminate it, as her powers also came from the Infinity Stones. Maximoff refused, calling it too high of a price to pay. Vision, however, reminded them that Thanos had already threatened half of the universe and insisted his one life is worth saving millions. Vision is brought up to Wakanda Despite hearing Maximoff's decision, Vision still countered with any plans his teammates would propose, telling them they cannot take a chance with one life with half of the universe being at stake. Banner then told that Vision was made up of a variety of sources besides the Mind Stone such as J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony Stark as well as himself and that perhaps if they could remove the Stone, then most of Vision himself would be left. Banner, however, told them that he was unable to do the extraction. Steve Rogers then told that he would know a place where Vision could have the treatment done. Refuge in Wakanda[] Vision getting examined by Shuri When arriving in Wakanda, Vision was examined by Shuri, who told them that she could extract the Stone from Vision's head without losing too much of his conscious. While she knew what to do, she needed a significant amount of time to do it since Vision's internal nerves could be easily damaged during the procedure. As two trillion neurons connected the Mind Stone to Vision's processing neural network, Shuri needed to remove those trillions of connections and reroute them so the Mind Stone could be safely removed and destroyed without damaging Vision. Later on, however, Okoye reported that multiple space ships were descending for Wakanda. Black Panther and Rogers' team readied up for battle so they could spare time for Vision being freed from the Stone.[8] Battle of Wakanda[] Vision getting treatment for his procedure \"We don't trade lives, Captain.\" Vision to Steve Rogers[src] During the Outrider onslaught, Wanda Maximoff stayed beside Vision during his treatment. However, she was forced to join the battlefield when she saw her teammates being gradually overpowered. Seeing that Maximoff had left Vision's side, Proxima Midnight signaled Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision. Vision impales Glaive with his own weapon While still being examined, Vision noticed that Shuri and her guards were attacked before the Stone's extraction from his body could be complete. After Shuri was tossed aside, Vision furiously attacked Glaive and was thrown into the battlefield, but Glaive cunningly stabbed him with his glaive again and he was left severely wounded once more. Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner came to his aid as Maximoff had entered combat with Midnight. Despite being told to escape, Vision rescued Rogers from being killed by Glaive and was reunited with Maximoff.[8] Destruction[] Vision tells Maximoff to destroy the stone \"If he gets the stone, half the universe dies. It's not fair. It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me... I just feel you. It's all right. It's all right. I love you.\" Vision to Wanda Maximoff[src] Unfortunately, their victory was short-lived as Vision winced when the Mind Stone warned him that Thanos himself had arrived at Wakanda. Rogers, Black Widow, Falcon, Black Panther, Okoye, War Machine, Winter Soldier, Groot, and Rocket all attempted to stop Thanos, despite Vision being aware that their attempts were futile. Alone with Maximoff, Vision told Maximoff that she had no other choice but to destroy the Stone. Knowing it would destroy him, Maximoff refused. Vision comforted and reasoned her, telling her that he knew the choice she had to make was not fair but that half the universe was presently in danger and they were out of time. He promised she would never hurt him and assured to her that as she would use her powers he would only feel her. Vision being resurrected by Thanos Maximoff tearfully unleashed a stream of energy into the Stone as the other Avengers tried to stop Thanos in a futile effort. As Thanos began to draw closer, Maximoff unleashed two streams of energy into the Stone from both of her hands as Vision softly tried to comfort her by telling her that it was all right while she was breaking down in tears. As she began to break the Stone, Vision spoke to her as she was killing him and let a whispered remark as \"I love you\" to Maximoff as he was dying. Maximoff then successfully shattered the Mind Stone and destroyed Vision along with it in an explosion. Thanos removes the Mind Stone from Vision Despite Vision's sacrifice, Thanos used the Time Stone to reverse time and restore Vision back into existence to be able to retrieve Vision's stone. Maximoff, horrified, attempted to stop him, but Thanos subdued Maximoff and lifted Vision from the ground with a single hand. Powerless to do anything to stop Thanos after his several injuries beforehand, Vision could only watch while Thanos ripped the Mind Stone out of his head, immediately shattering part of his synthetic head and draining all life from him. This effectively killed Vision once and for all. Tossing Vision's colorless and lifeless body aside, Thanos inserted the Mind Stone into his now completed Infinity Gauntlet. Vision's body is left on the ground Despite Thor's last attempt to defeat Thanos, Thanos survived being impaled by Stormbreaker and quickly used the Infinity Gauntlet to eradicate half of all life in the universe with the simple snap of his fingers. After Thanos escaped Wakanda, Maximoff mournfully sat next to Vision's dead body until she disintegrated into dust. Rogers and the original Avengers all gathered around Vision's body in defeat.[8] Following his death, Vision's corpse was brought back to the United States of America, where it eventually fell under S.W.O.R.D.'s possession. For the next five years, Vision would be experimented upon under supervision of Acting Director Tyler Hayward after countless attempts to bring him back online as a new sentient weapon, but to no avail each time as they could not find a sufficient power source.[5] Legacy[] Avenged[] \"You took everything from me.\" Wanda Maximoff to Thanos[src] In 2023, after being resurrected in the Blip, Wanda Maximoff exacted vengeance on the Mad Titan, unaware that he was not the Thanos who had killed Vision but rather a variant Thanos who had come to their timeline from an alternate 2014. During their fight, she very nearly succeeded in killing him. Maximoff was the only one to come close to killing Thanos single-handedly during the Battle of Earth due to her vengeance for Vision's death. Later, Maximoff and Clint Barton mourned Natasha Romanoff and Vision in private by the lake of the Stark Eco-Compound. Barton wished there were a way he could tell Romanoff that they won, but Maximoff assured him, albeit indirectly, that both Romanoff and Vision knew in their sacrifice that they would win.[10] Post-Mortem[] Project Cataract[] Vision's corpse is dissected by S.W.O.R.D. \"We're dismantling the most sophisticated, sentient weapon ever made.\"\"But Vision's not a weapon. You can't do this.\"\"In fact, it is our legal and ethical obligation.\" Tyler Hayward and Wanda Maximoff[src] In 2023, two weeks after the Blip, Wanda Maximoff entered S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters and was shown Vision's dismembered body by Hayward. Unable to feel any life in his remains, she left without further incident.[5] Reactivation[] White Vision is awakened by Tyler Hayward \"We took this thing apart and put it back together again a million times. Tried every type of power supply under the sun, when all we needed was a little energy directly from the source.\" Tyler Hayward[src] Vision's body was reassembled by S.W.O.R.D. and was transported to the S.W.O.R.D. Retreat Base outside of Westview, New Jersey. Using traces of Chaos Magic found on their dismantled S.W.O.R.D. Drone, Vision was reactivated as White Vision.[5] Hayward deployed Vision to terminate Maximoff and the Vision she created in the Hex. Inside Westview, an intense fight ensued between the Hex Vision and the White Vision. However, at a stand still, the Hex Vision managed to restore Vision's memories to White Vision. With his memories restored, White Vision declared that he is the true Vision and flew away from Westview in order to process what just happened.[11] Remembered[] At the end of the 20232024 school year, students at Midtown School of Science and Technology paid tribute to the fallen Avengers (including Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff, Steve Rogers, and Vision) when most of the world had no knowledge that Vision was reactivated as White Vision.[12] Personality[] \"Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites and... try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.\" Vision to Ultron[src] According to Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, Vision's personality is an amalgam of their own, Ultron's and J.A.R.V.I.S.' and an unknown amount of variables derived from the Mind Stone. Vision is a polite, calm, and thinking being, in a similar manner to J.A.R.V.I.S., shown when he apologizes to the Avengers and the twins after just being brought to life. Unlike Ultron, he values all forms of life. He is also shown to be blunt when Vision told Stark that Ultron hates him the most. He prefers to reason with his enemies, and will only attack when threatened. However, when he was first created, Vision lunged at Thor, who was the first person he saw, though only because he felt confused about his surroundings as he glanced around. When Vision encountered Ultron for the final time, both admitted that they cannot understand humans, whom they view as doomed to die out. However, Vision can see the beauty in humanity, due to their potential and imagination, and was happy to serve alongside them. He also regretted having to destroy Ultron, recognizing the latter as \"unique\" and \"in pain\", but he ultimately knew that it was necessary, given the great threat that Ultron posed to humanity. Vision showed a great desire to directly protect life, shown when he defended humans from Ultron and his forces, and when he personally saved Wanda Maximoff from Novi Grad's destruction, as it was blown up by Thor and Iron Man. Vision frequently struggles to understand human behavior; due to being a non-human sentient life-form; as such he tends to come off as awkward or uncomfortable to others, such as when he casually phased through a wall and interrupted a talk between Rogers and Maximoff instead of using a door. He makes judgments based on logic and treats choices as equations, and makes decisions based on what his calculations deem as the best choice or the lesser of two evils. This is best seen when he agrees to the Sokovia Accords by analyzing the relationship between the Avengers and threats to the world as an algorithm which describes the correlation between both concluding that oversight was a good idea. Despite that, Vision continuously attempts to improve his understanding of the human mind and therefore attempted to open up to Maximoff and comfort her over her fears over her powers. Despite his feelings towards Maximoff, the events leading up to and during the Avengers Civil War make it clear he was more loyal to Tony Stark and the people of Earth than to her. As a result of his supercomputer brain, he followed the most logical options available immediately being able to see the Accords as the path of least resistance when it came to helping the people of the world. Much like Stark, he was very pragmatic and selfless should the situation call for it suggesting the destruction of the Mind Stone as a way to prevent Thanos from completing his goals in spite of such an act potentially costing Vision his own life, insisting that one life couldn't stand in the way of defeating Thanos. Befitting his status as one of the few capable of wielding Mjlnir, Vision was capable of great mercy, outright stating he did not wish to kill Ultron in his first few minutes of life. He again displayed this attitude during the Avengers Civil War, acknowledging that Rogers and his faction believed themselves to be in the right while also taking great care to limit his powers so as to minimize any harm that might befall the rogues, even comforting Wanda Maximoff after she fell. After the Avengers conflict, Vision reached out to Maximoff over the next two years in an attempt to mend their relationship. Vision began to grow intense feelings for Maximoff during their time together, and he would develop a human form and even turn off his trackers so he could be with her. Vision even bought a plot of land for Maximoff and himself where they would \"grow old in\", showing how much he felt for her. During his sacrifice, where Maximoff had to destroy the Mind Stone before Thanos could seize it, he tenderly comforted her and told her that she would never hurt him. While she was breaking down into tears as he was dying, he uttered his last words which confessed to her that he loved her, showing his evolution in human understanding to where he could understand what it means to love someone and to be able to openly express that in his last moments. Powers and Abilities[] Powers[] \"He's more than that. He's evolving.\" Tony Stark to Bruce Banner[src] Synthezoid Physiology/Mind Stone Enhancement: Vision is a sapient construct, a perfect hybrid between organic and inorganic material. His entire body is a mix between vibranium and synthetic simulacrum of organic tissue created by Helen Cho, all of which were enhanced by the cosmic powers of the Mind Stone to function as a living body. Originally, the body was designed to be Ultron's final form. The combination of the vibranium and the cosmic energy from the Mind Stone embedded in his forehead not only gives him life, but also grants Vision a wide plethora of incredible powers. According to Tony Stark, Vision has evolved beyond his anatomy and developed an understanding of emotions which enabled him to deactivate his transponder and maintain a discreet relationship with Wanda Maximoff. Superhuman Strength: Vision destroying an Ultron Sentry As a synthezoid composed of vibranium, Vision possessed superhuman strength, demonstrated when Vision effortlessly overpowered Hawkeye, took down numerous Ultron Sentries with his bare hands and overpowered Corvus Glaive despite having been stabbed by his weapon in their first fight. He even grappled with Ultron himself while the latter was in his most powerful vibranium form, while sending him flying with a single blow of Mjlnir, and even made the gigantic Ant-Man stumble with a mighty blow. Superhuman Durability: The vibranium composition of Vision's body allowed him to withstand attacks of immense force with no visible damage to his exterior. His resilience was further reinforced with aid from the Mind Stone, which allowed him to vastly increase his density. However, Vision's durability was not enough to withstand a stab from Corvus Glaive's glaive. It also was not enough to prevent Thanos from easily ripping the Mind Stone out of his head, killing him. Superhuman Speed: Vision could move or run at super sonic speeds. This was shown when he was able to catch up to multiple Ultron Sentries during the Battle of Sokovia. During the same battle, he also flew through debris of the city when it was falling to the ground at an immeasurable speed. He was able to catch up to the falling city. Superhuman Agility: Vision could easily move around, whether it is while flying or while grounded. He could easily maneuver through the air while defeating many Ultron Sentries. He was even able to dodge countless amounts of debris to save Wanda Maximoff while Novi Grad, the capital city of Sokovia, was falling to the ground. Superhuman Stamina: As a Synthezoid, Vision did not sleep nor eat, being highly capable of maintaining his activities continuously for unlimited periods of time. He also lacked internal organs that tire out a normal human. Superhuman Reflexes: Vision had superhuman reaction time. He flew through and dodged falling debris as Sokovia came crashing down. He also could effortlessly decrease his density in time to avoid being hit by Hawkeye's arrows and baton. Longevity: As a synthezoid, Vision was able to biologically live forever unless killed by an exterior cause. Flight: Vision was capable of high speed flight. He could control his own motion-based force to move through the air at great speeds and instantly stop moving while in the air by completely freezing his motion. Levitation: In addition to flight, Vision is able to levitate off the ground without actually flying. Body Manipulation: Vision was able to manipulate his body at will in order to give him an upper hand in the fight. This power is caused by both the Mind Stone and being a Synthezoid. His costumes and appearance can change at will.[13] He created armor and a cape shortly after his birth in the Avengers Tower, but overtime, Vision's powers have evolved to the point that he is now able to completely change his appearance and make himself look like a normal human. However, his power to do so was shut down upon being stabbed through the chest by Corvus Glaive's Glaive. Density Manipulation: A power attributed to the Mind Stone, Vision could increase or decrease his own density and weight at will, allowing him to increase the durability of his physical form or make himself completely weightless. By increasing his density, Vision was able to make Hawkeye's baton break against his skin and was able to stop a bus from hitting Black Panther. Intangibility: Vision phasing through an Ultron Sentry Vision's control over his density, weight and mass give him the ability to phase through solid objects. As he does so, an aura of greenish-yellow light envelopes the part of his body that is phased through matter. When phasing, Vision could increase his density to destroy the object he phases through from the inside. With this ability, Vision could walk through walls, fly right through the gigantic Ant-Man, rip apart numerous Ultron Sentries, and even phase his fingers through Ultron's Vibranium outer shell. However, Corvus Glaive's Glaive was capable of negating Vision's phasing powers after being stabbed by it and Wanda Maximoff used her powers to control the Mind Stone, allowing her to manipulate Vision's density against his will. Energy Blast: Vision fires an energy blast from his head Vision was capable of drawing raw power from the Mind Stone to fire beams of intense cosmic energy from his forehead. This beam was incredibly powerful, enough to slice down an airport tower in a matter of seconds, and even damage Ultron's most powerful Vibranium body, albeit with some help from Iron Man and Thor. His beam was able to easily destroy War Machine's armor. The beam could also reflect from objects that allow it to shoot from any direction, such as firing at Corvus Glaive's Glaive and once deflected, the beam was powerful enough to obliterate a truck. Computer Interaction: As an advanced synthezoid, Vision was able to amplify control of computer and electronics by using his gauntlets.[13] During the Battle of Sokovia, Vision used the Mind Stone to hack into Ultron's programming through physical contact and disable the latter's ability to access the Internet. However, the great effort involved in this task temporarily exhausted Vision, incapacitating him for a short time. Abilities[] \"Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the stone. All of them mixed together, all of them learning from one another.\" Bruce Banner[src] Genius-Level Intellect: Being an artificial intelligence, Vision learned inhumanly quickly and could download data directly to his mind. He formulated an equation based on the events that happened over the years that led to the Sokovia Accords, concluding that the Accords were the necessary path to both aid people and dissuade their growing fears regarding the Avengers. He was also able to determine a method to destroy the Mind Stone via Wanda Maximoff. Master Combatant: Vision fending off of Hawkeye's attack Vision displayed himself to be a highly trained close-quarters fighter, displaying combat skills that were made much more efficient using his density-manipulating powers granted to him by the Mind Stone and superhuman physical attributes. Vision was thus able to easily overpower Hawkeye, a master martial artist on par with Black Widow, despite the fact that Hawkeye had a staff while Vision was unarmed, getting him into a headlock and it was only because Wanda Maximoff used her superior psionic powers to manipulate the Mind Stone that he was defeated. Vision was also capable of standing his ground against Corvus Glaive, a highly trained soldier of Thanos, despite being severely wounded by the latter's weapon during both encounters, even briefly gaining the upper hand until he was hit by a deflected energy blast, and still holding his own despite being weakened further before he was overpowered. Equipment[] Weapons[] Mjlnir: Vision was able to lift Thor's hammer, which he demonstrated by handing it back to Thor before the Avengers departed for Sokovia, much to the shock of the other Avengers. Vision later used Mjlnir to whack a distracted Ultron away with it, before he returned it to Thor, as they discussed the weight balance in the hammer. Glaive: As Corvus Glaive was disarmed by Captain America, Vision managed to pick up his Glaive and impale its owner from behind, killing him to save Rogers. Former Equipment[] \"I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day, who knows? I may even control it.\" Vision[src] Mind Stone: Vision carries the Mind Stone It is an Infinity Stone which was revealed to be inside Loki's Scepter by Ultron when he broke the protective casing of the Scepter's gem so he could use the stone's power to bring life to Vision during an attempt to create a more powerful and evolved body for himself. Thor later entrusted the stone to Vision. However, after numerous attempts by the Black Order, the stone was ripped out of his forehead by Thanos, killing him in the process. Vehicles[] Quinjet: In 2015, Vision boarded the Quinjet when he and the other Avengers journeyed to Sokovia to rescue Natasha Romanoff and to prevent Ultron from destroying the Earth. He boarded the Quinjet again in 2018 as a means to return to the Avengers Compound following the Black Order's attack on him in Edinburgh and when the Avengers decided to take him to Wakanda to extract the Mind Stone from him so that Thanos would not be able to complete his goal of killing half of all life in the universe. Facilities[] Avengers Tower: Following the Battle of Seoul, the Avengers managed to retrieve the Regeneration Cradle with the android body created by Helen Cho. Examining the Cradle at the Avengers Tower, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decided to design the new A.I. in the body, using the logical matrix of J.A.R.V.I.S. As Captain America, Quicksilver, and Wanda Maximoff attempted to stop them, Thor provided the Cradle electrical power in order to awaken Vision. Newly-created Vision joined the Avengers in order to defeat Ultron. \"After the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. Where's he between? He's next to Vision?\"\"Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.\" Tony Stark and Happy Hogan[src] Avengers Compound: Vision in his bedroom in the Avengers Compound In 2015, Vision joined the Avengers in the Compound and took up residence there. In 2016, Vision was tasked by Tony Stark to watch over Wanda Maximoff, upon the ratification of the Sokovia Accords. However, Vision was attacked by Clint Barton and then defeated by Maximoff before they escaped from the Compound. Vision remained living in the Compound for the next two years. In 2018, after having been wounded, he was brought to the Compound and met with the fugitive Avengers. Wakanda Medical Center: Vision was brought to the Center in Wakanda and was aided by Shuri, who set him on a medical exam table. Vision laid down as members of the Avengers spoke with her. Once they left, Shuri began to work on removing the Mind Stone. However, the Center was infiltrated by Corvus Glaive who attacked Shuri, forcing Vision to fight him and push him through the glass window out falling out of the Center. S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters: After his death, Vision's body was brought to S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters where Tyler Hayward ordered experiments on his body as part of Project Cataract with the intention of reactivating him.

(voice) In an indefinite temporality: Deadpool & Wolverine (footage) Trivia[] In the comics, Vision is a synthezoid created by Ultron to be used as an instrument of revenge against his adversaries, though Vision rebelled against his creator and joined the Avengers. He was believed to have been created using the remains of the original Human Torch, though it was ultimately revealed to be a duplicate. He later married Wanda Maximoff and had two sons named Tommy and Billy Maximoff, who were ultimately erased from existence before being reincarnated as Tommy Shepherd and Billy Kaplan. Vision also gave himself the name Victor Shade, when he felt depressed that he did not have a human name. Vision has Vincent Van Gogh's The Mulberry Tree in his room at the Avengers Compound.[14] Following the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport, Vision is seen with a chessboard. He is holding a rook, the only chess piece to not be a person, similar to how he is not an actual person. Vision being reactivated in a pure white body seen in the mid-credits scene of WandaVision episode Previously On is in reference to the comics, where Vision had a white form upon being resurrected. Behind the Scenes[] Some of Spider-Man: Homecoming concept arts featured Vision and War Machine taking part at the Rescue of MV Spirit of America alongside Iron Man, a concept that did not make it to the final version of the movie. Jan Petrina, Richard Cetrone, Josh Wood, Adam Lytle and Eric Mbanda were stunt doubles for Paul Bettany in the role of Vision. John Zimmerman was a stand-in for Paul Bettany in the role of Vision. Anthony Russo described Vision's role in Avengers: Infinity War as \"a living MacGuffin. Obviously, that raises the stakes because Vision's life is in danger, and his life is in conflict with Thanos' goals, so something's got to give.\"[15] Paul Bettany revealed in an interview while promoting WandaVision that Joss Whedon originally intended for Vision to have a penis, despite misgivings from Kevin Feige and Louis D'Esposito. Upon seeing the concept art, Whedon concluded that it was a bad idea.[16] References[] The Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki has a collection of images and media related to Vision.
