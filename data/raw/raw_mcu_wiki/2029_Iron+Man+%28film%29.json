Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a \nhigh-tech suit of armor\n and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his \npowerful armor\n and vows to protect the world as Iron Man.\n[\n5\n]\nPlot\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n blows off his award\n \n \nPlayboy and visionary industrial genius \nTony Stark\n, CEO of leading military defense contractor, \nStark Industries\n, is at a casino, blowing off an award ahead of a big day in war-torn \nKunar\n, \nAfghanistan\n, to demonstrate his company's new \nJericho\n missile. With him is his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel \nJames Rhodes\n, a member of the \nUnited States Air Force\n, they arrive.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n presenting the new \nJericho\n missile\n \n \nWhile riding in a transport convoy, Stark is critically wounded in an ambush and held captive in a cave by the \nTen Rings\n. An electromagnet built by fellow captive \nHo Yinsen\n keeps the shrapnel that wounded Stark from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings leader, \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n, offers Stark freedom; in exchange, Stark must build a Jericho missile for the terrorists. Stark and Yinsen agree that al-Wazar will not keep his word of letting Stark live.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n is fitted with the \nMark I\n \n \nWhile pretending to work on the missile, Stark and Yinsen secretly build a powerful electric generator called an \nArc Reactor\n to power Stark's electromagnet. They then begin to build a \npowered suit of armor\n, designed by Stark, to help them escape. The Ten Rings ambush the workshop when they discover Stark's plan, but Yinsen sacrifices himself to distract them while Stark's suit powers up. Using the armored suit, Stark fights his way out of the cave to find a mortally wounded Yinsen, who reassures Stark and urges him to continue his escape and not waste his life. An enraged Stark leaves the cave, burns the terrorist's stockpile of Stark Industries-produced weapons, and flies away. Having escaped, Stark crashes in the desert, which destroys the suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nObadiah Stane\n panics to fix \nTony Stark\n's announcement\n \n \nHaving been rescued by a search party, including Rhodes, Stark returns home. He calls a press conference to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons, having seen first-hand the strife that they cause in the wrong hands. \nObadiah Stane\n, his father's old partner and the company's manager, informs Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n dances with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nIn his home workshop, Stark spends the following weeks building an \nimproved version\n of his suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. At Stark's first public appearance after his return, \nChristine Everhart\n informs him that Stark Industries weapons, including the Jericho missile, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack \nGulmira\n, Yinsen's home village. Stark confronts Stane about the supplied weapons and learns that Stane is trying to replace him as head of the company.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man\n flies in the \nIron Man Armor: Mark III\n \n \nEnraged, Stark dons his \nnew armor\n and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the citizens of Gulmira from the Ten Rings' wrath. While flying home, Stark is engaged by two \nF-22 Raptors\n on behalf of the U.S. Air Force. He phones Rhodes and reveals his identity in an attempt to call off the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit. Al-Wazar meets with Stane and offers to exchange the suit with him. However, Stane has al-Wazar and his faction eliminated, taking the suit for himself. Returning to Stark Industries, Stane orders his scientists to have a new suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage.\n \n \n \n \n \nPepper Potts\n speaks to \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nSeeking to find any other weapons delivered to the Ten Rings, Stark sends his trusted personal assistant, \nPepper Potts\n, to hack into the company computer system from Stane's office. Potts finds evidence of Stane supplying weapons to the terrorists, but also discovers that Stane had initially hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark in Afghanistan. After an uncomfortable encounter with a suspicious Stane, Potts meets with \nPhil Coulson\n of the \nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division\n to inform him of Stane's activities.\n \n \n \n \n \nObadiah Stane\n finishes the armor\n \n \nStane's scientists reveal that they cannot finish his suit, as no one can manage to duplicate Stark's Arc Reactor. Stane ambushes Stark at his home, using a \nSonic Taser\n to paralyze him and take his current Arc Reactor. Left to die, Stark manages to crawl to his lab and saves himself by re-using his original arc reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons \nhis suit\n and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his upgraded reactor to run his suit at full capacity.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony Stark\n ahead of his press conference\n \n \nStark lures Stane atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large Arc Reactor there. Doing so unleashes a massive electrical surge that knocks Stane unconscious, causing him and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, the press has dubbed the armored hero \"Iron Man\". Agent Coulson gives Stark a cover story to explain the events of the night and Stane's death. At a press conference, Stark begins giving the cover story, but then instead announces that he is Iron Man, shocking the public as the crowd of interviewers suddenly begin roaring out questions, much to Rhodes' confusion.\n \n \n \n \n \nNick Fury\n introduces himself to \nTony Stark\n \n \nAfterward\n, \nNick Fury\n visits Stark at his home, stating that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world,\" and wants to discuss the \nAvengers Initiative\n.\nCast\n[\n]\nRobert Downey Jr.\n as \nTony Stark/Iron Man\nTerrence Howard\n as Lieutenant Colonel \nJames Rhodes\nJeff Bridges\n as \nObadiah Stane/Iron Monger\nGwyneth Paltrow\n as \nPepper Potts\nLeslie Bibb\n as \nChristine Everhart\nShaun Toub\n as Doctor \nHo Yinsen\nFaran Tahir\n as \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\nClark Gregg\n as Agent \nPhil Coulson\nBill Smitrovich\n as General \nWilliam Gabriel\nSayed Badreya\n as \nAbu Bakaar\nPaul Bettany\n as \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n \n(voice)\nJon Favreau\n as \nHappy Hogan\nPeter Billingsley\n as \nWilliam Ginter Riva\nTim Guinee\n as Major \nJulius Allen\nKevin Foster\n as \nJimmy Ryan\nGarrett Noel\n as \nAdam Pratt\nEileen Weisinger\n as \nRamirez\nAhmed Ahmed\n as \nAhmed\nFahim Fazli\n as \nOmar\nGerard Sanders\n as \nHoward Stark\nRussell Richardson\n as \nScott Campbell\nTim Rigby\n as \nWhiplash 1\nNazanin Boniadi\n as \nAmira Ahmed\nThomas Craig Plumer\n as Colonel \nCraig\nMicah A.
