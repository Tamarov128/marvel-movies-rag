Feel empty. And I think he was right. Which is how I've been feeling for a long time. I push people away, kept them at a distance because of the fear of that loss, but I don't wanna do that anymore.\"\nThor to \nMighty Thor\n[src]\nThor Odinson\n is the \nAsgardian\n God of Thunder, the former king of both \nAsgard\n and \nNew Asgard\n, a founding member of the \nAvengers\n, and a former member of the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an \nancient war\n between Asgard and \nJotunheim\n, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer \nMjlnir\n and he was banished to \nEarth\n by \nOdin\n. While exiled on Earth, Thor found love with \nJane Foster\n, and learned humility by saving his new friends from the \nDestroyer\n sent by \nLoki\n. Due to his selfless \nact of sacrifice\n, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to \ndefeat\n Loki's schemes of genocide.\nUpon being welcomed back to \nAsgard\n as a hero, Thor was forced to return to \nEarth\n in order to retrieve Loki after he had begun his \nattempt at world domination\n with the \nTesseract\n. Thor joined the \nAvengers\n under the guidance of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and stood with them to stop Loki's schemes, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki's \nChitauri\n army during the \nBattle of New York\n. After Loki's defeat, Thor captured and returned him to Asgard to await justice for his crimes.\nThor helped the \nAsgardian armies\n restore peace across all of the \nNine Realms\n during the \nWar of the Nine Realms\n. However, the peace was disrupted by \nMalekith\n and the \nDark Elves\n, who wanted to use the \nAether\n to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. When Foster absorbed the Aether, Thor rallied to protect her on Asgard, leading to an \nattack\n by Malekith which resulted in \nFrigga\n's death. When the Aether was eventually removed from Foster, Thor helped defeat Malekith and his forces before they could unleash the Aether during the \nConvergence\n. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster. During their time together, Thor enchanted Mjlnir to protect Foster.\nDuring his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers to locate Loki's \nScepter\n during the \nfight\n against \nHYDRA\n. Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of \nBaron Strucker\n, the team had to \nstop\n the newly created \nUltron\n, a rogue A.I. created by \nTony Stark\n which conspired to bring about human extinction. Once Ultron had been defeated, Thor went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by \nWanda Maximoff\n of the \nInfinity Stones\n. In his investigations, Thor also discovered that Loki was still alive and had usurped Odin's royal throne during Thor's absence.\nTo aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought help from \nDoctor Strange\n, who led him to Odin moments before his passing to \nValhalla\n. Shortly afterwards, Thor met \nHela\n, the Goddess of Death and his half-sister. In the wake of his first encounter with Hela, Mjlnir was destroyed, and he was stranded in \nSakaar\n, where he was forced to compete in the \nContest of Champions\n. After a reunion and subsequent \nfight\n with \nHulk\n, the pair allied with the rogue \nValkyrie\n in order to save Asgard and \nescape\n Sakaar. After \nbattling\n with Hela and losing an eye to her, Thor then had Loki unleash \nRagnark\n and \ndestroy\n \nAsgard\n, killing Hela in the process, although he escaped with the remaining \nAsgardians\n. Declaring that Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound position as king and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth.\nAs they were en route to Earth, \ntheir ship\n was \nattacked\n by \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n, who took the \nTesseract\n and murdered his brother, before leaving Thor for dead. He was rescued by the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n and teamed up with \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n to travel to \nNidavellir\n. With the help of \nEitri\n, Thor crafted \nStormbreaker\n and aided the nation of \nWakanda\n and the Avengers in confronting Thanos and his forces. However, Thor squandered his chance to kill Thanos with his new weapon and Thanos activated the completed \nInfinity Gauntlet\n and \nerased\n half the universe's population from existence. After the Avengers were joined by \nCaptain Marvel\n, the team traveled to the \nGarden\n, where Thor and the Avengers \nambushed\n Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor beheaded Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet.\nFollowing Thanos' death, Thor left the Avengers and relocated to \nTnsberg\n, \nNorway\n, where he and the surviving Asgardians resettled, establishing \nNew Asgard\n. \nFive years later\n, Hulk and Rocket convinced the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin the team after discovering how to \ntravel through time\n. Thor joined the Avengers on their \nTime Heist\n and the ensuing \nbattle\n against an \nalternate Thanos\n alongside \nCaptain America\n and \nIron Man\n, ending in Stark sacrificing his life to destroy Thanos' forces. After attending Stark's funeral, Thor decided to join the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, proclaiming Valkyrie to succeed him as king of the Asgardians.\nFor the next two years, Thor journeyed with the Guardians, but his time with them was brought to an end in \n2025\n due to \nGorr\n's \nvow\n against the gods. During a \nbattle\n against Gorr, Thor would be joined by his former flame, \nJane Foster\n, who to Thor's surprise now wielded \nMjlnir\n. Thor, joined by \nKorg\n, Valkyrie and Foster went on a mission to warn the other gods and get an army to fight Gorr, Thor and his team traveled to \nOmnipotence City\n to warn \nZeus\n. The disagreement of the \nOlympians\n led to confrontation, in which then Thor heavily injured Zeus. Eventually, Thor alongside Foster managed to \ndefeat\n Gorr but at the cost of her life. After Gorr died, Thor adopted his \ndaughter\n and trained her, with the duo becoming known as Love and \nThunder\n, who set off upon adventures as protectors of other aliens across the universe.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nRiding into Battle\n1.1.2\n \nYouth with Loki\n1.1.3\n \nRaised to be King\n1.1.4\n \nLoki's Mischief\n1.1.5\n \nBecoming Nordic Legend\n1.1.6\n \nVirtue Challenge\n1.1.7\n \nWarrior\n1.1.8\n \nWinning a Bet\n1.2\n \nLoki's Schemes\n1.2.1\n \nDelayed Coronation\n1.2.2\n \nRecruiting the Warriors Three\n1.2.3\n \nAttack on Jotunheim\n1.2.4\n \nBanished to Earth\n1.2.5\n \nTreated in Hospital\n1.2.6\n \nMisunderstandings\n1.2.7\n \nUnworthy of Power\n1.3\n \nLearning Humility\n1.3.1\n \nCaptured by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n1.3.2\n \nBonding with Jane Foster\n1.3.3\n \nReunion with Warriors\n1.3.4\n \nBattle of Puente Antiguo\n1.3.5\n \nReturn to Strength\n1.3.6\n \nFighting Loki\n1.3.7\n \nReflecting on the Future\n1.4\n \nChitauri Invasion\n1.4.1\n \nReturning to Earth\n1.4.2\n \nConfronted by Iron Man\n1.4.3\n \nWorking with S.H.I.E.L.D.\n1.4.4\n \nAvengers Argument\n1.4.5\n \nAttack on the Helicarrier\n1.4.6\n \nConfronting Loki\n1.4.7\n \nBattle of New York\n1.4.8\n \nClosing the Portal\n1.4.9\n \nReturning to Asgard\n1.5\n \nWar of the Nine Realms\n1.5.1\n \nSearch for the Crown of Fools\n1.5.2\n \nBattle of Vanaheim\n1.5.3\n \nCelebration\n1.6\n \nSecond Dark Elf Conflict\n1.6.1\n \nProtecting Jane Foster\n1.6.2\n \nSacking of Asgard\n1.6.3\n \nRecruiting His Allies\n1.6.4\n \nFreeing Loki\n1.6.5\n \nEscape from Asgard\n1.6.6\n \nFighting Malekith\n1.6.7\n \nReturn to Earth\n1.6.8\n \nBattle of Greenwich\n1.6.9\n \nDestroying Malekith\n1.6.10\n \nRejecting the Throne\n1.7\n \nAvengers Reassembled\n1.7.1\n \nDeeply in Love\n1.7.2\n \nBattle of Sudan\n1.7.3\n \nAttack on the HYDRA Research Base\n1.7.4\n \nAvengers Celebration\n1.8\n \nUltron Offensive\n1.8.1\n \nAttack on Avengers Tower\n1.8.2\n \nArgument\n1.8.3\n \nBattle at the Salvage Yard\n1.8.4\n \nWater of Sight\n1.8.5\n \nBirth of Vision\n1.9\n \nBattle of Sokovia\n1.9.1\n \nBattling the Ultron Sentries\n1.9.2\n \nProtecting the Key\n1.9.3\n \nDestroying the City\n1.10\n \nSearch for Answers\n1.10.1\n \nFarewell to the Avengers\n1.10.2\n \nBreakup with Jane Foster\n1.10.3\n \nFutile Search\n1.10.4\n \nExposing Loki\n1.10.5\n \nMeeting Doctor Strange\n1.10.6\n \nOdin's Farewell\n1.11\n \nReturn of Hela\n1.11.1\n \nFamily Reunion\n1.11.2\n \nStranded on Sakaar\n1.11.3\n \nMeeting Grandmaster\n1.11.4\n \nContest of Champions\n1.11.5\n \nFight Preparation\n1.11.6\n \nDuel with Hulk\n1.11.7\n \nTrapped on Sakaar\n1.11.8\n \nCommunicating with Heimdall\n1.11.9\n \nCatching Up with Hulk\n1.11.10\n \nTricking Valkyrie\n1.12\n \nSaving Asgard\n1.12.1\n \nEscaping Grandmaster\n1.12.2\n \nHelping Bruce Banner\n1.12.3\n \nForming the Revengers\n1.12.4\n \nFarewell to Loki\n1.12.5\n \nEscape from Sakaar\n1.12.6\n \nDuel in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf\n1.12.7\n \nBattle for Asgard\n1.12.8\n \nDestruction of Asgard\n1.13\n \nInfinity War\n1.13.1\n \nHeading Towards Earth\n1.13.2\n \nAttack on the \nStatesman\n1.13.3\n \nRescued in Space\n1.13.4\n \nTraveling to Nidavellir\n1.13.5\n \nForging the Axe\n1.13.6\n \nBattle of Wakanda\n1.13.7\n \nArrival of the Titan\n1.13.8\n \nThanos' Victory\n1.14\n \nLife of Guilt\n1.14.1\n \nArrival of Captain Marvel\n1.14.2\n \nAmbush on Thanos\n1.14.3\n \nNew Asgard\n1.14.4\n \nReturning to the Avengers\n1.15\n \nTime Heist\n1.15.1\n \nDiscussing the Aether\n1.15.2\n \nTheft of the Reality Stone\n1.15.3\n \nNatasha Romanoff's Death\n1.15.4\n \nThe Blip\n1.15.5\n \nBattling Another Thanos\n1.15.6\n \nBattle of Earth\n1.16\n \nWithout a Path\n1.16.1\n \nNew King of Asgard\n1.16.2\n \nJoining the Guardians\n1.16.3\n \nGetting Back in Shape\n1.16.4\n \nAdventures with the Guardians\n1.16.5\n \nBattle of Indigarr\n1.17\n \nConflict with Gorr\n1.17.1\n \nLearning about the God Butcher\n1.17.2\n \nProtecting New Asgard\n1.17.3\n \nHeading to Omnipotence City\n1.17.4\n \nEscape from Omnipotence City\n1.17.5\n \nHeading to the Shadow Realm\n1.17.6\n \nAmbush at the Shadow Realm\n1.17.7\n \nJane Foster's Health\n1.17.8\n \nStopping Gorr's Quest\n1.17.9\n \nChoosing Love\n1.18\n \nA New Purpose\n1.18.1\n \nRaising Love\n1.19\n \nDeadpool's Sacrifice\n2\n \nPersonality\n3\n \nPowers and Abilities\n3.1\n \nPowers\n3.2\n \nAbilities\n4\n \nEquipment\n4.1\n \nAsgardian Armor\n4.2\n \nWeapons\n4.3\n \nOther Equipment\n4.4\n \nFormer Equipment\n4.5\n \nVehicles\n5\n \nFacilities\n6\n \nRelationships\n6.1\n \nFamily\n6.2\n \nAllies\n6.3\n \nEnemies\n7\n \nAppearances\n8\n \nTrivia\n9\n \nBehind the Scenes\n10\n \nReferences\n11\n \nExternal Links\nBiography\n[\n]\nThis is an in-depth biography of Thor. For an abridged overview, see \nMarvel Database's article on the same character\n.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nRiding into Battle\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being taken into battle by his \nmother\n \n \n\"Raised in the way of the \nwarrior\n, Thor was taught to help win battles, fighting the good fight for those who can't fight good.\"\n\nKorg\n[src]\nThor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in \nAsgard\n as the most treasured son of \nOdin\n and his wife \nFrigga\n, but he was falsely led to believe that he was the firstborn child of the Allfather. When Thor was still a baby, he was carried by Frigga, into battle alongside the \nEinherjar\n.\n[\n2\n]\nYouth with Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor grows up in \nAsgard\n \n \n\"Thor and \nLoki\n, a brotherhood so strong and pivotal, it would change the fate of a universe. Their childhood taught Thor many lessons.\"\n\nWatcher\n[src]\nThor grew up in \nAsgard\n, wishing to become a warrior like \nOdin\n and inherit the throne and the title of the King from him. His friend and playmate was his brother \nLoki\n, and though the brothers were both rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions.\n[\n1\n]\n Loki was taught \nmagic\n by their mother, while Thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father.\n[\n9\n]\n During his youth, Thor fostered a strong desire to join the \nValkyries\n until he learned they were an elite group of female-only soldiers.\n[\n5\n]\nRaised to be King\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is given a lesson by his father \nOdin\n \n \n\"When I'm king, I'll hunt the \nmonsters\n down and slay them all, just as you did, father!\"\n\"A wise king never seeks out war, but he must always be ready for it.\"\nThor and \nOdin\n[src]\nBrought up within the warrior culture of the \nAsgardians\n, Thor valued strength, courage, and loyalty above all else. He had desired to be exactly like \nOdin\n, who had defeated \nLaufey\n during the \nAsgard-Jotunheim War\n and brought peace across all the \nNine Realms\n. To help him become a warrior, Thor received the powerful hammer, \nMjlnir\n to be his companion when he became king, helping him to focus his ability to control thunder.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nLoki\n are given advice from \nOdin\n \n \nThor often remarked on the monsters, such as the \nFrost Giants\n, he would slay and the wars he would win once he was king, although Odin attempted to teach him to value peace above war while dealing with all of their enemies. As both Thor and \nLoki\n insisted that they would both be ready to become King of \nAsgard\n, Odin noted that only one of them would be able to take the throne. Over the years, Thor was groomed by Odin to become King, leaving Loki jealous.\n[\n1\n]\n In order to transition into adult hood, Thor, along with other Asgardians, took part in the \nVirtue Challenge\n.\n[\n10\n]\nLoki's Mischief\n[\n]\n\"Loki! You'll pay for this.\"\n\"Ah, damn.\"\n\"You turned me into a frog!\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nAs Thor and \nLoki\n grew up together, Loki developed a taste for mischief and \nmagic\n, as he had been taught by \nFrigga\n. Thor was once tricked by his brother when Loki transformed himself into a snake, knowing that Thor loved snakes. Upon picking up the snake, Thor was surprised as Loki turned back to himself and stabbed his brother, although Thor survived.\n[\n5\n]\n In another instance, Loki turned Thor into a frog for a brief time.\n[\n5\n]\n With Thor gone, Loki sat on the throne of \nAsgard\n and pretended to take over the crown, but frog Thor soon confronted his brother and pummeled him with \nMjlnir\n.\n[\n11\n]\nBecoming Nordic Legend\n[\n]\n\"This isn't like a journey to \nEarth\n, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the \nmortals\n worship you as a God.\"\n\nFandral\n to Thor\n[src]\nThor and \nLoki\n, along with \nOdin\n, visited \nEarth\n. The \nAsgardians\n taught the \nNorse\n people their language and culture and displayed their abilities; this caused the Norse people to believe the Asgardians to be deities, and bestowed upon Thor the moniker \"God of Thunder.\" They also named a day of the week after him, \"Thor's Day,\" which became Thursday.\n[\n1\n]\n In his childhood, Thor encountered the \nEternal\n known as \nKingo\n and grew to admire him.\n[\n12\n]\nVirtue Challenge\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sets off on the \nVirtue Challenge\n \n \nOne day in \n1521\n, Thor was training, when suddenly \nLoki\n came charging through with \nBrunok\n chasing him. Thor stopped the commotion and listened to Brunok's claim that Loki insulted his family. They all agreed to settle it over a quest of virtue, the \nVirtue Challenge\n. During the challenge, Thor wandered into a place that gave him illusions of people who told him he wasn't good enough. However, he was able to overcome the illusions. He then found the \nBone of the Wolves' Treasureyard\n, meaning he won the first challenge. He suddenly heard Loki hanging by a branch, calling out in an apology. As it turned out, Loki was also overcome by illusions and thought everyone was going to die. Thor snapped him out of it.\n[\n13\n]\nThe three made their way to the \nHawk's Egg\n, which was the second challenge. There, they found the \nWarriors Three\n, who were also doing the challenge. On the branch, Sif fell, but was caught by Thor and Loki. This gave her enough leverage to grab the egg. However, on the ground, \nAsgardian Wolves\n attacked because \nVolstagg\n took a second bone from the forest. Volstagg then threw the bone back, which made the wolves chase after it.\n[\n14\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor wields \nMjlnir\n during a \nVirtue Challenge\n \n \nAt the third challenge in the mine, Loki found the \nCup of Glory\n, sparking an all-out war for the cup between all of them, including \nBrunok\n and his team that had just arrived. Thor took the cup and summoned lightning down onto the group. Volstagg stopped the mine from toppling on top of them. Loki then apologized for setting this up so he could get the Cup. He said he just wanted the respect that Thor got. Thor forgave him and apologized himself, but Volstagg said it was not his fault. Thor then found the entrance to the cave.\n[\n15\n]\nThey soon came across \nHaldier\n, who was worried about his son, Brunok. Haldier saw the Cup and became enthralled by it. Thor came in to stop him, but was pushed off of the cliff. Thor grabbed onto a branch to save himself and used \nMjlnir\n to get back up. He then stopped Haldier and gave him a talk about pride before sending him on his way.\n[\n16\n]\nWarrior\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor faces off against \nImir\n \n \n\"Have you forgotten all that we have done together? \nFandral\n, Hogun, who led you into the most glorious battles?\"\n\"You did.\"\n\"And \nVolstagg\n, to delicacies so succulent you thought you'd died and gone to \nValhalla\n?\"\nThor and \nHogun\n[src]\nThor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his own band of warriors into battle, which included \nSif\n, \nLoki\n, as well as the \nWarriors Three\n on adventures which he would describe as being glorious. However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle.\n[\n1\n]\n Thor had also defeated \nImir\n, a rogue \nAsgardian\n who threatened to take control of \nAsgard\n and taken several of the \nDwarven\n smiths captives.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor alongside the rest of the royal family\n \n \nWhile Imir managed to get the upper hand on Thor, he was eventually defeated when Thor electrocuted him with \nMjlnir\n, giving Thor yet another grand victory to his name which also increasing his already large ego.\n[\n17\n]\n With several great victories to his name, Thor and all the rest of the \nAsgardian Royal Family\n continued to rule over Asgard and all the \nNine Realms\n, ensuring the peace was kept, despite Thor still longing for more battles and wars to satisfy his warrior nature.\n[\n1\n]\nWinning a Bet\n[\n]\nOn \nNovember 24, 1971\n, Thor won a bet against \nLoki\n, which involved the latter acquiring $200,000 from \nEarth\n after \nhijacking\n Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 with a bomb threat under the pseudonym \nD.B. Cooper\n.\n[\n18\n]\nLoki's Schemes\n[\n]\nDelayed Coronation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks to \nLoki\n before the ceremony\n \n \n\"Do you swear to cast aside your selfish ambition and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms?\"\n\"I swear!\"\n\"And on this day, I, Odin All-Father, will proclaim you...\"\n\nOdin\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor was eventually announced to be the next ruler of \nAsgard\n by \nOdin\n, as he was about to finally enter the \nOdinsleep\n after putting it off for so long. While preparing for the ceremony, Thor spoke with \nLoki\n as they joked about if Thor was nervous or not, which he insisted he was not before Loki mocked his \nWinged Helmet\n. Loki, however, assured Thor that he was still proud of his brother.\n[\n19\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor enjoys the cheers at his coronation\n \n \nThor appeared at the ceremony, walking throughout the crowds of cheering \nAsgardians\n and enjoying every moment of the event. Upon arriving before the throne, Thor removed his helmet and nodded to his friends, \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n while winking towards \nFrigga\n and Loki. Odin then stood up and ordered silence in the great hall by hitting \nGungnir\n on the ground as Thor underwent the passage of finally becoming king of Asgard from Odin.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to become king of \nAsgard\n \n \nOdin gave a speech in which he acknowledged Thor to be his firstborn, noting how he was entrusted with the mighty \nMjlnir\n which would be his companion as the king. Odin then had Thor swear to set aside all selfish ambition to protect all the \nNine Realms\n as well as Asgard, which Thor swore to. As Odin was about to name Thor king, he sensed that the \nFrost Giants\n had sneaked into Asgard and into \nhis vault\n to steal the \nCasket of Ancient Winters\n from them.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor argues with \nOdin\n over going to war\n \n \nOdin, Thor and Loki went to the vault to find the Frost Giants had already been slain by the \nDestroyer\n. Seeing how close they had come to steal the artifacts, the enraged Thor declared that they must go to \nJotunheim\n and show their strength, but Odin refused to go to war with \nLaufey\n again. Thor insisted that as king of Asgard, he would lead their army as Odin had done before him. Odin reminded him that he was not king yet and ordered him not to attack.\n[\n1\n]\nRecruiting the Warriors Three\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor vents his anger by overthrowing tables\n \n \n\"We're going to \nJotunheim\n.\"\nThor\n[src]\nHaving rejected from taking his own place as \nAsgard\n's newest king due to the attacks of the \nFrost Giants\n, Thor was completely enraged, believing that his day of triumph had been ruined. Within their dining hall, the utterly furious Thor began throwing tables around in anger, venting his rage on the food prepared for the celebrations for him being crowned king.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is offered some poor advice from \nLoki\n \n \nWhile Thor went to sit alone and consider the injustice that had been put upon him, \nLoki\n joined him and comforted him over not becoming the King of \nAsgard\n as he had hoped before convincing him then that he was right in his idea and they had to go to \nJotunheim\n to confront King \nLaufey\n for the crimes his people had committed against them, despite denying any of this was indeed his own plan, noting it would require them having to defy \nOdin\n's direct commands.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor recruiting \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n \n \nAs they were talking, \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n arrived, with \nVolstagg\n being horrified at finding the now overturned dinner table. Thor announced they were going to Jotunheim and that he would lead them to victory. The group was fearful of the idea, noting that the \nFrost Giants\n were not easy foes to overcome. Although they were initially skeptical over the risks, Thor reminded them of their past victories and soon changed their minds about the attack.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to use the \nBifrost Bridge\n \n \nThe group traveled towards the \nBifrost Bridge\n and sought \nHeimdall\n's permission for passage to Jotunheim. Ignoring Loki's attempts to talk his way past him, Heimdall did still grant Thor's request, noting that throughout all his years as guardian this was the first time an enemy had gotten past his watch. Heimdall then sent them to Jotunheim, but warned that if they all got into trouble, they would not be granted entrance back home and would all be left to die there.\n[\n1\n]\nAttack on Jotunheim\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nLoki\n speak with \nLaufey\n \n \n\"Your \nfather\n is a murderer and a thief! Why have you come \nhere\n? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. You're nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.\"\n\"This 'boy' has grown tired of your mockery.\"\n\nLaufey\n and Thor\n[src]\nOnce they arrived at \nJotunheim\n, Thor led the \nWarriors Three\n through the destroyed realm toward \nLaufey\n's chambers where he warned them to leave while he still allowed them to, although Thor continued to demand to know how his people had gotten into \nOdin's Vault\n to steal the \nCasket of Ancient Winters\n. One of the \nFrost Giants\n approached Thor before Loki led him away, noting that they were outnumbered by their enemies and it would be unwise to begin a conflict, much to Thor's great annoyance. Thor remained silent as he walked away from Laufey until a Frost Giant called Thor a princess.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles the \nFrost Giants\n in \nJotunheim\n \n \nThor unleashed his anger and with the mighty power of \nMjlnir\n hit the Frost Giant so hard he flew across the wasteland. Having begun the skirmish, the warriors then bravely joined Thor and battled the Frost Giants. Thor took great pleasure in fighting all his enemies, throwing Mjlnir at \nHailstrum\n and others while demanding more of a challenge. While Thor was enjoying himself, \nFandral\n was struck by a Frost Giant and warned Thor to pull back while they had some chance.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor unleashes all of \nMjlnir\n's power\n \n \nThor told them to leave while he battled the Frost Giants alone. As his friends left and reached the \nBifrost Bridge\n, Thor unleashed the full power of Mjlnir and erupted the ground around him killing hundreds of the Frost Giants, before flying at full speed to kill the \nFrost Beast\n that was chasing the \nAsgardians\n. Laufey and his whole army then surrounded Thor and his friends, who were driven back to the edge of a cliff, seemingly defenseless against the army.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and his allies are rescued by \nOdin\n \n \nBefore they attacked, \nOdin\n then arrived while riding \nSleipnir\n. Thor attempted to convince his father to join him in the battle only to be told to remain silent. Odin then warned King Laufey by telling him to preserve the peace and not respond to the actions of a boy. Laufey said that war had now already begun between them, and Odin then transported himself and the other Asgardians back home, furious at Thor for his actions and the consequences.\n[\n1\n]\nBanished to Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor arguing with \nOdin\n \n \n\"That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership. You've forgotten everything I taught you about a warrior's patience.\"\n\"While you wait and be patient, the \nNine Realms\n laugh at us! The old ways are done! You'd stand giving speeches while \nAsgard\n falls!\"\n\nOdin\n and Thor\n[src]\nBack in the \nBifrost Bridge\n, \nOdin\n ordered the \nWarriors Three\n to take the seriously wounded \nFandral\n to the Healing Room. Odin then chastised Thor for his reckless actions saying that he would sacrifice the lives of innocent people to go to war against the \nFrost Giants\n and that they were not the actions of a King, but a warrior. Thor told Odin he was an old man and a fool, arguing that the \nNine Realms\n were in danger as Odin was still afraid to act against their enemies, with Thor making it clear that he wanted \nLaufey\n to fear him as much as he had once feared Odin.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is banished without any of his powers\n \n \nAcknowledging that Thor had proven himself to be unworthy to be king, Odin confessed that he was a fool to have ever thought Thor was ready to rule Asgard, ignoring \nLoki\n when he tried to protest to protect his brother. While Thor stood horrified, Odin then took \nMjlnir\n from Thor and removed his powers before using the Bifrost to banish Thor to \nEarth\n without his strength, as a punishment for being proven unworthy by betraying Asgard and his loved one by his actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finds himself trapped on \nMidgard\n \n \nThor was then sent through the \nBifrost Bridge\n arriving onto Earth in a \nwormhole\n, which was being studied by \nJane Foster\n, \nErik Selvig\n and \nDarcy Lewis\n. Thor stood only to be knocked over by the truck they were driving, much to the horror of the scientists who immediately ran to his aid. Thor quickly awoke and began shouting to \nHeimdall\n to reopen the Bifrost and return him and then demanded to know which of all of the \nNine Realms\n he was currently in, questioning if it was either \nAlfheim\n or \nNornheim\n to which Lewis explained that this was \nNew Mexico\n, much to Thor's confusion as he continued calling to Mjlnir and Heimdall to take him home.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is threatened by \nDarcy Lewis\n' taser\n \n \nThe humans had soon come to believe Thor to be crazy and as Lewis had threatened Thor with a taser, he was utterly disgusted at her actions, claiming it to be an insult for an \nAsgardian\n warrior like himself to be threatened by such a puny weapon. However, Thor was unaware of his new weaknesses as Lewis then tasered him knocking him unconscious. Thor was then put inside of Selvig's van and driven into \nPuente Antiguo\n to receive medical attention.\n[\n1\n]\nTreated in Hospital\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor reacts to doctors taking his blood\n \n \n\"How dare you attack the son of \nOdin\n!\"\nThor\n[src]\nThor awoke in \nPuente Antiguo County Hospital\n with a man over him saying he that was about to take some blood. Unaware of his surroundings and having seemingly forgotten that he no longer had his \nAsgardian\n strength, Thor attacked the hospital staff and security guards, furious that they had dared to attack him by attempting to take his blood. Taking on dozens of the staff members, Thor yelled that they were no match for the son of \nOdin\n before being sedated by the hospital staff.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finds himself tied onto a hospital bed\n \n \nEventually, Thor awoke yet again to find himself strapped down to a bed. He attempted to rip the restraints off, but to his horror, he found that he was unable to remove all of the ties that had been made by mere \nhumans\n. Determined to get away, Thor eventually managed to squeeze his own hands out of their restraints and headed towards the nearest exit, avoiding the hospital staff members who were still recovering from his earlier outburst of rage and violence.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is hit by \nJane Foster\n's car once again\n \n \nHaving gotten out of the hospital, Thor then began to make his way outside to begin searching for \nMjlnir\n and a way home to \nAsgard\n before being hit again by a car, again driven by \nJane Foster\n, who apologized for running him over for a second time and promised that it was not something she was doing on purpose. To try and make it up to Thor, the scientists then took him back to their own \nWormhole\n \nResearch Center\n to discuss all their research on the subject.\n[\n1\n]\nMisunderstandings\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is given new clothes from \nJane Foster\n \n \n\"I need a horse!\"\n\"\nWe\n don't have horses. Just \ndog\n, \ncats\n, birds.\"\n\"Then give me one of those large enough to ride.\"\nThor and \nKyle\n[src]\nThor was taken back to \nJane Foster\n's science base where he was given \nDonald Blake\n's old clothes, noticing the name tag that still remained on the shirt. Still remaining remarkably arrogant in his new surroundings upon \nMidgard\n, Thor then announced to the bemused group of scientists that he was now hungry, and they all then took him to \nIsabela's Diner\n to get him some pancakes and coffee.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor drinks some coffee for the first time\n \n \nTo the amusement of \nDarcy Lewis\n, Thor ate enormous amounts of food astonishing the three before smashing his own cup on the floor, demanding another drink. Foster told him that if he wanted another, he should ask nicely rather than breaking things while Lewis had him pose for a picture for \nFacebook\n. Thor then overheard \nPete\n and \nJake\n talking about a \"satellite\" that had just crashed onto Earth. Thor soon realized it was \nMjlnir\n and requested directions from the pair.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor goes a mission to reclaim \nMjlnir\n \n \nThor then departed the diner with all the scientists closely behind him, questioning where he was going. Thor told them he would reclaim Mjlnir from \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and give them the answers that they sought about the \nBifrost Bridge\n. Although Foster was eager to learn more, \nErik Selvig\n convinced her not to follow as he feared for Thor's mental state. Thor then said goodbye to Foster, Lewis and Selvig, as he began to walk towards Mjlnir's location.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor demands a horse inside a \npet store\n \n \nRealizing as a mortal, the walk was too far, Thor went to the \nPet Palace\n and demanded a horse. \nKyle\n said that they did not have horses, only \ncats\n, \ndogs\n and other house animals, to which Thor asked for one large enough to ride; instead, all he received was a very confused look from the shop worker. Foster then approached him in her car for a ride to the crash site, to which Thor happily accepted without any hesitation.\n[\n1\n]\nUnworthy of Power\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor hints at his past life to \nJane Foster\n \n \n\"Once I retrieve \nMjlnir\n, I will return to you the items \nthey\n stole from you. Deal?\"\n\"No. You think you're gonna just walk in and walk out?\"\n\"No. I'm gonna fly out.\"\nThor and \nJane Foster\n[src]\nThor was told by \nJane Foster\n that \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n had stolen all of her research on the \nBifrost Bridge\n. He promised to tell her everything she wanted to know about the \nwormholes\n when he reclaimed what was his, although Foster only commented that she still thought Thor was a strange character and noted that she really hoped he was not crazy, which greatly amused Thor as they drove.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor swears to get \nJane Foster\n's research\n \n \nThey soon arrived at the crash site to find it covered by a \nmakeshift research facility\n. As they looked over the facility, Thor gave Foster his jacket as he correctly predicted it would begin to rain momentarily while telling her to remain hidden while he collected what was theirs. When Foster questioned how he planned to walk out with their equipment, Thor informed her that he intended to fly out, which did not help Foster's confidence at all as Thor moved forward.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor breaks into the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound\n \n \nThor entered and took down \nJackson\n and \nDelancey\n before being noticed and began making his way towards \nMjlnir\n, which was being studied in the middle of the base by S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. However, \nJasper Sitwell\n eventually raised the alarm when the agents failed to call in. Thor then began taking down guard after guard, even without any of his former Asgardian strength all his fighting skills still outmatched many of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who challenged him.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor takes out multiple \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agents\n \n \nAs Thor approached Mjlnir having defeated almost all the agents, he was confronted by a particularly big guard whom Thor noted was big, but he had fought bigger, thinking of his fights against the \nFrost Giants\n. Thor battled the agent who was ultimately defeated outside as Thor knocked him out as they both fought in the mud. Thor was unaware that the entire time \nClint Barton\n was taking aim and preparing to shoot him with an arrow if ordered.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tries and fails to finally reclaim \nMjlnir\n \n \nFinally, at Mjlnir, Thor rejoiced before gripping his mighty hammer, but could not lift it; using all of his mortal strength, he still could not lift it. Knowing \nOdin\n had taken his powers away from him as a result of the \nAttack on Jotunheim\n, Thor yelled out at the heavens and fell to his knees. Defeated, Thor offered no resistance while \nPhil Coulson\n sent his agents to apprehend him, telling Barton to also stand down. As the guards arrested him, Thor noticed a small Asgardian symbol that appeared on Mjlnir, and became heartbroken at possibly never seeing his home or family again while he was then taken away for questioning under the orders of Agent Coulson.\n[\n1\n]\nLearning Humility\n[\n]\nCaptured by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is questioned by \nPhil Coulson\n \n \n\"Can I come \nhome\n?\"\n\"The truce with \nJotunheim\n is conditional upon your exile.\"\n\"Yes, but couldn't we find a way?\"\n\"\nMother\n has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.\"\n\"No, I am sorry. Thank you for coming here.\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nThor was taken for questioning by \nPhil Coulson\n, who was convinced he was special forces; his remarkable fighting skills had allowed him to defeat all of Coulson's men, to which Coulson questioned if he was trained in \nAfghanistan\n or \nChechnya\n. Thor remained silent throughout the interrogation and refused to answer Coulson's questions; however, the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agent informed him that sooner or later, they would find out what they wanted to know, noting their organization was good at that.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is then visited by \nLoki\n \n \nWhen Coulson had left for a moment, \nLoki\n then arrived in front of him. Thor asked about \nJotunheim\n and demanded to speak to their father; however, Loki informed him that \nOdin\n was apparently dead due to the strain of everything that had happened and that in Thor's absence, Loki had been made King of \nAsgard\n. When Thor asked if he could go home, Loki explained that Thor had to remain on \nEarth\n to maintain peace with King \nLaufey\n and the \nFrost Giants\n who wanted war.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is informed by \nLoki\n that \nOdin\n is dead\n \n \nAlthough Thor tried to argue that perhaps they could find a way, Loki told him that \nFrigga\n had apparently forbidden his return. Although he was utterly heartbroken, Thor agreed to the arrangement and said goodbye to his brother, thanking him for coming to him and informing him of their father's death. Coulson then returned to the room to find Thor saying goodbye to thin air. Thor then remained sat down on the chair and considered his future while still trapped on Earth.\n[\n1\n]\nBonding with Jane Foster\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is rescued by Doctor \nErik Selvig\n \n \n\"Your ancestors called it \nmagic\n, and you call it science. Well, I come from a \nplace\n where they're one and the same thing.\"\nThor to \nJane Foster\n[src]\nWhile Thor was being interrogated, \nJasper Sitwell\n informed \nPhil Coulson\n that Thor had a visitor; \nErik Selvig\n, who had arrived and told the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n that Thor was \nDonald Blake\n, their colleague who was drunk and very upset about the loss of their equipment. Coulson allowed Thor to leave so he could follow them, with Thor stealing a notebook on his way out.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor has a drink with \nErik Selvig\n \n \nDespite being ordered not to, Thor and Selvig then went for a drink together where Thor noted that for the first time in his life he had no idea what his future held, telling Selvig that he now wished he had listened to \nOdin\n's lessons. Selvig told Thor that all he wanted to ensure was that \nJane Foster\n always remained safe, to which Thor insisted he wished her no harm, so Selvig bought him another drink and asked him to leave \nNew Mexico\n in the morning.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor brings \nErik Selvig\n to \nJane Foster\n \n \nHe agreed and they share another drink.\n[\n1\n]\n After a few more drinks, Selvig smashed his glass on the ground and demanded another, as Thor had done with his coffee the day before. Seeing Selvig had begun accepting him, Thor laughed and joined him in demanding more alcohol. All Thor's drinking prowess led to them getting into a bar brawl while walking through the streets singing merry songs until Thor decided Selvig had enjoyed himself enough.\n[\n19\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor spends time with \nJane Foster\n \n \nWith Selvig too drunk to move, Thor brought him to Jane's camper to sleep off the alcohol; though Selvig still didn't believe Thor was the God of Thunder, they both now had a good friendship, as Selvig had then drunkenly claimed that Thor should still be the God of Thunder regardless. Thor and Foster went to the roof of the Research Center and gazed at the stars together. She told Thor about herself, noting how she would often sit on the roof to think or get away from all the annoyances of \nDarcy Lewis\n while he returned her notebook, which he had retaken from S.H.I.E.L.D. for her, much to Foster's delight as she no longer had to restart all of her original work from nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor considers his new life\n \n \nTo reassure Foster about continuing her work, Thor began to tell her all about the \nNine Realms\n and \nYggdrasil\n. Thor also explained that all her theories were correct and then tried to help her understand them better. When she fell asleep, Thor ensured that she was warm before watching over her as she slept before looking up to the stars and considering his past and future now he lived among the humans down on Earth, away from his friends and family.\n[\n1\n]\nReunion with Warriors\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor serves breakfast to all his new friends\n \n \n\"My friends, I have never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.\"\n\"We're here to take you home!\"\n\"You know I can't go home. My \nfather\n is... dead because of me.\"\nThor and \nFandral\n[src]\nThe next day, Thor's attitude had taken a change for the better and he had personally made breakfast for his new friends with \nJane Foster\n.\n[\n1\n]\n During their breakfast together, Thor requested that they allow him to have one of the mugs, which they had accepted. Thor then departed and went straight to \nIsabela's Diner\n where he found \nIsabela Alvarez\n and gave her the mug to replace the one he broke.\n[\n19\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is visited by \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n \n \nThor listened as \nErik Selvig\n and Foster discussed how they planned on presenting their theories to higher-ups without any hard evidence, when they were interrupted by the \nWarriors Three\n and \nSif\n who had arrived on \nEarth\n and were all delighted to see their dear friend again. Amazed, Thor then immediately ran over to his friends and embraced them, while Foster, Selvig and Lewis looked on in utter amazement as their arrival seemingly confirmed that Thor was telling the truth.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns of \nLoki\n's betrayal\n \n \nThor rejoiced to see them all but told them that they should not have come to collect him, noting that \nOdin\n was dead because of him and he had to now remain of Earth to ensure the peace with \nJotunheim\n. However, they all then informed him that Odin was alive and that \nLoki\n was King and had shown the \nFrost Giants\n the way into \nAsgard\n. As they were all talking, they saw another \nWormhole\n in the distance and realized Loki had sent his own forces after them.\n[\n1\n]\nBattle of Puente Antiguo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explains he cannot assist in the fight\n \n \n\"Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this I am truly sorry. But these people are innocent. Taking their lives will gain you nothing. So take mine and end this.\"\nThor to \nLoki\n[src]\nThe group saw that the \nDestroyer\n had arrived in \nNew Mexico\n having been sent by \nLoki\n to kill them all. While \nFandral\n was excited by the idea of Thor joining them into the battle, Thor made it clear that he was now only human, promising to get all the innocent people to safety. Thor and his friends evacuated the town as the \nWarriors Three\n and \nSif\n formulated their plan to stop the Destroyer.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor convinces Lady \nSif\n to save herself\n \n \nThe Destroyer began \nattacking\n the town, destroying everything in its path and knocked back the Warriors Three before being seemingly stopped by Sif's \nsword\n. The Destroyer simply rearranged its body to face Sif and nearly killed her. With this, the Destroyer seemed unstoppable as it continued its firing beams of energy and massive explosions, almost killing \nVolstagg\n. Thor went to Sif's aid and convinced her to escape and live another day.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor bravely faces off against the \nDestroyer\n \n \nWith the Warriors Three all exhausted and nearly defeated from the battle, Thor told them to fall back and reassured them all that he had a plan. While \nHogun\n carried Volstagg to safety, Thor approached the Destroyer and spoke to Loki through it, telling him that he was sorry for whatever he had done to wrong him. Thor pleaded to Loki that he could not allow him to kill all of the innocent people of the town and instead to take his life to protect them all from harm.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sacrifices himself to save innocents\n \n \nLoki seemingly relented as the Destroyer turned and headed back to where it came from; however, just as Thor let out a sigh of relief, Loki used the Destroyer to strike Thor across the face and sent him flying backward. With his bones shattered by the force of the blow, Thor laid on his back dying while \nJane Foster\n came to his aid and sat with him. While she tried to help him, Thor expressed his joy that he had saved her before closing his eyes and dying from his wounds.\n[\n1\n]\nReturn to Strength\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finally regains his powers\n \n \n\"Know this, Son of Coul.

From this day forward, you can count me as your ally, \nif\n you return the items you have taken from Jane.\"\nThor to \nPhil Coulson\n[src]\nWhile all his friends mourned the death of the God of Thunder, the \nDestroyer\n turned around and made its leave. However, before it could get far, \nMjlnir\n sensed Thor's action of self-sacrifice and flew from the \nS.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site\n and straight into Thor's hand, resurrecting him and finally returning his own powers with the burst of lightning, having deemed him worthy due to his self-sacrifice. Thor then stood with the mighty hammer in his \nfull armor\n again.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor successfully defeats the \nDestroyer\n \n \nThor then threw Mjlnir at the Destroyer, knocking it off its feet before he created a tornado around the Destroyer and engaged it, forcibly lifting it high in the air while using Mjlnir to block its deadly beams of energy. Once the Destroyer was at a safe height, Thor flew towards its energy beam, deflecting its power back into its own head causing it to implode and thus disabling it, causing the Destroyer to crash land as Thor walked away from the battle victoriously.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks with \nPhil Coulson\n \n \nWhile \nJane Foster\n and \nErik Selvig\n had marveled at Thor, he was then approached by the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agents, with \nPhil Coulson\n calmly noting that Thor clearly had not been totally honest with him as he reminded him that during their last encounter he had claimed to be \nDonald Blake\n. Thor then told Coulson to return Foster's research if he wanted his help in the future as they both fought on the same side and for the same goal. Although Coulson and Foster debated if S.H.I.E.L.D. had borrowed or stolen her research, Coulson agreed and told Foster they would allow her to continue her work in \nWormhole\n study and understanding.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor says his goodbyes to \nJane Foster\n \n \nThor then promised to show Foster the \nBifrost Bridge\n and flew her to the Bifrost site. When Thor asked \nHeimdall\n for the Bifrost to open so that he could return to \nAsgard\n, Heimdall did not respond, due to him having been betrayed by Loki and frozen with the \nCasket of Ancient Winters\n. Eventually, Heimdall opened the Bridge and Thor then said goodbye to Foster with a kiss, vowing to return for her. The Warriors Three and Lady Sif arrived, and they all returned to Asgard.\n[\n1\n]\nFighting Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finally returns home to \nAsgard\n \n \n\"You can't kill an entire race!\"\n\"Why not?

Thor ordered his friends to get Heimdall to the healing room before searching for his brother. He soon arrived in \nOdin\n's Chamber to see \nFrigga\n with Loki, who had just saved their father from \nLaufey\n, whom he had then killed. Loki was shocked to see his brother as Thor then revealed Loki's true deception and crimes to the horrified Frigga.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to convince \nLoki\n to stop\n \n \nKnowing that his time was limited, Loki sent Thor flying through a wall of the chamber with a shot from \nGungnir\n and headed towards \nHiminbjorg\n where he began the process of destroying \nJotunheim\n. Once Thor arrived, he tried to stop Loki's schemes, but failed. Loki said he did it all to be Thor's equal and he vowed to now destroy Jotunheim using the \nBifrost Bridge\n. Thor refused to fight his brother only to be told they were not true brothers.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles against \nLoki\n \n \nThor tried to convince Loki that his actions were madness, but Loki questioned if that was true and called Thor soft, noting he could have destroyed all the \nFrost Giants\n with his bare hands. When Loki went on to threaten to kill \nJane Foster\n, the now enraged Thor flew forward and attacked Loki, as the pair exchanged blows with their weapons. Although Thor was clearly the stronger of the two, Loki resorted to his tricks to gain the upper hand during their battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is surrounded by \nLoki\n's many illusions\n \n \nEventually, Thor launched forward at his brother, knocking both of them out of Himinbjorg where Loki seemingly nearly fell off the \nRainbow Bridge\n. However, when Thor attempted to save him, Loki revealed it to be another trick and surrounded Thor with illusions of himself, laughing maniacally. After a \ngruesome fight\n, Thor managed to tie Loki down by placing \nMjlnir\n on top of him and went to stop the Bifrost, but saw that it was too far gone to be stopped now.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor begins destroying the \nRainbow Bridge\n \n \nDespite having no other choices, Thor did not want to destroy the Rainbow Bridge because then he could not return to \nEarth\n to see Foster ever again, but for the sake of the \nNine Realms\n, Thor called Mjlnir to him and began destroying the Rainbow Bridge. Loki screamed at him to make him stop, attempting to stab him in the back, but Thor managed to destroy the bridge, causing the energy of the Bifrost to explode and create a \nwormhole\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor watches \nLoki\n fall through a black hole\n \n \nThe massive blast from the Bifrost's destruction launched the fighting brothers into the air where they almost fell into the abyss themselves. However, both Thor and Loki were then caught by Odin who had awakened from the \nOdinsleep\n. Desperate to prove himself worthy in his father's eyes, Loki revealed he did it all for him. However, Odin still rejected him. Thor watched on helplessly as Loki let go and allowed himself to fall into the abyss, falling into the wormhole.\n[\n1\n]\nReflecting on the Future\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor starts leaving the victory celebrations\n \n \n\"There will never be a wiser king than you, or a better father. I have much to learn, I know that now. Someday perhaps, I shall make you proud.\"\n\"You've already made me proud.\"\nThor and \nOdin\n[src]\nAs the \nAsgardians\n celebrated the defeat of the \nFrost Giants\n and the return of their prince, Thor took time to himself, still mourning \nLoki\n's death while thinking about the loss of \nJane Foster\n and if he would ever be reunited with her. Leaving \nVolstagg\n and \nFandral\n to tell the stories of their victory against Loki's schemes, Thor quietly left, touching \nFrigga\n's hand gently as he walked outside.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nOdin\n think of the future of Asgard\n \n \nThor went to see \nOdin\n, who was also thinking of Loki and still mourning his death. Standing beside his father, Thor told him that he was wrong for his \nprior actions\n and that he had a lot to learn from him, hoping to make him proud someday before he took the throne of \nAsgard\n. Odin in return told Thor that he would be a wise king and that he had already made him proud by proving himself worthy of wielding \nMjlnir\n once again and returning home at last.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor thinks about seeing \nJane Foster\n again\n \n \nThor then went to see \nHeimdall\n, who was stood where \nHiminbjorg\n's had once been, with Thor asking if there was now any hope of repairing the \nRainbow Bridge\n as Heimdall told him there was always hope. Thor asked about Foster and Heimdall replied that she was looking for a way to find her way to Asgard.\n[\n1\n]\n Not long after the defeat of Loki, the \nNine Realms\n were endangered by \nMarauders\n, which had put \nVanaheim\n, the home of \nHogun\n in danger of invasion.\n[\n20\n]\nChitauri Invasion\n[\n]\nReturning to Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nOdin sending Thor to Earth\n \n \n\"You miss the truth of ruling, brother. A throne would suit you ill.\"\n\"I've seen worlds you've never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the \nTesseract\n, and when I wield it\"\n\"\nWho\n showed you this power? Who controls the would-be king?\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nTwo years later, \nFrigga\n successfully managed to contact Loki in the \nSanctuary\n. She informed Thor, \nOdin\n and the \nWarriors Three\n of Loki's miraculous survival and that he was planning an attack on \nEarth\n involving the \nTesseract\n and an army of \nChitauri\n. Odin called upon the power of dark energy - the very fabric of the universe itself - to send Thor to Earth to stop him, at the cost of his own and Thor's health. An unconscious Thor landed on a mountain, not far from Loki's location, and began searching for his brother as soon as he regained consciousness.\n[\n20\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finally arrives at his \nbrother\n's location\n \n \nThor caused a lightning storm while he landed on the \nQuinjet\n in which Loki was being escorted on. While the Quinjet was kept steady by \nBlack Widow\n, Thor proceeded to board the jet and was challenged by \nIron Man\n who feared that Thor was attempting to possibly aid or kill Loki before they could find out his plan. However, Thor easily dispatched Iron Man by striking him with \nMjlnir\n, which had caused him to crash into \nCaptain America\n before Thor then ripped Loki out of his restraints and freeing him from their custody and flying off into the distance with his brother to then question Loki personally, while leaving both Captain America and Iron Man stunned as they considered what to do next.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to convince \nLoki\n to surrender\n \n \nOnce they crash landed onto a mountain, Thor tried to convince Loki to give up his plans and return to \nAsgard\n with the Tesseract, though Loki still resented Thor. Thor attempted to reason with his brother by expressing his relief to learn he had survived and informed him that both he and Odin had mourned his death, although the mention of Odin only angered Loki further. It was during their conversation that Thor learned Loki was working for \nsomeone\n, although he never learned who it was. When Loki continued to mock him and refused to answer him, Thor picked up Mjlnir and threatened him.\n[\n4\n]\nConfronted by Iron Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is violently confronted by the \nIron Man\n \n \n\"This is beyond you, metal man. \nLoki\n will face \nAsgardian\n justice.\"\n\"He gives up the \ncube\n, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of the way. Tourist.\"\nThor and \nIron Man\n[src]\nBefore Thor could make another threat, however, \nIron Man\n suddenly attacked him and threw him off the cliff. Having recovered from the sudden \nsurprise attack\n, Thor told him never to touch him again while Iron Man told him not to take his stuff, although Thor argued that Iron Man clearly had no clue what he was getting involved with, promising that \nLoki\n would face \nAsgardian\n justice at \nOdin\n's hand upon returning home. Iron Man remained unmovable in his view, rudely calling Thor \nShakespeare\n in the Park and claiming he was wearing his \nmother\n's clothes before he told Thor to stay out of their way.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor summons his lightning into \nMjlnir\n \n \nSeeing that Iron Man would not listen, Thor attacked by launching \nMjlnir\n at him and preparing to return to Loki who was watching the skirmish with great amusement. However, rather than being defeated by the blow, Iron Man responded by shooting Thor with his repulsor beam and kicking him through a tree. Wishing to end the fight, Thor fired a blast of lightning at the Avenger thinking it would damage it beyond repair. However, \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n informed Iron Man that the blast only served to power \nhis suit\n to incredible levels, allowing him to shoot back at Thor once again, knocking him back with more force.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to crush \nIron Man\n's armor\n \n \nIron Man fought back and the two \ntraded blows\n, flying across the mountain ranges and destroying much of the forest in a desperate attempt to stop the other. Upon crash landing, they punched at each other and managed to catch each other's fists, resulting in a standoff as Thor began crushing Iron Man's Armor. Iron Man responded by shooting Thor in the face and head-butting him, which Thor then responded to with a headbutt of his own while trying to strike his foe with Mjlnir while Iron Man used speed to his advantage, flying all across the battlefield and hitting Thor before he could react.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor meets \nIron Man\n and \nCaptain America\n \n \nWhen \nCaptain America\n intervened and broke up the fight, he pointed out that they should not have been fighting with each other. When he asked Thor to put Mjlnir down, Thor erupted into a rage and in response, knocked Iron Man back and brought Mjlnir down on Captain America, who blocked it with his \nshield\n which absorbed the impact, sending Thor flying backwards. As the warriors recovered from the shockwave, Thor realized, upon seeing all the destruction he had helped to cause, that they had the same goal to stop Loki's plan and protect \nEarth\n, so stopped fighting and formed an alliance.\n[\n4\n]\nWorking with S.H.I.E.L.D.\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor on board the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \nHelicarrier\n \n \n\"\nLoki\n's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth, I courted war.\"\n\"War hasn't started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us what the \nTesseract\n is?\"\n\"I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield. It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me.\"\nThor and \nNick Fury\n[src]\nThey returned to the \nHelicarrier\n, where \nLoki\n was put inside a cell designed to hold and dispose of \nHulk\n if necessary. Thor joined the rest of the team as they watched while \nNick Fury\n questioned Loki, with Thor's brother refusing to give up the location of the \nTesseract\n and mocking their efforts to stop him. With the interrogation over, Thor revealed to the team that Loki had now gathered an entire army of the \nChitauri\n who were not from \nAsgard\n or any other realm known to him. To his shock, Thor learned that Loki had kidnapped \nClint Barton\n as well as \nErik Selvig\n for his schemes, telling them that Selvig was a friend of his.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explains \nLoki\n's plan and motivations\n \n \nWhen \nBruce Banner\n insulted Loki, calling him crazy, Thor was quick to point out that while Loki was unstable, he was his brother, though \nNatasha Romanoff\n brought up that Loki had killed several people, so Thor quickly reasserted that Loki was adopted. (No doubt to erase any suspicions that he could be capable of equally evil actions like Loki.) The group was joined by \nTony Stark\n who explained what Loki needed Selvig for while teasing Thor for their earlier fight, calling him \nPoint Break\n while they all began searching for Loki across the entire globe.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor asks \nPhil Coulson\n about \nJane Foster\n \n \nLater, he asked \nPhil Coulson\n about \nJane Foster\n and was told that she was moved into a secure location when Loki returned and Selvig was put under his control. Thor personally thanked Coulson for this action to protect the woman he loved and discussed how he viewed Selvig as a good man, noting that Loki would have targeted him due to their friendship, with Coulson explaining that Selvig often spoke of his own encounter with Thor.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor talks of \nLoki\n's personal hatred for him\n \n \nThor expressed his displeasure at the way the \nAsgardians\n claimed to be a more advanced race within the \nNine Realms\n but now their own wars would often be fought on \nEarth\n, leaving the \nhumans\n to pay the price, comparing their wars to the fights of the \nBilgesnipe\n, but he did have to explain to Coulson what the Bilgesnipe were and how they trample everything within their path. Thor noted how Loki's rage had followed him to \nNew Mexico\n where he had fought the \nDestroyer\n to protect innocent lives. Thor noted that in his youth he had desired war, but seeing the reality had now changed his views.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor discusses \nLoki\n with \nNick Fury\n \n \nTheir conversation was interrupted when Fury then approached and asked Thor if he believed he could make him confess where the Tesseract was, but Thor insisted that all Loki really desired was his revenge against his family for \nOdin\n's lies about his true heritage. Fury then asked what Thor was prepared to do in order to keep all Loki's plans from reaching fruition, though Thor told him that he was still unsure. When Thor noted that Loki was still their prisoner, Fury noted that Loki clearly had his plans, as he appeared to be the only person on board the Helicarrier who actually wanted to be there.\n[\n4\n]\nAvengers Argument\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor argues with all of the other \nAvengers\n \n \n\"Your work with the \nTesseract\n is what drew \nLoki\n to it, and his \nallies\n. It is the signal to all the realms that the \nEarth\n is ready for a higher form of war.\"\nThor to \nNick Fury\n[src]\nThor rejoined the \nAvengers\n alongside \nNatasha Romanoff\n inside the laboratory just as an argument was breaking out between them all, as \nTony Stark\n had just now learned that \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n was using the power of the \nTesseract\n to recreate the weapons of \nHYDRA\n and had not informed the team of this fact. Director \nNick Fury\n noted that they were building the weapons because of the threat of \nAsgardians\n, pointing to Thor who insisted his people wanted peace with \nMidgard\n, although Fury noted Asgardians were not the only threat.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor laughs at \nTony Stark\n and \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWhile \nTony Stark\n and \nSteve Rogers\n were standing up to each other about what to do next in the wake of all of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's own secrets being uncovered, they attempted to start a fight with each other, something Thor found amusing as he called \nHumans\n both petty and tiny for getting into such arguments with one another. While Thor argued that their tests on the Tesseract had attracted \nLoki\n's attention and the attention of his \nallies\n in the first place, their argument was quickly ended as \nBruce Banner\n inadvertently picked up the \nScepter\n, proving Loki was manipulating his mind in order to divide them all.\n[\n4\n]\nAttack on the Helicarrier\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to reason with \nHulk\n \n \n\"We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!\"\nThor to \nHulk\n[src]\nAs Thor and the others argued, \nHawkeye\n, under \nLoki\n's mind control, managed to use his trick arrows to blow up one of the \nHelicarrier\n's engines, causing a massive fireball to strike into the room which all of the \nAvengers\n were in. Thor was knocked back while the blast also triggered \nBruce Banner\n to transform into \nHulk\n. Thor found Hulk moments before he would have killed \nBlack Widow\n, knocking him through a wall. Thor fought Hulk, being the only one who could match him for strength. As Thor held off Hulk's massive arm, Thor tried and failed to reason with Banner, hoping he was still inside Hulk's mind.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor regains \nMjlnir\n to get more power\n \n \nHulk, however, then managed to lift up Thor and punched him through the hanger, causing Thor's nose to bleed from the impact of such a powerful punch. Unafraid of the beast and it's incredible strength, Thor summoned \nMjlnir\n to his hand and used it to strike Hulk across the face, knocking him into a jet. Thor soon learned that these sorts of attacks only added to Hulk's rage as he ripped the jet apart and threw it at Thor. As a result, Thor used Mjlnir to pin Hulk to the ground before trying to choke him out with all of his might while Hulk let out a mighty roar of anger while he tried to escape Thor's grasp.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor strikes \nHulk\n hard across the face\n \n \nAs their battle continued while \nCaptain America\n and \nIron Man\n still attempted to fix the Helicarrier and keep it from falling out of the sky, Hulk started to gain the upper hand against Thor and threw him around like a ragdoll across the ship. Eventually, Thor was aided as a single \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n jet, sent by \nNick Fury\n, fired upon Hulk. Thor managed to avoid the bullets while the furious Hulk then turned his attention to the Jet, which caused him to leap from the Helicarrier and rip it from the sky, falling to \nEarth\n as a result, saving Thor from further beatings from the Incredible Hulk's fury.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor falls for \nLoki\n's illusion tricks again\n \n \nWith the threat of Hulk's incredible rage finally over, Thor then went to make sure that \nLoki\n was still being contained inside the Helicarrier. When he arrived, however, Thor discovered that the cell door was being opened and Loki was leaving, Thor desperately tried to stop Loki from leaving, but it turned out to be an illusion and Thor became trapped in the cell, as Loki looked upon his brother and mocked him for once again falling for his deceptions. Thor tried to break the glass, but this caused the cell to almost fall from the sky as Loki then mocked Thor's dangerous current situation.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor watches \nLoki\n murdering \nPhil Coulson\n \n \nLoki threatened to drop the cage, noting how the \nhumans\n believed that \nAsgardians\n were immortal and he wished to test the theory by sending Thor falling to his death. However, Loki was just about to drop the cage when \nPhil Coulson\n confronted him with the \nDestroyer Armor Prototype Gun\n which had been created from the remains that had been gathered from the \nDestroyer\n. However, before Coulson could recapture Loki and free Thor, Loki used another illusion to get behind Coulson stabbed him through the heart, as Thor yelled out in anger at seeing his ally mortally wounded and slowly dying.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor manages to escape falling to his death\n \n \nThor looked on helplessly as Loki then showed him Agent Coulson's blood still on his \nScepter\n's blade before he then dropped him out of the \nHelicarrier\n, wishing to finally kill his own brother once and for all. As he plummeted towards the Earth at incredible speeds, Thor was thrown from side to side and was still unable to hit the glass, but he eventually managed to secure himself against a wall and used the power of Mjlnir to smash free from the cell's solid glass walls just in time to avoid the impact as the cell smashed against some rocks and was completely destroyed as a direct result of the crash.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is briefly unworthy to pick up \nMjlnir\n \n \nHaving escaped the impact of the near-deadly crash landing, Thor landed heavily in an empty field, dropping Mjlnir upon his hard landing on Earth. Afterwards, having been separated from the rest of the \nAvengers\n and wishing to continue the battle to stop the \nChitauri Invasion\n, Thor then went looking for Mjlnir. When Thor eventually found and then tried to pick his mighty hammer up again, he learned his connection to Mjlnir had temporarily been severed due to his rage after witnessing Loki murder his friend as well as causing such massive destruction across the realm that Thor loved.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor regaining all his strength from \nMjlnir\n \n \nThor managed to calm himself down as he clenched his own fist and recalled the lessons taught to him by King \nOdin\n. He then picked up the hammer and regained his power by summoning a lightning bolt from the heavens, which gifted him not only with his great power back, but a new \nbattle armor\n which then fell from the heavens and wrapped itself around Thor. Now ready for battle, Thor then went searching for both Loki and the rest of the Avengers, who were all currently in \nNew York City\n, in order to complete his mission to stop Loki's plans for complete world domination.\n[\n4\n]\nConfronting Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to stop \nLoki\n's schemes\n \n \n\"Loki! Turn off the \nTesseract\n or I'll destroy it!\"\n\"You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only... the war!\"\n\"So be it.\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nHaving recovered, Thor used \nMjlnir\n's powers to replenish his own strength before he went to \nNew York City\n to confront \nLoki\n. Upon arriving at \nStark Tower\n once Loki had used the \nTesseract\n to open a \nportal\n allowing the \nChitauri\n and \nLeviathans\n to invade the \nEarth\n, Thor confronted his brother while \nIron Man\n clashed with the invading Chitauri. Giving Loki a final warning, Thor ordered him to turn off the Tesseract or he would destroy it, only for Loki to tell him it could not be destroyed.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights \nLoki\n on top of \nStark Tower\n \n \nSeeing that Loki could not be stopped, Thor prepared himself as Loki leapt off Stark Tower and attacked him with the \nScepter\n, with Thor using Mjlnir to defend himself as all of their blows caused massive damage to the Tower while Loki destroyed the \nAvengers\n' \nQuinjet\n and causing it to crash. While locked in their battle, Thor again tried to convince him to stop, since the Chitauri were destroying the world he wanted to rule, telling him the madness of the battle would not end with his rule. Loki told Thor it was too late to stop the carnage, but Thor told him they could find a way to do it together.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor soon overpowers and defeats \nLoki\n \n \nAlthough Loki appeared to relent, smiling with tears in his eyes at Thor's promise, he instead revealed a hidden blade and stabbed his brother in the side, mocking him for all his sentiment. Furious, Thor attacked Loki and beat him into submission, lifting him high into the air before slamming his body painfully onto the ground. Thor prepared to capture Loki and end the \nChitauri Invasion\n, only to witness Loki escape as he fled on a \nChitauri Chariot\n. With his brother now flying across the battlefield, Thor removed the blade from in his side and prepared to join his new allies in defeating the Chitauri.\n[\n4\n]\nBattle of New York\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor rejoins the other remaining \nAvengers\n \n \n\"I have unfinished business with \nLoki\n.\"\n\"Yeah? Well, get in line.\"\nThor and \nHawkeye\n[src]\nHaving seen that he could no longer catch up with \nLoki\n and wishing to protect the innocent lives of the people in \nNew York City\n, Thor rejoined the other \nAvengers\n onto the battlefield, bringing down his lightning to destroy a small band of \nChitauri\n fighters. Upon joining the others, Thor explained that the \nTesseract\n was impenetrable before noting that he still planned on defeating Loki, to which \nHawkeye\n expressed his own desire to get revenge on the God of Mischief. \nCaptain America\n ordered them to stay focused until he heard a now incoming motorcycle.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor listens to \nCaptain America\n's orders\n \n \nSeeing that \nBruce Banner\n was riding the motorcycle, the Avengers greeted their ally who noted how horrible the \nBattle of New York\n was. While Thor looked on, Banner personally challenged an incoming \nLeviathan\n by transforming into \nHulk\n and destroying it, with Thor blocking the explosion with his own arm. Captain America then took command of all of the Avengers and gave them each their mission plans for the battle, ordering Thor to use all his power of lightning to stem the flow of enemies coming through the \nportal\n, which Thor then agreed to without question as he flew into position.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor using his lightning to block the portal\n \n \nFollowing Captain America's new orders for him, Thor then flew onto the top of the \nChrysler Building\n where he used the building to charge his lightning bolts into \nMjlnir\n before unleashing them onto the portal, destroying much of Loki's entire oncoming army, causing massive explosions that killed many of the incoming \nLeviathans\n that were attempting to attack New York City as well as the oncoming horde of \nChitauri Chariots\n. However, this incredible use of power took its toll on Thor and he was forced to stop and continue the battle on the ground alongside all of his own fellow Avengers.\n[\n4\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nHulk\n after killing a large Leviathan\n \n \nWhile flying around in \nNew York City\n, Iron Man asked Thor if he had ever seen \nGame of Thrones\n, saying he reminded him of it. Thor then asked Iron Man how he could make jokes in the middle of a war.\n[\n21\n]\n He later helped Hulk bring down a \nLeviathan\n; they fought the Chitauri army on top of the beast until together they ripped out a section of its armor and rammed it into its skull, killing the beast and causing it to crash into \nGrand Central Station\n. As the pair were both taking a moment to catch their breath, Hulk punched Thor across the room in revenge for their \nearlier fight\n, smugly chuckling to himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor rides on board a flying \nChitauri Chariot\n \n \nAs the battle raged on, the more powerful Thor then attempted to use his own \nAsgardian\n strength and skills to destroy the enemies flying through the sky. Therefore, Thor sought to bring down the \nChitauri Chariots\n that were flying through the city, but while riding on the back of one Chariot, Thor was knocked off when a Leviathan smashed through a building and knocked him off his feet. With the forces taking over the city, Thor was forced to join the Avengers in taking on the army of seemingly unending foot soldiers, beating them back despite the overwhelming odds against them all.\n[\n4\n]\nClosing the Portal\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting alongside \nCaptain America\n \n \n\"You ready for another bout?\"\n\"What, you getting sleepy?\"\nThor and \nCaptain America\n[src]\nThor then joined forces with \nCaptain America\n during a skirmish with a unit of \nChitauri\n soldiers. During the fight, Rogers received a shot to his side which knocked him down, Thor defended his fellow Avenger by using \nMjlnir\n to throw a car at the incoming soldiers before then throwing it in the opposite direction to knock out other soldiers. Thor helped Rogers to his feet and asked if he was ready to continue fighting, to which Rogers jokingly asked him if he was sleepy. Seeing that Rogers was indeed prepared to fight now until the end, Thor reclaimed Mjlnir.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor watches \nIron Man\n fall from space\n \n \nSoon \nGideon Malick\n and all of the \nWorld Security Council\n made the decision to send a nuclear missile into the heart of the city, intending to destroy the \nportal\n at the sacrifice of everyone in the city. \nIron Man\n sent the missile intended for the city through the portal, which then destroyed the \nChitauri Command Center\n, cutting off the forces power source and killing them, while \nBlack Widow\n closed the portal. Thor and \nCaptain America\n watched as Iron Man fell from the sky and before Thor could catch him, \nHulk\n then launched through the air and caught Stark before dropping him off at the Avengers' feet.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks to \nIron Man\n after the battle\n \n \nTo see if their ally had died due to his lack of air while in space, Thor ripped off Stark's mask and for a moment it appeared he had been killed; however, a roar from Hulk soon awoke him with a shocking start. Thor deemed them not to be finished until \nLoki\n was finally captured, although Stark requested that they go eat shawarma as soon as possible. Thor joined the other Avengers in confronting Loki, who had already been heavily wounded and battered by Hulk, and took him into custody.\n[\n4\n]\nReturning to Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor meets \nAlexander Pierce\n \n \n\"May I ask you where you're going?\"\n\"To lunch and then \nAsgard\n.\"\n\nAlexander Pierce\n and Thor\n[src]\nAs the \nAvengers\n apprehended \nLoki\n, a group of \nSTRIKE\n operatives who were \nHYDRA\n sleeper agents in disguise including \nBrock Rumlow\n, \nJasper Sitwell\n and \nJack Rollins\n arrived at the \nStark Tower\n, taking the \nScepter\n into \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n custody. As \nTony Stark\n and Thor exited the building, they were approached by \nAlexander Pierce\n, who demanded that Thor hand over Loki and the \nTesseract\n. Despite the Secretary's demand, Thor was allowed to take them both back to \nAsgard\n.\n[\n22\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor returns to \nAsgard\n with \nLoki\n \n \nThor and the other Avengers went into the \nShawarma Palace\n and ate silently.\n[\n4\n]\n They were soon interrupted by \nWar Machine\n, who arrived just too late to help fight in their battle.\n[\n23\n]\n After being allowed to reclaim the Tesseract by \nNick Fury\n, despite the many objections of \nGideon Malick\n, Thor said goodbye to the Avengers and \nErik Selvig\n before taking Loki with him back to \nAsgard\n to await his trial by opening a portal with the Tesseract and leaving all the other Avengers in \nCentral Park\n.\n[\n4\n]\n The existence of Thor disproved many myths, causing students like \nPeter Parker\n to study him in Physics class.\n[\n24\n]\nWar of the Nine Realms\n[\n]\nSearch for the Crown of Fools\n[\n]\nDespite having brought \nLoki\n back to \nAsgard\n to be imprisoned, his brother's actions still loomed over \nAsgard\n. Loki's findings of the secret passageways through Asgard caused much of the wildlife to pick up weird tendencies like attacking the \nWarriors Three\n. Thor set off on an adventure with \nSif\n and the Warriors Three to find the source of the weird tendencies. They found an ancient castle inside a crater, which they infiltrated. Thor then saw Loki sitting on the window sill of the castle after being freed by \nOdin\n. Loki asked if they could rule Asgard together, to which Thor agreed. Loki then told him that they could have been tyrants. This phrase knocked Thor back to himself and realized that it was an illusion. He was then attacked by the Warriors Three, who were enthralled. Thor found the thraller, a \nFrost Giant\n wearing the \nCrown of Fools\n. Thor knocked the crown off its head, which revealed that the Frost Giant himself was being enthralled by the crown. The Frost Giant apologized as Thor took him back to \nJotunheim\n.\n[\n25\n]\nBattle of Vanaheim\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battling the invading \nMarauders\n army\n \n \n\"I've got this completely under control.\"\n\"Is that why everything is on fire?\"\n\nSif\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor discovered that \nVanaheim\n was getting slowly taken over by \nMarauders\n who were now taking advantage of the chaotic time. Thor gave \nHeimdall\n the \nTesseract\n so he that could use its energy to repair the \nRainbow Bridge\n so that the \nAsgardians\n could access the \nBifrost Bridge\n once more in order to protect the Nine Realms once again. He then, with an army of Asgardians, went to end the threats controlling the Nine Realms.\n[\n21\n]\n In \n2011\n, a group of ragtag invaders known as the Marauders started a war across all the \nNine Realms\n. Thor, now a full-time general of the Asgardian army, bravely led all of his own forces in a fight against the attackers.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor protects \nVanaheim\n from \nMarauders\n \n \nWith Lady \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n, they teamed up to and fought the invading army. When Thor arrived on the battlefield in Vanaheim, the homeworld of \nHogun\n, the battle was already underway, and Thor used his lightning to create a shockwave that knocked down a small band of the Marauders. Lady \nSif\n insisted that she had the situation completely under control, but Thor only teased her by noting that everything around her was on fire before being attacked.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is challenged by a \nKronan Stone Man\n \n \nAs the battle continued, Thor and Sif fought side by side until the battle paused when a \nKronan Stone Man\n appeared and challenged Thor to single combat. The \nMarauders\n celebrated as they believed Thor would be unable to defeat the monster. Sif allowed Thor to fight it alone and Thor calmly joked that he accepted its surrender. When the monster appeared to still want to fight, Thor killed it with a single blow from \nMjlnir\n, which caused the invaders to surrender.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nHogun\n say farewell after a battle\n \n \nWith this final victory, the two-year war with the Marauders was over and the \nAsgardians\n restored peace to the \nNine Realms\n while all the invaders were taken to the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n. As the people of Vanaheim returned to their homes, Thor spoke to \nHogun\n, telling him to stay there with his people to help them recover from the battle, for which Hogun was very grateful for the thought. The pair shook hands before Thor then left Vanaheim via the \nBifrost Bridge\n.\n[\n9\n]\nCelebration\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor seeks some advice from \nOdin\n \n \n\"It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are \nNine Realms\n. The future king of \nAsgard\n must focus on more than one.\"\n\"I thank you for your \nsword\n and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.\"\n\nSif\n and Thor\n[src]\nWith \nVanaheim\n now safe, along with \nNornheim\n and \nRia\n, and all the remaining \nMarauders\n having been rounded up and all then sent into the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n for the foreseeable future, Thor and all his allies then returned to \nAsgard\n to update his father, King \nOdin\n on their success. Thor noted that they would have had their victory much earlier if Odin had joined them on the battlefield, only for Odin to question why Thor was still harboring his own feelings for \nJane Foster\n, noting that it was foolish for an Asgardian to love a mortal human woman.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor considers his own future as king\n \n \nThor returned to his own room within the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n where he bathed to prepare for the upcoming celebrations for the Asgardian's recent victory in the \nWar of the Nine Realms\n. However, instead of being joyful, Thor remained melancholy as he stepped to his window and looked out over Asgard, considering if his future remained there as King of Asgard, or if he should have returned to \nEarth\n to reunite with his new allies, the \nAvengers\n and pursue a future with Foster.\n[\n9\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor drinks with \nVolstagg\n and \nFandral\n \n \nA party was held for Thor for restoring the peace throughout the \nNine Realms\n, which soon moved into one of the caverns within Asgard. While \nVolstagg\n and \nFandral\n both remained in high spirits, drinking and telling war stories about the many adventures and other battles involving the \nWarriors Three\n with the beautiful women as well as Volstagg's children, Thor remained somewhat silent throughout the celebration and soon left the party, allowing his friends to continue enjoying themselves as Volstagg smashed his glass on the floor and demanded another drink, leading to many joyful cheers.\n[\n26\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks with Lady \nSif\n after their battle\n \n \nBefore he could leave, Thor was stopped by Lady \nSif\n who reminded him of how they used to celebrate their victories for weeks at a time, as they reminisced about a previous battle in \nHarokin\n which Sif had almost restarted during the celebration of their victory. Sif then asked him if he would have a drink with her, noting that Odin could not have another task for him at this time; he kindly refused and thanked her for her company, telling her that this was a task he had given unto himself, not from the Allfather. Sif, however, noted that the future King of Asgard should focus on all the Realms, not just \nMidgard\n which she knew was his reason for leaving the celebrations early.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor asks \nHeimdall\n about \nJane Foster\n \n \nHe walked to the end of the \nRainbow Bridge\n and arrived at \nHiminbjorg\n where he was greeted by the Guardian of Asgard as they discussed the Nine Realms and his ability to see all the souls throughout it. Once again, Thor asked \nHeimdall\n to see how Jane Foster was doing back on \nEarth\n. Heimdall told Thor that Foster was indeed smart and was studying the \nConvergence\n: however, to his surprise, he found himself currently unable to see her.\n[\n9\n]\nSecond Dark Elf Conflict\n[\n]\nProtecting Jane Foster\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor returns to \nEarth\n to find \nJane Foster\n \n \n\"The \nBifrost\n was destroyed. The \nNine Realms\n erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.\"\n\"As excuses go, that's not terrible.\"\nThor and \nJane Foster\n[src]\nFearing for her safety, Thor returned to \nEarth\n and then went to finally reunite with \nJane Foster\n to ensure that she was okay. Using the information gathered, Thor knew that Foster was in \nLondon\n and soon found her, at which point Foster noticed a circle of rain around her; then Thor appeared.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is finally reunited with \nJane Foster\n \n \nFoster slapped him in the face to check if he was real, and then one more time for taking three years to visit her even though he was on Earth during the \nBattle of New York\n. Thor noted that he had spent the time battling against the \nMarauders\n who had threatened the \nNine Realms\n while keeping the peace throughout \nAsgard\n, an excuse that Foster soon accepted as Thor noted that he had done everything within his power to protect her from dangers of the universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor takes \nJane Foster\n to \nAsgard\n \n \nWhile \nDarcy Lewis\n also caught up with Thor and asked how space was doing, one of the police officers at the scene attempted to arrest Foster, Lewis and \nIan Boothby\n for trespassing, only to be blown back by the \nAether\n which had bonded with Foster's body and was giving her seemingly uncontrollable power. Seeking to get her some aid, Thor grabbed Foster to returned to Asgard with her, calling on \nHeimdall\n to summon the \nBifrost Bridge\n to them and return him home.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor takes \nJane Foster\n to be checked on\n \n \nWishing to get her medical aid, Thor had \nEir\n take Foster and use the \nSoul Forge\n to analyze Foster's condition, with Thor being amused by Foster's constant questions of how \nAsgardian\n technology worked. They were then interrupted when \nOdin\n arrived in the room to tell him to take Foster back to Earth despite Thor's protests. However, when the guards attempted to remove her, they were all once again blown backward by the \nAether\n's incredible power coming from her.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns of \nMalekith\n and the \nDark Elves\n \n \nSeeing the potential danger, Odin took Thor and Foster away and showed them the \nBook of Yggdrasil\n which explained to them that the Aether was created by the \nDark Elves\n from the Reality Stone thousands of years ago as their greatest leader, \nMalekith\n, had attempted to use it's power to destroy the universe before being defeated by \nBor\n who wiped out the Dark Elves. When Foster asked how to be freed from the Aether before it killed her, Odin confessed to not knowing how to do that.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor walks \nJane Foster\n through Asgard\n \n \nSeeking to understand more of the Aether's power and hoping to save her, Odin allowed Foster to stay in \nAsgard\n until the Aether could be safely removed from her. Thor and Foster spent time together in Asgard, exploring their culture, and Thor explained to her the story behind the \nConvergence\n which had caused her to come in contact with the Aether through the \nNine Realms\n, vowing to use his great power to protect her from harm despite his own father's wishes. They shared a kiss and were interrupted by Thor's mother \nFrigga\n, who teased them both while Thor introduced her to Foster, much to Foster's great awkward amazement which Thor enjoyed.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor hears of a riot breaking out in \nAsgard\n \n \nThor made the introductions but while they were talking, \nAlgrim\n had used the power of a \nKursed Stone\n to give himself new power and break himself and many others free of the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n. Thor soon became distracted by an alarm at the dungeons, and knowing that \nLoki\n was also there and fearing for his escape. Frigga promised to look after Foster while Thor summoned \nMjlnir\n and flew towards the Dungeons to investigate the still ongoing chaos.\n[\n9\n]\nSacking of Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles all of the escaped prisoners\n \n \n\"Return to your cells, and no harm will come to you! You have my word... Very well, you do not have my word.\"\nThor to the \nMarauders\n[src]\nWhen the \nDark Elves\n invaded \nAsgard\n, Thor then flew into battle and, using his reputation as a greatly feared \nAsgardian\n warrior, ordered the prisoners to stop their current riot and then return to their cells within the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n. However, when they refused and continued to fight, Thor battled them alongside \nVolstagg\n, \nFandral\n and the remaining prison guards, noting that the prisoners no longer had their word that they would not harm them during the battle. Throughout the ensuing skirmish, \nLoki\n remained in his cell, reading a book, and did not get involved in the conflict, much to Thor's own great personal relief.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor hears the arrival of the \nDark Elves\n \n \nHaving helped to quell the riot, Thor was unable to stop the \nDark Elf Harrows\n from flying past \nHeimdall\n's warships, as \nKurse\n destroyed Asgard's defenses and allowed their ships to attack. Thor felt the entire palace shake as \nMalekith\n's ship crash-landed in the Great Hall. Thor continued assisting the \nWarriors Three\n in securing all the remaining prisoners as the \nEinherjar\n battled the Dark Elves who used their own small army to charge through the palace.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to kill \nMalekith\n \n \nThor ran to the aid of his people and arrived just in time to witness his own mother, \nFrigga\n, fall down bleeding on the ground from being stabbed in the heart by \nKurse\n. In great anger, Thor burned half of Malekith's face off with a lightning bolt and then threw his hammer, \nMjlnir\n, into Kurse and Malekith, sending them back to their \nArk\n ship and repelling the invasion, although Thor was unable to kill either of them or destroy their ship before it vanished from view.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor looking somberly at \nFrigga\n's corpse\n \n \nNow too late to do anything more, Thor summoned Mjlnir back to his hand just as \nOdin\n arrived in the room armed with \nGungnir\n only to find his own beloved wife dead. \nJane Foster\n also appeared from her hiding place, as Frigga had used her \nmagic\n to hide her and sacrificed her own life to protect hers. Thor then just watched as his father fell to his knees and cradled Frigga's lifeless body in his arms, mourning the loss of his wife who had been with him for centuries.\n[\n9\n]\nRecruiting His Allies\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attends \nFrigga\n's funeral\n \n \n\"What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. \nMalekith\n knew the \nAether\n was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of \nAsgard\n.\"\nThor to \nHeimdall\n[src]\nIn the wake of the \nSacking of Asgard\n, a funeral was later held for the dead \nAsgardians\n and Queen \nFrigga\n. Thor attended and with \nJane Foster\n by his side, he watched his mother transform into stars into the \nMultiverse\n as the Asgardians showed their respects to their late Queen.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor debates what to do with \nMalekith\n \n \nThor knew that \nMalekith\n would soon return for the \nAether\n, and, once he learned that King \nOdin\n had locked Foster away in \nAsgard\n, Thor interrupted a military meeting as he desperately tried to convince Odin that Malekith would return and destroy Asgard in order to get the Aether. Thor explained his plan to trick Malekith by taking him away from Asgard and then destroy the Aether himself, but blinded by hate and grief, Odin would not let Thor move Foster.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor argues with King \nOdin\n \n \nOdin then told Thor that he planned to fight a new war with the \nDark Elves\n, as his own father \nBor\n had done until they were wiped from existence. However, during their argument, it became clear that Odin was becoming weaker and uneasy on his feet. When Odin swore that the Asgardians would fight until the last breath and noted he believed they would win, Thor knew in his heart that they would not win a war with Malekith's great army of undetectable Dark Elves.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor quietly asks for \nHeimdall\n's assistance\n \n \nDisheartened by Odin's orders not to seek out Malekith himself, Thor then devised a plan to move Foster even if he would then commit treason and in the worst case get them killed. Meeting \nHeimdall\n at one of Asgard's caverns, they discussed how Heimdall could no longer see the Dark Elves and the \nBifrost Bridge\n had been closed off. Thor spoke to Heimdall about Malekith and the Dark Elves, noting that Odin's decision was a poor one made out of both his hatred and mourning and requested Heimdall's aid in getting himself and Foster off-world, if he could have kept quiet. Heimdall agreed to help, despite knowing this action would be considered high treason.\n[\n9\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor secretly meets with the \nWarriors Three\n \n \nSince \nLoki\n managed to get three \nFrost Giants\n into \nAsgard\n,\n[\n1\n]\n Thor hoped that he could take them to \nSvartalfheim\n to ambush Malekith. Seeking more allies for his mission, Thor gathered Lady \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n for a secret meeting where he explained to them his plan to free Loki, much to \nVolstagg\n's horror while \nFandral\n then reminded him that Loki would more than likely betray him yet again, which Thor acknowledged was true but remained confident.\n[\n9\n]\nFreeing Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor makes a deal with \nLoki\n in his cell\n \n \n\"When we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you.\"\nThor to \nLoki\n[src]\nThor traveled into the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n and spoke to \nLoki\n. Thor knew that Loki was maintaining an illusion and forced him to reveal the truth, that Loki had trashed his cell with grief upon learning of \nFrigga\n's death at the hands of \nKurse\n, who he had aided. Thor promised Loki that if he had helped him then he would free him from his cell and grant him revenge for their mother's death. Loki agreed.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor breaking Loki out of the dungeons\n \n \nThor and Loki made their escape through the halls of \nAsgard\n. To remain unnoticed Loki then disguised himself as a \nEinherjar\n guard. However, when it became clear he was now annoying Thor with his constant talking, Loki decided to have more fun and changed Thor's appearance into \nSif\n and his own into \nCaptain America\n, mocking Thor as he went about his friendship with the \nAvengers\n as he joked about Captain America's own grand patriotism.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sneakily puts handcuffs on \nLoki\n \n \nLosing his patience, Thor pinned Loki against a wall when he spotted some guards, while Loki requested his \ndagger\n but Thor instead gave him a brand new pair of handcuffs, teasingly reminding Loki about how he normally enjoyed tricks like that.\n[\n9\n]\n When they became corned by more Einherjar guards, Thor dropped \nMjlnir\n and informed Loki that he did not intend to kill his Asgardian allies. Thor then proceeded to subdue the guards with just his own bare hands.\n[\n26\n]\nEscape from Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor gets some assistance from Lady \nSif\n \n \n\"Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the best pilot.\"\n\"Is that right? Well, out of the two of us, which one can actually fly?\"\n\nLoki\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor and \nLoki\n then regrouped with Lady \nSif\n who had successfully rescued \nJane Foster\n while \nHeimdall\n was still distracting Odin within \nHiminbjorg\n. Once Thor had thanked Sif and \nVolstagg\n for agreeing to stay behind and keep the \nEinherjar\n at bay, he, Foster and Loki boarded the \nDark Elf Harrow\n which had crashed in the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n. Sif and Volstagg both first personally took the chance to threaten Loki.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and Loki on the \nDark Elf Harrow\n \n \nWhile Sif and Volstagg delayed the guards, Thor attempted to get the Dark Elf Harrow going, while Loki continued to criticize him, much to Thor's great annoyance. Once they got going, Thor flew the Harrow across Asgard with the Einherjar chasing after him. Loki continued mocking him, especially when he destroyed a statue of \nBor\n. Nearing their exit point, Thor flew out beside the \nBifrost Bridge\n, pushed out Loki and jumped out himself with a sick Foster in his arms.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor gets away with \nFandral\n's assistance\n \n \nThey all landed on a smaller \nAsgardian Skiff\n that \nFandral\n had been driving as Loki noted how impressed he was that Thor had actually managed to trick him. They were hunted by an Asgardian patrol, but Fandral went over to their ship and knocked out the soldiers, allowing them to get away without being seen. Loki then took control of the Skiff and drove through the secret passageway that took them to \nSvartalfheim\n, delighting in his great success.\n[\n9\n]\nFighting Malekith\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor promises to still protect \nJane Foster\n \n \n\"What good were you in your cell?\"\n\"Who put me there? WHO PUT ME THERE?!\"\n\"YOU KNOW DAMN WELL! YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHO!\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nThe trio successfully landed in the wastelands of \nSvartalfheim\n where they explored the remains from the \nFirst Battle of Svartalfheim\n. As they moved through the wreckage of various \nArks\n, Thor cared for \nJane Foster\n as she slowly regained all of her strength. \nLoki\n began to mock Thor about his love for a mortal woman, noting that she would die long before he would. When Thor asked if this would satisfy him, Loki claimed satisfaction was not within his nature.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor argues with \nLoki\n yet again\n \n \nThor noted that surrender was not in his nature as Loki accused him of locking him in the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n. This led to an intense argument between the two leading to Thor nearly punching his own brother. He stepped back when he thought how \nFrigga\n would not want them to fight. Loki, however, said she would not be surprised. They shared a laugh and started to talk about wanting to trust Loki; Loki told him to trust his rage as they continued onward.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor notes that he still does not trust \nLoki\n \n \nThey made their way through Svartalfheim and, while sitting on a cliff top, they all saw \nMalekith\n stepping out of his ship with all of his small army of \nDark Elves\n. Having already made a plan to deceive Malekith to gain the upper hand, Thor unlocked Loki's handcuffs while Loki once again asked Thor if he trusted him when Thor asked if he would trust himself, Loki said he could not as he drew his own dagger from just underneath his own long cloak.\n \n \n \n \n \nLoki\n pretends to slice off Thor's own hand\n \n \nLoki then proceeded to use his dagger to stab Thor in the side and throw him off a cliff where he rolled to the feet of the Dark Elves. He kicked and beat Thor while claiming he only ever wanted both him and \nOdin\n dead at his feet before cutting Thor's hand off. Malekith, who had been there waiting for them, listened as Loki told him that all he wanted in return for the gift of both Foster and the Aether was a good spot where he could see \nAsgard\n burn down.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to destroy the \nAether\n \n \nAs Malekith was unsure of Loki, \nKurse\n then stepped forward and remembered seeing Loki during the \nSacking of Asgard\n, so he told Malekith that Loki was an enemy of Asgard. Malekith then began to draw the \nAether\n from Foster but while he was still absorbing it, Thor shouted Loki's name. Loki had only created an illusion of cutting off Thor's arm and Thor called for \nMjlnir\n. He then shot a lightning bolt on the Aether, causing it to then explode.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees the \nMalekith\n absorb the \nAether\n \n \nLoki jumped on top of Foster to prevent the Aether explosion from hitting her while Thor waited to ensure the Aether was indeed destroyed. To his horror, however, the Aether proved to be too powerful due to being one of the \nInfinity Stones\n and Malekith then proceeded to absorb it into his own body, becoming vastly more powerful before he turned and left, telling Kurse and some of the Dark Elves to take care of the rest while he was gone.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nLoki\n prepare to fight together\n \n \nSeeking to kill them Kurse threw a \nBlack Hole Grenade\n in the air and, before it could kill Foster, Loki pushed her out of the way and almost got sucked in himself but Thor managed to save him by knocking him out of the sky. Seeing Malekith was about to get away on board the \nArk\n, Thor left Loki behind with Foster as he then launched himself forward with the power of Mjlnir at the Dark Elf, but was knocked hard out of the way by Kurse's powerful strike.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is beaten into submission by \nKurse\n \n \nQuickly recovering from the powerful strike, Thor rose to his feet as Kurse walked towards him and they began to \nbattle\n each other, with Kurse taking advantage of Thor's surprise at the Dark Elf's strength since using a \nKurse Stone\n. Thor was then thrown into a mountain and had a heavy boulder thrown at him. Kurse even managed to knock Mjlnir off its path before he started to violently beat up Thor, pounding Thor into the ground repeatedly with force.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nKurse\n mortally wounding \nLoki\n \n \nBefore Thor could be beaten to death, however, Loki then stabbed Kurse through the back with a sword. Kurse, being \"the last of the Kursed,\" was not injured and he grabbed Loki and pushed him towards his chest as the blade sticking out of Kurse's chest then pierced Loki's solar plexus, mortally wounding him while Thor could only look on helplessly and cry out for his own brother who was then dismissively thrown down onto the ground by Kurse.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor holds \nLoki\n as he \"dies\" in his arms\n \n \nDespite being mortally wounded and facing a seemingly unstoppable beast, Loki got the last laugh as he managed to press one of Kurse's \nBlack Hole Grenades\n and said he would see the monster in \nHel\n. Kurse was then killed in the ensuing explosion as his own body was crushed and Thor ran to Loki's aid. As Thor promised to tell \nOdin\n of his heroic deeds, Loki said he had not done them for Odin and then seemingly died in Thor's arms, much to his sadness.\n[\n9\n]\nReturn to Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to comfort \nJane Foster\n \n \n\"Amplifying the weapon's impact.

Thor comforted her that it was not her fault, but was interrupted when \nRichard Madison\n called her on her phone, which seemed to be impossible as she and Madison were separated between realms.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nJane Foster\n return to \nLondon\n \n \nAmazed that Madison was calling her all the way from \nEarth\n, Foster began exploring the cave for answers while Thor was embarrassed that she was talking to another man. Before long, Foster discovered all the objects that did not come back when she was playing and experimenting with the \nConvergence\n at the storage house. This allowed them to find a \nportal\n to \nLondon\n where her car was waiting, as Thor then questioned who exactly Madison was.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is reunited with Doctor \nErik Selvig\n \n \nThey quickly drove back to the \napartment\n in London where Foster was greeted by \nDarcy Lewis\n and \nIan Boothby\n while Thor carefully placed \nMjlnir\n onto the coat rack. \nErik Selvig\n then came over and greeted Thor, who noted Selvig was not wearing pants at the time, which Boothby claimed helped him to think. Selvig then asked if \nLoki\n was also with him, but Thor then noted that Loki had been killed by \nKurse\n earlier, which seemed to greatly please Selvig. Thor was not pleased to hear this but understood that Selvig had been put in this state by Loki.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor works out a plan to defeat \nMalekith\n \n \nThe group then stood around a table and discussed \nMalekith\n's plans for the Aether, and how he intended to use its power to destroy all the \nNine Realms\n and plunge the \nMultiverse\n into eternal darkness. Thor noted that for this to work, Malekith needed to be in a specific location which Selvig realized was in \nGreenwich\n in London. Seeking to destroy the \nDark Elves\n, Thor reclaimed Mjlnir while Selvig then went to put his pants back on as they prepared to leave.\n[\n9\n]\nBattle of Greenwich\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor confronting \nMalekith\n within Greenwich\n \n \n\"You know with all that \npower\n... I thought you'd hit harder.\"\nThor to \nMalekith\n[src]\nWhile the \nConvergence\n had just finally begun to spread and all of the worlds within the \nNine Realms\n were almost in line, Thor's allies put \nGravimetric Spikes\n around the area ready to disrupt the Convergence as much as possible until \nMalekith\n also arrived alongside his army, smashing through the \nRoyal Naval College\n. Thor landed before Malekith's \nArk\n and the pair faced each other on the battleground, while Malekith told him he should not have come so far as he would soon die regardless.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor blocking some of the \nAether\n's power\n \n \nThe two mortal enemies exchanged threats, as Malekith promised to destroy \nAsgard\n once he was finished with \nEarth\n, before Malekith attempted to kill Thor with the \nAether\n's power. Thor was able to use \nMjlnir\n to deflect the attacks, despite being knocked back by the sheer force of the \nInfinity Stone\n. Thor soon recovered and mocked Malekith's lack of strength, telling him he expected more, before then knocking him back with a powerful hit from Mjlnir.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor uses \nMjlnir\n to attack \nMalekith\n \n \nThe \nAsgardian\n and the Dark Elf began to fight as Thor attempted to use the power of Mjlnir to destroy his foe, only to discover that the Aether had given Malekith incredible strength and durability, allowing him to absorb blows from the hammer and fire them back. The \nbattle\n caused them to be pushed through all the Convergence's \nportals\n, although throughout the battle they were both equally matched in strength which meant neither could have killed the other while they fought.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor loses \nMjlnir\n while on \nSvartalfheim\n \n \nThe \nDark Elves\n began to invade Greenwich but \nErik Selvig\n's devices teleported some of them away, stopping the Dark Elves' army from defeating the \nhumans\n and allowing Malekith to ensure his own plans to take control of the Nine Realms come true. As they had continued fighting, Thor and Malekith crash landed in \nSvartalfheim\n where Thor attempted to Mjlnir at Malekith, only to then lose it through a portal, leaving him near defenseless from Malekith's attacks.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nMalekith\n both fall down a building\n \n \nThe Dark Elf proceeded to take full advantage of Thor losing his main weapon, knocking him back with the full force of the Aether before standing over the injured Thor as they both then fell through another portal, crash landing onto \nThe Gherkin\n when they returned to Earth with some force. While falling off the side of the Gherkin, Thor then attempted to draw Mjlnir back into his hand, but he was too late as he fell through another portal while he was still fighting Malekith.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is then teleported onto \nJotunheim\n \n \nWhile his hammer was then forced to fly through space as fast as it possibly could to try in its determined quest to reach him, Thor and Malekith had then landed on \nJotunheim\n they were both immediately almost killed by a \nFrost Beast\n which launched out of a cave and destroyed the section of a mountain they were stood on, causing them to fall through yet another portal with the Beast as well, which had also trapped the Beast on Earth where it attacked the Elves.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor takes the train back to the battlefield\n \n \nHaving gotten away from the Frost Beast which saved \nDarcy Lewis\n and \nIan Boothby\n from Dark Elves, Thor and Malekith were teleported to separate parts of \nLondon\n, as Thor was forced to use the London Underground System to make his way back towards Greenwich. Thor quickly asked the highly confused passengers the best way for him to get back to the battle, and smiling to himself when an attractive woman had then awkwardly fallen on him.\n[\n9\n]\nDestroying Malekith\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finds \nJane Foster\n and \nErik Selvig\n \n \n\"I've come to accept your surrender.\"\n\"You think you can stop this? The \nAether\n cannot be destroyed.\"\n\"But you can.\"\nThor and \nMalekith\n[src]\nNow that \nMalekith\n was back on \nEarth\n and next to the \nArk\n, he then started to release the \nAether\n's power into the \nNine Realms\n through the \nConvergence\n. Thor returned to Greenwich and regrouped with \nJane Foster\n and Selvig as they all watched as the Aether's power was being unleashed. They told him that neither of them could get close to Malekith as the Aether would have torn their bodies apart, but Thor could, so he took the \nGravimetric Spikes\n and had then moved forward.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor demands \nMalekith\n to surrender\n \n \nWith the Spikes in his hands, Thor moved through the Aether and found Malekith in the center, pushing it's power through the Nine Realms and plunging them into eternal darkness. Thor called out to Malekith, telling him he was there to accept his surrender, as he had said to the \nKronan Stone Man\n, and threw the Spikes into Malekith's arms, teleporting them to \nSvartalfheim\n, although Malekith merely used the Aether's power to regrow his own arms back.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to finally destroy \nMalekith\n \n \nFueled by the Aether, Malekith told Thor that he now could not be stopped, and the Aether could not be destroyed, only for Thor to note that Malekith himself could be destroyed before charging forward. Powered by a desire to avenge the \nSacking of Asgard\n and the death of \nFrigga\n as well as \nLoki\n, Thor then reclaimed \nMjlnir\n and struck the last Spike into Malekith's chest, knocking him back into the Ark with incredible force and teleporting him onto Svartalfheim.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is saved just in time by \nErik Selvig\n \n \nWhile the threat of Malekith was temporally over, the impact of the blast combined with the Aether, knocked Thor unconscious. As Foster ran to his aid, Malekith's ship started to fall down towards their heads, with Foster unable to pull Thor to safety. Fortunately, \nErik Selvig\n's devices teleported the ship away and it crashed down on Malekith, finally killing him. Meanwhile, Thor awoke to find he had succeeded in defeating Malekith and all the Dark Elves.\n[\n9\n]\nRejecting the Throne\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor taking down his knee before King \nOdin\n \n \n\"I will protect \nAsgard\n and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair.

I would rather be a good man than a great king.\"\nThor to \"\nOdin\n\"\n[src]\nWith \nMalekith\n and the \nDark Elves\n now finally defeated, Thor returned onto \nAsgard\n and talked with \nOdin\n about the recent events. He spoke about \nLoki\n's sacrifice and how he now believed his brother had died a hero by sacrificing himself to kill \nKurse\n. He then explained his desire to return to \nEarth\n and be with \nJane Foster\n, and had then renounced his claim to the throne of Asgard.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor leaves Asgard to return to back \nEarth\n \n \nStill promising to protect the \nNine Realms\n from any future dangers with his last and every breath, Thor noted how the sacrifices of such a life changed the man who would become the king. Seeking to then make a statement, Thor then offered Odin \nMjlnir\n which he refused before wishing Thor good luck in his new search for love with Foster. Unknown to him, Loki was still alive as he sat down on the throne, masquerading as Odin. Thor then returned to Earth and reunited back with Foster.\n[\n9\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nJane Foster\n reunite again\n \n \nSoon after the battles, when \nPhil Coulson\n and his \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \nteam\n were investigating the discovery of a lost Asgardian artifact known as the \nBerserker Staff\n, he sought to consult with Thor, but was informed by \nNick Fury\n that Thor had taken himself \"off the grid.\"\n[\n27\n]\n Coulson told \nSif\n, when she came to Earth chasing \nLorelei\n, not to inform Thor of his survival and that it would have been better if he told Thor himself that he was still alive.\n[\n28\n]\nAvengers Reassembled\n[\n]\nDeeply in Love\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nJane Foster\n rollerblade together\n \n \n\"\nShe\n's incredible, isn't she, Mjlnir?

Both Thor and Foster taught the other things about their respective worlds, and continued to fall deeper in love with each other.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tells \nMjlnir\n to protect \nJane Foster\n \n \nOne night after a costume party, as Thor watched Foster while she slept, he made a promise with \nMjlnir\n so that it would always protect her. Thor set his sights for a future with Foster, including the idea of having children. But, as he furthered those thoughts on a future with the love of his life, Thor began to fear losing that future with Foster, mainly due to her being a mortal. Due to this fear, Thor started to distance himself from Foster with his other duties, including Avengers missions from \nNick Fury\n.\n[\n2\n]\nBattle of Sudan\n[\n]\n\"Thor got busy saving humanity.\"\n\nKorg\n[src]\nWith the rising threat of \nHYDRA\n, the Avengers were officially reassembled, using the \nAvengers Tower\n as their headquarters to embark on several missions to ruin HYDRA's plans for world domination.\n[\n29\n]\n Thor was with \nJane Foster\n at the University of London, as he was informed by \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n that the \nAvengers\n were reunited to assist \nBlack Widow\n in a situation in \nSudan\n.

While searching for the Scepter in the \nHYDRA Research Base\n, Thor and the Avengers battled countless HYDRA operatives who had highly advanced weapons and armor designed from \nChitauri\n technology gathered from the \nBattle of New York\n. When \nIron Man\n discovered that the base was protected by an energy shield, Thor noted that HYDRA would not have built such powerful technology and defenses without the use of the Scepter's incredible alien power.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor agrees to leave and rescue \nHawkeye\n \n \nThe Avengers were soon attacked by \nPietro\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n, who had gained powers from HYDRA's experiments. \nHawkeye\n was injured during this attack and Thor offered to get him back to safety. Thor and \nCaptain America\n used their combined strength to destroy a \nHYDRA Tank\n before Thor saved Hawkeye. Eventually, the Avengers located the Scepter, captured \nBaron Strucker\n and HYDRA was finally defeated, although the Maximoff twins escaped.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tells \nBruce Banner\n of Hulk's violence\n \n \nOnce the team was back on the \nQuinjet\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n asked Thor for an assessment of \nBruce Banner\n's skills on the battlefield to help him calm down; however, the overly excited Thor commented on how \nHulk\n's violence had just resulted in the deaths of dozens of HYDRA soldiers who were now screaming in \nHel\n. Seeing that this upset Banner, Thor took back his words and told him that many of the injuries he had inflicted on the soldiers were nonfatal.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor agrees to give \nTony Stark\n the \nScepter\n \n \nWhile they looked at the Scepter and discussed how they had been hunting it ever since the \nHYDRA Uprising\n and how \nList\n had used it to make enhanced soldiers, Stark asked Thor to allow him to analyze the Scepter before Thor took it back to \nAsgard\n and, seeing no real threat there, Thor agreed. Stark then suggested that the Avengers hold a party at \nAvengers Tower\n to celebrate their victory over Baron Strucker to which both Thor and \nSteve Rogers\n agreed.\n[\n29\n]\nAvengers Celebration\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nStark\n compares their girlfriends\n \n \n\"The \nhandle\n's imprinted, right?

You're all not worthy.\"\n\nTony Stark\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor attended a party at \nAvengers Tower\n to celebrate their victory over \nHYDRA\n and the capture of the \nScepter\n. Thor listened to \nJames Rhodes\n' unimpressive war stories about lifting a tank and joked with \nTony Stark\n about whether \nJane Foster\n was a more impressive girlfriend than \nPepper Potts\n, comparing their careers much to \nMaria Hill\n's amusement.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor drinks with \nSteve Rogers\n in a party\n \n \nLater, Thor decided to drink an \nAsgardian\n drink he brought with him, stating it had been aged thousands of years to perfect the taste. He shared some with \nSteve Rogers\n, who was unable to get drunk from any alcohol on earth due to the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n boosting his immune system. An \nold veteran\n demanded a taste of the liquor, but Thor warned that no normal man could handle the drink. Despite Thor's warnings, the man insisted that he was strong enough due to his time in \nWorld War II\n, and was later escorted home, barely able to stand. Thor then remained at the party while many of the other guests left it.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses Rogers almost lift \nMjlnir\n \n \nWith the party over, the \nAvengers\n sat and drank as Thor was challenged on the legitimacy of \nMjlnir\n by \nClint Barton\n, who thought it could be lifted by anyone. Thor then invited Barton to try and lift it, so he accepted, but ultimately failed. The others then also attempted to lift Mjlnir, including \nTony Stark\n with the help of \nJames Rhodes\n and their gauntlets, as well as \nBruce Banner\n who pretending to Hulk out.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor jokingly calls his \nteammates\n unworthy\n \n \nOnly \nSteve Rogers\n was able to move Mjlnir slightly, which made Thor nervous, but Rogers soon admitted defeat,\n[\n29\n]\n although, from then on, Thor remained suspicious of him being worthy, which he actually was.\n[\n22\n]\n Stark claimed that the hammer was actually imprinted and it was not \nAsgardian\n magic that held the key. When all the Avengers who had attempted had failed, Thor implied that it was simply because they were actually unworthy, much to everyone's disgust while they all still laughed together.\n[\n29\n]\nUltron Offensive\n[\n]\nAttack on Avengers Tower\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nUltron\n's damaged body\n \n \n\"Down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.\"\n\"Who sent you?\"\n\nUltron\n and Thor\n[src]\nSuddenly, a loud noise rang in the team's ear as they were greeted by a heavily damaged \nIron Legion\n drone then accused them all of being killers. The robot claimed that while awakening from sleep, it had killed \nsomebody\n, but when \nSteve Rogers\n questioned who, the robot did not answer. When Thor asked the drone who sent him, the robot only replied by replaying an audio tape of something \nTony Stark\n had said revealing himself as \nUltron\n, an artificial intelligent android created by Stark with \nBruce Banner\n's help, designed to safeguard all of humanity.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles the \nUltron Sentries\n \n \nUltron told the \nAvengers\n that he was on a mission to bring peace and then attacked the entire group using the Iron Legion which he had reprogrammed to be his own army of \nUltron Sentries\n. The Avengers battled against the army, with Thor using his strength to rip apart the robots with his bare hands. In the ensuing conflict, one of the drones stole the \nScepter\n and flew away from \nAvengers Tower\n before any of the team could stop it from getting away from them.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor destroys \nUltron\n's first main body\n \n \nEventually, the drones were all destroyed by the combined efforts of the Avengers, with Ultron commenting that it had been a dramatic, few moments. When Ultron told them that the only way to ensure peace was to destroy the Avengers, Thor then responded by angrily throwing \nMjlnir\n at the robot, destroying his body only for Ultron to download his body to \nanother area\n while singing a song from \nPinocchio\n as his current body then shut down.\n[\n29\n]\nArgument\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor angrily confronting \nTony Stark\n \n \n\"This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with \nsomething\n you don't understand.\"\nThor to \nTony Stark\n[src]\nWhile the \nAvengers\n regrouped and tried to figure out their next move, Thor was sent after the \nIron Legion\n robot who had escaped with the \nScepter\n, although Thor was unable to follow it too far and had only learned it was going north. Having returned to \nAvengers Tower\n, the now infuriated Thor grabbed \nTony Stark\n by the throat blaming him for the mess, before being calmed down by \nSteve Rogers\n who then demanded an update on what Thor had learned.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor questions how they'll find \nUltron\n \n \nThor noted that now he could no longer return the Scepter back to \nAsgard\n as was planned, blaming Stark for creating \nUltron\n, noting that the entire situation could have been avoided if he had not toyed with the power of the Scepter, an object unknown to him. Stark defended his decision to create the robotic A.I. by claiming that while they could deal with forces such as \nHYDRA\n and arms dealers with ease, beings like the \nChitauri\n were beyond all their own powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nAvengers\n discuss \nUlysses Klaue\n \n \nSeeking to work out where Ultron would have gone, the Avengers soon learned that \nBaron Strucker\n had been killed by the robot and so they began researching what Strucker may have told him. Eventually, they came to the conclusion that Ultron would be seeking out \nUlysses Klaue\n, who could have sold him \nvibranium\n. Looking at his picture, Thor noted that Klaue had a brand burned onto his neck written in \nWakandan\n which showed him to be a thief.\n[\n29\n]\nBattle at the Salvage Yard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to find peace with \nUltron\n \n \n\"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.\"\n\"I think you're confusing peace with quiet.\"\nThor and \nUltron\n[src]\nThe \nAvengers\n eventually managed to locate \nUltron\n purchasing a new supply of \nvibranium\n from \nUlysses Klaue\n while within the city of \nJohannesburg\n. The Avengers arrived just as Ultron attacked Klaue after being insulted. Thor and the other Avengers confronted Ultron and his companions, \nWanda\n and \nPietro Maximoff\n. Thor spoke with Ultron, trying to convince him to be peaceful but was ignored.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor destroys an \nUltron Sentry\n \n \nDespite all their attempts to resolve the conflict, it soon became clear that Ultron had no intention of keeping the peace, the teams began fighting, with \nHawkeye\n and \nBlack Widow\n fighting all Klaue's soldiers while the others battled the \nUltron Sentries\n. While Ultron fought against \nIron Man\n, Thor assisted \nCaptain America\n in the battle against the robots and Maximoffs, using teamwork to gain the upper hand and soon destroyed Ultron's small robotic army.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is given a vision by \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nAs their battle neared its end and the \nAvengers\n seemed victorious, Wanda Maximoff snuck up behind Thor and used her own abilities to warp his mind before attacking all the other Avengers. Although he initially believed he was too mighty to be affected and warned his other teammates, Thor soon seemingly found himself in \nAsgard\n, at which point he realized Maximoff's power was stronger than he had anticipated as it had managed to affect his own mind.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor has a vision of \nAsgard\n's destruction\n \n \nThor continued to suffer from visions of the citizens of Asgard dying in some kind of a war which seemed to involve the \nInfinity Stones\n. He was confronted by the ghostly figure of \nHeimdall\n who blamed him for killing them all while a mysterious \nhooded figure\n watched while Thor fired bolts of destructive lightning from his body, getting flashes of the creation of \nVision\n and the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n which would one day house all of the Infinity Stones and bring destruction.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor considers \nWanda Maximoff\n's vision\n \n \nStill suffering from the effects along with the rest of the team, Thor was forced to make a quick escape to the \nQuinjet\n to recover his mind while Iron Man was forced to stop \nHulk\n's current destructive \nrampage\n through Johannesburg, as \nBruce Banner\n was also affected by Maximoff's powers. While on board the Quinjet, the unaffected Barton updated \nMaria Hill\n and explained he would take the team \nsomewhere\n safe where they could all recover.\n[\n29\n]\nWater of Sight\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nRogers\n at \nClint Barton's home\n \n \n\"I need your help.\"\n\"It's nice to be needed.\"\n\"This may be dangerous.\"\n\"I would be disappointed if it wasn't.\"\nThor and \nErik Selvig\n[src]\nIn order to get the \nAvengers\n out of harm's way, \nClint Barton\n piloted the \nQuinjet\n to a remote location. With Thor, \nCaptain America\n and \nBlack Widow\n suffering from visions and \nTony Stark\n and \nBruce Banner\n recovering from a \nmassive fight\n they had had right in the center of \nJohannesburg\n, Barton flew the Quinjet to the only place he knew they would all be safe; \nhis home\n. Barton then introduced all the Avengers to his family, including his pregnant wife \nLaura Barton\n and their two children.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor leaves to find the answers in his vision\n \n \nWhile Barton was explaining how he had asked \nNick Fury\n to keep the location of the farm off all of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's official records, Thor then accidentally stepped on one of the \nCooper Barton\n's toys and hid the broken pieces under the table. Still struggling with the vision \nWanda Maximoff\n had given him, Thor chose not to stay at the house and then informed Rogers and Stark that he would go to learn more about the \nInfinity Stones\n and the \nbeing\n he had seen in his vision.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor asks for Doctor \nErik Selvig\n's help\n \n \nWanting not to draw any attention to himself, Thor put on a hooded jacket and found Doctor \nErik Selvig\n outside the \nUniversity of London\n where he was currently teaching. Greeting Selvig beside his car, Thor asked for his assistance for finding the \nWater of Sight\n. Selvig happily agreed despite Thor's warnings that it could have proven to be dangerous, with Selvig noting that he would be disappointed if the mission was not dangerous as he got into the car.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and Selvig arrive at the \nWater of Sight\n \n \nUpon finding the Water of Sight with Selvig's help, Thor explained that throughout the \nNine Realms\n there were reflections and, if he was accepted by the water gods, then he would have been able to return to his dream and find the answers he needed, although Selvig warned that none of the stories involving this place ended well. Despite all the warnings, Thor undressed and entered the pool and the water spirits allowed him to revisit his previous nightmare in more detail.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor gets a new vision in the \nWater of Sight\n \n \nThor's body was taken over by the water spirits who claimed only a human sacrifice would stop \nUltron\n and noting that the \nScepter\n would be key.\n[\n32\n]\n Thor became engulfed with lightning and saw nightmarish visions of the destruction of \nAsgard\n and the deaths of all of his close friends including \nHeimdall\n. He also saw strange visions of the \nInfinity Stones\n and the birth of a \nnew being\n which could have helped them destroy Ultron.

This led to a fight between the team. As this was happening, Thor arrived and cast a bolt of lightning at the machine that contained the android. The android, now sentient, released himself from the container, knocking Thor back with incredible force.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses \nVision\n coming to life\n \n \nConfused about his surroundings in \nAvengers Tower\n as he glanced all around, the being's gaze immediately focused on Thor. He leaped towards him, planning to attack. Thor was able to counter by tossing him out a glass window, but the being was able to stop himself in mid-air as he looked out at \nNew York City\n. The being then took the time to examine himself on the reflection of the glass window while also gazing out into the city, considering what happened.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explains why he helped make \nVision\n \n \nWhile Thor stopped all of the \nAvengers\n from attacking it, the being apologized for its own actions and then offered his gratitude to Thor before taking a similar appearance to the God of Thunder's outfit, mainly the cape and gauntlets. Thor explained that he witnessed a vision where the \nEarth\n would be destroyed, given to him by \nWanda Maximoff\n, and at the center of it was the \nInfinity Stones\n, including the Mind Stone, which was implanted on the android's forehead.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nVision\n discuss stopping \nUltron\n \n \nDespite what Thor said, \nCaptain America\n, confused as to why the android sounded like J.A.R.V.I.S., allowed \nTony Stark\n to explain that he reconfigured his matrix to create \"something new.\" The android, eventually going by the name of \nVision\n, stated that he was not a child of \nUltron\n, Ultron himself or \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n; he was his own entity entirely who was there to assist them in finding a way of stopping Ultron's evil plans to soon destroy the entire human race.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is handed back \nMjlnir\n by \nVision\n \n \nThe Avengers, along with the Maximoff twins, remained skeptical as to which side Vision was on; the android explained that he was on the side of life while \nUltron\n was not, and then went on to say that Ultron was currently waiting for all of the Avengers, especially his own creator \nTony Stark\n, in \nSokovia\n. He also stated that Ultron wanted to spread his rage across the globe before handing \nMjlnir\n back to Thor, much to the bewilderment of everyone in the room.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks with \nVision\n before the mission\n \n \nAs they all prepared for the incoming \nBattle of Sokovia\n, Thor took some time to speak with Vision while all of the other Avengers collected their gear and regrouped on board the \nQuinjet\n to fly to Ultron's location at \nNovi Grad\n. During the flight, Captain America gave a speech in which he told his fellow Avengers that their priority was be to get the people of Sokovia to safety before battling all the \nUltron Sentries\n that were going to be standing in their way.\n[\n29\n]\nBattle of Sokovia\n[\n]\nBattling the Ultron Sentries\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses \nUltron\n attacking \nSokovia\n \n \n\"I am Thor, son of \nOdin\n, and as long as there is life in my breast, I... am... running out of things to say!\"\nThor to \nUltron\n[src]\nThor joined the rest of the \nAvengers\n going to \nSokovia\n, while \nCaptain America\n organized the evacuation of all of the civilians before any fighting could have put them at risk.

Thor assisted \nCaptain America\n when he attempted to save a woman in a car from falling to her death, as she became trapped on the edge of the city when it into the sky.

At the same time, Thor managed to grab another falling car and drop it back onto the city.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles against all the \nUltron Sentries\n \n \nTeaming up with Captain America, they both used Thor's hammer to send \nCaptain America's Shield\n flying into a horde of the Ultron Sentries, destroying several of them. Thor grabbed another of the Sentries and flew him into the air, before spinning and knocking several more out of the sky and smashing them apart, causing one to crash land into a petrol van and cause a massive fireball which then destroyed even more of the enemy machines.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is beaten into submission by \nUltron\n \n \nAs the battle against the \nUltron Sentries\n became more intense, Thor was proving himself the superior fighter until he was then attacked by \nUltron\n himself, who now with his new \nvibranium\n body, the metal warmonger then proceeded to beat the God of Thunder into submission, eventually causing him to drop \nMjlnir\n. Ultron proceeded to use his Gravity Manipulation capabilities to launch large stone pillars at Thor repeatedly to gain the upper hand in their battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is beaten and strangled by \nUltron\n \n \nHowever, noticing that \nVision\n had arrived, Thor distracted Ultron with an overdrawn speech claiming that as the first son of \nOdin\n and also prince of \nAsgard\n he would never surrender, before Vision then used Mjlnir to hit Ultron out of the church with incredible force, allowing Thor to get back on his feet. Vision then handed the hammer back to Thor and they briefly discussed its great balance, with Thor noting that this helped him get a better swing from the hammer.\n[\n29\n]\nProtecting the Key\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor shouts toward \nUltron\n \n \n\"Is that the best you can do?\"\n\"You had to ask.\"\n\"\nThis\n is the best I can do.

As Ultron hovered above them, Thor roared at him, asking if this was the best of his abolities.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles against \nUltron\n's entire army\n \n \nUltron responded by unleashing his entire army of \nUltron Sentries\n to attack the Avengers, much to \nCaptain America\n's annoyance before they prepared for their last stand. Ultron sent in his army and the Avengers put all their might into keeping him away from the key, ripping apart hundreds of his clones in the ensuing battle, with Thor summoning lightning from \nMjlnir\n to blast the robots apart.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor almost destroys \nUltron\n's armored body\n \n \nAs the \nAvengers\n gained the upper hand in the battle against the seemingly never-ending army of \nUltron Sentries\n, Ultron himself was knocked outside and Thor joined \nVision\n and \nIron Man\n in using his lightning and energy blasts to damage and melt Ultron's \nVibranium\n armor.

As they watched the people taken to safety, \nIron Man\n worked out a plan to destroy the city, at the risk of his and Thor's deaths, but neither showed any hesitation if it meant stopping \nUltron\n's plans to kill all life on Earth.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and Rogers are both shot at by \nUltron\n \n \nWithout warning, Ultron fired a barrage of bullets at the pair from the \nQuinjet\n he had stolen, as both Thor and Captain America shielded themselves from the bullets. Ultron then turned his sights towards \nHawkeye\n, who was attempting to save \nCostel\n from harm. before the other Avengers could stop him, Ultron killed \nQuicksilver\n by shooting him, as he had run in front of Hawkeye to protect him. Thor then charged forward to finally complete their mission plan.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor uses his lightning to destroy the Key\n \n \nIn a final desperate attempt to destroy all human life, \nUltron\n finally managed to activate the key and began the process of dropping \nNovi Grad\n onto Earth. With seemingly no other alternative, Thor and \nIron Man\n flew into the machine itself and in an attempt to destroy it. Iron Man capped the internal engine to double back the energy wave going to be unleashed, as Thor held \nMjlnir\n over the key, charging it with lightning and waited until Iron Man gave him the order.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor survives the destruction of \nSokovia\n \n \nOnce Iron Man had used his \nArc Reactor\n beam to overheat the city's core, Thor then smashed his hammer onto the key, channeling the massive amounts of lightning into the \nvibranium\n causing a massive smite that vaporized the entire city before it could hit the ground, saving billions of lives in the process.

Telling Stark and Rogers that he would eventually return, Thor called \nHeimdall\n to summon the \nBifrost Bridge\n and returned to \nAsgard\n to begin his mission, leaving before Stark complained about how these gateways he created ruined their facility's lawn by burning a lot of it.\n[\n29\n]\nBreakup with Jane Foster\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nJane Foster\n begin to drift apart\n \n \n\"\nJane\n wrote a note.

Eventually, Thor returned to an empty home, where he discovered a note left by Foster. He read it which revealed that she had broken up with him, leaving him in a state of sadness as he sat alone in their home. Distraught by this information, Thor convinced himself that their breakup was mutual, despite that not being the case.\n[\n2\n]\nFutile Search\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is captured and held in \nMuspelheim\n \n \n\"I'm a bit of a hero.

During this time, Thor had begun to have dreams of \nAsgard\n up in flames with the Fire Demon \nSurtur\n at the center of all the destruction, prompting the God of Thunder to travel to \nMuspelheim\n, where he had then allowed himself to be captured by Surtur in his search for an explanation for all of these horrific dreams of Asgard's destruction.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is chained up and taken before \nSurtur\n \n \nHaving recounted his life story to a skeleton who was sharing his cell, Thor was granted an audience with Surtur himself, as Thor was then dropped from his cell and left dangling by a chain before the lord of the \nFire Demons\n. While Thor noted that he thought \nOdin\n had killed Surtur half a million years ago, Surtur explained that he could not die until he had \ndestroyed\n Asgard, to which Thor then explained his dreams of seeing Asgard up in flames at the hands of Surtur.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns \nSurtur\n's plan\n \n \nSurtur explained that these were visions of \nRagnark\n, promising Thor that once his \nCrown of Black Fire\n had then finally been reunited back with the \nEternal Flame\n then he could have been able to destroy all of Asgard, although Thor kept interrupting Surtur as his chain spun him around. In trading banter with the Fire Demon over his schemes of destruction and his crown, Thor had also learned from Surtur that Thor's father Odin was no longer on Asgard, confirming his fears that something was wrong.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles against the \nFire Demons\n \n \nOnce he got Surtur to foolishly reveal his own schemes, Thor then continued mocking him before summoning \nMjlnir\n and easily busted out of his chains, although he struggled to get his timing quite right. While Surtur insisted that Thor had made a terrible mistake in coming into \nMuspelheim\n in the first place to challenge him, Thor still just confidently insisted that he made terrible mistakes constantly, yet they always seemed to work out in his own favor in the long run.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting against \nSurtur\n \n \nDespite the seemingly overwhelming hordes of the Fire Demons that were sent to destroy him, Thor's \nAsgardian\n strength combined with the power of Mjlnir had given him a clear advantage in the ensuing battle. In the ensuing \nbattle\n, Thor used Mjlnir to destroy Surtur's demons before blocking an attack from the \nTwilight Sword\n.

Once arriving there, Thor discovered that \nSkurge\n, who had previously fought alongside Thor during the \nBattle of Vanaheim\n, had recently been named the new guardian of the Bifrost.

While they were discussing how Loki had survived being killed by \nKurse\n, they were interrupted by women who wanted a picture with Thor, as one woman expressed her sadness that \nJane Foster\n had dumped him, although Thor insisted it was a mutual dumping.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses \nLoki\n falling through a \nportal\n \n \nWhile they were speaking, with Thor jokingly comparing Loki's outfit to that of a witch, they noticed something was happening under their feet, which Loki insisted he had nothing to do with. Before they could react, Loki was suddenly captured by a \nportal\n on the floor which then left behind nothing but a business card with an address for the \nNew York Sanctum\n, which Thor then headed straight to in order to locate his brother and understand what had just happened to Loki.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being introduced to \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nUpon knocking on the door of the Sanctum, Thor found that he was immediately teleported inside the building where he began looking around.

Hela then calmly ordered both Thor and Loki to kneel before her as their new Queen of \nAsgard\n. However, Thor had refused to recognize her as the heir to the throne and, seeking to end the fight before it started, proceeded to throw \nMjlnir\n towards her. However, much to Thor's complete horror, Hela caught Mjlnir in her hand and then proceeded to completely destroy the hammer with ease.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempting to battle against \nHela\n \n \nAs Hela armed herself with \nNecroswords\n and prepared to attack the brothers, Loki panicked and called for the \nBifrost Bridge\n.

Grandmaster, however, revealed that he meant Carlo was pardoned from life before using the \nMelt Stick\n to kill him, as Thor looked on in utter horror as Carlo screamed while melting down into nothing but slime.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is reunited with \nLoki\n on \nSakaar\n \n \nWhile Grandmaster properly introduced himself and explained the Contest of Champions, Thor insisted he would not be a part of it and would be returning to \nAsgard\n. However, due to the unusual relativistic effects of how they got there, Thor discovered that \nLoki\n was still alive following the fight with \nHela\n within the \nBifrost Bridge\n and had already been there for several weeks, earning Grandmaster's favor while there, much to Thor's considerable confusion and annoyance.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns of \nGrandmaster\n's \nchampion\n \n \nGrandmaster questioned Loki over his relationship to Thor, to which Loki insisted that he had never met him before, and insisting he was adopted when Thor admitted they were brothers. As Thor continued to threaten Grandmaster for his own freedom, he then was told that the only way he could have his freedom was if he \ndefeated\n the Contest of Champions' \nultimate champion\n, which Thor was confident he could do before being taken away to his cell by Grandmaster.\n[\n5\n]\nContest of Champions\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being introduced to \nKorg\n and \nMiek\n \n \n\"You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped \nOdin\n of his power, stranded him on \nEarth\n... to die, releasing the \nGoddess of Death\n.

As Thor questioned how Korg how wound up becoming one of \nGrandmaster\n's warriors, Korg then explained it was down to a failed revolution while Thor also discovered that their cell was an endless circle which he could not escape from.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nKorg\n discuss the upcoming battle\n \n \nWhile Thor and Korg discussed how \nSakaar\n was a place that did not make sense, Thor then questioned if anybody had ever fought Grandmaster's \nultimate champion\n, to which Korg pointed out that only \nDoug\n had, and died. Korg then questioned if Thor intended to fight Grandmaster's champion, to which he insisted he would and he would win, as Korg noted that Doug used to say the same thing before being killed, calling Thor the new Doug.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prays for \nOdin\n's journey to \nValhalla\n \n \nWhile still locked within the cell, Thor sat alone and prayed for \nOdin\n to have a safe journey to \nValhalla\n. During his prayers, Thor was visited by \nLoki\n, who had commented that he understood how much it hurt to discover that his own family had been lying to him his entire life, ever since Loki discovered he was actually a \nFrost Giant\n. Thor's only response to seeing Loki was to throw stones at him, unsurprised to discover that Loki had sent down another projection of himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is visited inside his prison cell by \nLoki\n \n \nLoki suggested to Thor that they win Grandmaster's trust until they killed him and ruled over Sakaar together, although Thor clearly did not approve. Seeing that Thor had other plans, Loki reminded him of how \nHela\n had destroyed \nMjlnir\n with ease and proved herself to be vastly more powerful than both of them, only for Thor to accuse Loki of killing their father and allowing Hela to take power. Loki then left, with Korg and Miek telling him to piss off once he left.\n[\n5\n]\nFight Preparation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nKorg\n choosing weapons for battles\n \n \n\"By \nOdin\n's beard, you shall not cut my hair, lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

Korg summarized that Thor had a special relationship with Mjlnir and that its destruction was similar to losing a loved one.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempting to speak with \nValkyrie\n \n \nStill struggling to pick a weapon, as he attempted to throw a hammer and was disappointed when it did not return to his hand, Thor then spotted the \ndrunk woman\n who had captured him. Speaking to Korg about her, Korg revealed that she was actually \nAsgardian\n, much to Thor's great surprise.

While Thor gushed about his admiration of the Valkyrie and how he had always wanted to join them before learning they were only women, Thor then informed Valkyrie of the threat of \nHela\n to \nAsgard\n and had requested her help in stopping her. When she was unsympathetic to the plight of Asgard, he called her a coward before being forced to go out and fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor's hair is cut off before his battle\n \n \nHaving once again been incapacitated from the Obedience Disks, Thor underwent final preparations for his final battle against the champion. Moments before going out to fight the champion, Thor then had his hair cut by \nsomeone\n strangely familiar, who ignored Thor's desperate pleas for his beloved hair not to be cut off. Thor was then given \nDoug\n's \nmace and shield\n, a pair of \nretractable swords\n and a \ncollapsible helmet\n for his battle the champion.\n[\n5\n]\nDuel with Hulk\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor stepping into the arena for his battle\n \n \n\"Where have you been?

While the audience continued cheering, \nGrandmaster\n introduced Thor as the Lord of Thunder while his champion prepared to arrive.

Thor became completely overjoyed at seeing his former \nAvengers\n teammate, calling out to both \nLoki\n and Grandmaster as he called Hulk a friend from work. Thor then attempted to talk with Hulk, explaining \nMjlnir\n's destruction and Loki being alive and tried to negotiate with Hulk, but Thor made the mistake of calling him \nBruce Banner\n which angered Hulk.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is forced to battle against \nHulk\n \n \nTo Thor's great surprise, Hulk insisted that there was no Banner but only Hulk and \nfuriously attacked\n Thor. He then quickly defended himself and the two fought inside the arena, with Hulk smashing Thor with his \nSakaaran War Hammer\n, sending Thor flying backwards as he lost his Mace. Annoyed at being attacked, Thor drew his \nswords\n and attempted to get through to Banner, insisting that they were friends, but Hulk refused to listen to him and attacked.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is smashed through the wall by \nHulk\n \n \nHulk soon managed to gain the upper hand in their clash as he broke Thor's swords and kicked him across the arena, smashing Thor into a wall, much to the delight of \nGrandmaster\n. Thor was just able to free himself as Hulk then launched one of his massive hammers towards him, before charging towards Thor armed with his axe. Thor, however, responded by ripping the hammer from the wall and striking Hulk with it at full force, sending him flying back.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempting to calm down \nHulk\n \n \nWhile everybody in the arena watching the fight froze in shock at the blow, including \nKorg\n and \nMiek\n, Thor calmly made his way towards the now injured and surprised Hulk. Seeking to end the fight without any more conflict, Thor then tried to use \nBlack Widow\n's calming technique which Romanoff had often used during their time in the Avengers, in a final attempt to turn Hulk back into Bruce Banner and end their fight before anybody could be seriously hurt.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is smashed into the ground by \nHulk\n \n \nDespite Thor insisting that he would not hurt Hulk anymore, the plan had failed to work, and Hulk smashed Thor into the arena's ground repeatedly, before launching Thor across the arena, much to Loki's considerable joy since Hulk attacked him similarly during the \nBattle of New York\n. While Hulk celebrated and enjoyed the cheers from the crowds of \nSakaarans\n who were supporting him, Thor got back to his feet and prepared to keep fighting.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor gaining upper hand against \nHulk\n \n \nAnnoyed all his attempts were having no effect, Thor decided he had had enough and, armed with the \nSakaaran War Hammer\n, proceeded to fight back against Hulk, with his \nAsgardian\n strength combined with his long history of fighting allowing him to gain the upper hand over Hulk's pure rage. As they continued fighting, Thor managed to destroy Hulk's \nSakaaran Battle Axe\n and attempted to beat him down until he could force Hulk to transform back in Banner.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor becomes overpowered by \nHulk\n \n \nWhile Thor expressed his embarrassment that Hulk was fighting him even after Thor claimed they were friends, they briefly engaged in some hand-to-hand combat, with Thor still proving himself to be the superior fighter as he put Hulk into a headlock. However, as Thor regained the War Hammer and attempted to launch another attack, Hulk grabbed the hammer before Thor could strike him with it. Thor was caught off-guard as Hulk punched him clear across the arena.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor's entire body surges with lightning\n \n \nWhile Thor was lying on his back, Hulk proceeded to leap on top of him and began to beat him into submission, much to the delight of everybody watching, including Grandmaster. As Thor's protection, his \nhelmet\n, was knocked off, he was almost beaten to death but was given a vision of \nOdin\n, which allowed Thor to tap into a previously unknown source of power as his entire body surged with lightning. As Hulk paused, unsure of what to make of this, Thor struck him with a lightning-charged punch, knocking the brute flat on his back.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor battles against \nHulk\n \n \nThe powerful strike damaged Hulk's \nSakaaran Battle Armor\n and gave Thor the support of the \nSakaarans\n who began chanting Thor's name. Charged up with his newfound powers, Thor ran towards Hulk, who was furious that he was losing the support of the people. As both combatants simultaneously launched at one another, Thor delivered another blow, more powerful than the last, creating a visible shockwave and flooring Hulk.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being incapacitated by \nGrandmaster\n \n \nAs the fight had finally begun to reach its conclusion, Thor was still winning against Hulk, to the shock of \nKorg\n and all the gladiators of the \nContest of Champions\n as well as the spectators, while \nValkyrie\n watched from \nWarsong\n. However, Grandmaster, unwilling to see Hulk lose since he was a fan favorite, cheated and \"fixed\" the fight by activating his \nObedience Disk\n.

Getting to his feet, Thor put his \nAsgardian\n armor back on before exploring the room, discovering that \nHulk\n was also there, and was taking a bath at that moment, as Thor first confirmed that Hulk would not attempt to attack him again.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor begins asking \nHulk\n about \nSakaar\n \n \nThor began questioning Hulk about exactly how he had managed to get into \nSakaar\n, becoming frustrated as Hulk struggled to answer his questions. When Hulk claimed he had gotten where he was by winning at the \nContest of Champions\n, Thor insisted that he had won by cheating since \nGrandmaster\n had activated his \nObedience Disk\n. Hulk finally revealed that he arrived in the \nQuinjet\n, then showing where it was in a scrapyard, walking by Thor while naked.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor asks \nHulk\n to come to \nAsgard\n \n \nReclaiming his possessions, Thor asked Hulk to come to \nAsgard\n with him and ensure that \nHela\n did not cause \nRagnark\n. However, Hulk refused to leave Sakaar and return to the \nEarth\n, explaining that he still believed he was utterly hated back on the Earth ever since the events of the \nDuel of Johannesburg\n where Hulk had inadvertently endangered the lives of innocent people and therefore, he would not leave Sakaar where he was adored by thousands of his fans.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns he cannot leave \nHulk\n's room\n \n \nAlthough Thor attempted to convince Hulk that everybody loved him since he was a member of the \nAvengers\n, Hulk insisted that Thor was only friends with \nBruce Banner\n, which Thor denied by claiming that he did not even like Banner. Hulk, however, still refused to go with Thor to Asgard to confront Hela, as the annoyed Thor made his way out while insulting the room. However, Thor discovered the door was electrified and he was unable to leave without being shocked.\n[\n5\n]\nCommunicating with Heimdall\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor communicates with \nHeimdall\n \n \n\"You're talking about evacuating \nAsgard\n?\"\n\"We won't last long if we stay.

We need you.\"\nThor and \nHeimdall\n[src]\nTrapped in their room, Thor watched while \nHulk\n had put back on his \nSakaaran Battle Armor\n and went training with \nValkyrie\n for his next fight with the \nContest of Champions\n. Once he was alone, Thor had meditated and attempted to come into contact with \nHeimdall\n back on \nAsgard\n in order to learn what was happening while he was still trapped on \nSakaar\n and unable to return home to aid Heimdall.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nHeimdall\n speaking to each other\n \n \nManaging to get through to Heimdall, Thor was immediately shown that Asgard was currently in an utterly dire situation as Heimdall was being forced to evacuate the \nAsgardians\n before \nHela\n to imprison or execute them, having already slaughtered the \nWarriors Three\n while Thor had been gone. Thor expressed his desire to return to Asgard and stop Hela and keep the people safe, confessing that he did not actually know where he was currently within the universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor asks \nHeimdall\n how to return to \nAsgard\n \n \nAs Heimdall explained Hela was planning to use her newly regained power to consume all the \nNine Realms\n, he then suggested that Thor could possibly be able to get out of \nSakaar\n by going through many of the wormholes that littered the sky. As Heimdall drew \nHofund\n due to being attacked by Hela's \nBerserkers\n, Thor questioned which one of the wormholes to use to escape and Heimdall suggested that he use the \nbiggest one\n before their communication had then ended.\n[\n5\n]\nCatching Up with Hulk\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to rip out his \nObedience Disk\n \n \n\"We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.\"\n\"Yeah, same.

Hulk like raging fire.\"\nThor and \nHulk\n[src]\nStill determined to get out of \nSakaar\n and return to \nAsgard\n in order to help his people in their battle against \nHela\n, Thor attempted to rip out of his \nObedience Disk\n out of his neck once again to which he had no luck as it had instead caused him considerable pain. Seeing this, \nHulk\n noted how sad Thor looked, to which Thor simply told him to shut up as he sat alone and contemplated his next move.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nHulk\n have a furious argument\n \n \nWhile Hulk pushed him over and still continued teasing him, the annoyed Thor rebutted that he was furious to what had happened to his home, the death of \nOdin\n and the destruction of \nMjlnir\n before he had become imprisoned by \nGrandmaster\n. When Hulk had appeared to ignore all of Thor's complaints, Thor accused him of not listening and began kicking some stuff towards Hulk and accusing him of currently being a really bad friend.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor accusing \nHulk\n of almost killing him\n \n \nAs their childish argument continued, Hulk told Thor to stop kicking stuff, to which Thor responded by claiming that Hulk was known as the stupid member of the \nAvengers\n, as Hulk called Thor the tiny Avenger. As his temper rose, Hulk threw a shield at Thor which nearly decapitated him, resulting in Thor angrily claiming that everybody on the \nEarth\n did hate Hulk, which Thor soon realized had greatly upset Hulk, who sat down on his bed and sulked.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor calmly catches back up with \nHulk\n \n \nSeeing that he had genuinely upset him, Thor decided to apologize, and Hulk accepted, noting that nobody actually called Hulk the stupid Avenger. As they sat together, Thor claimed they are very alike, with Hulk comparing himself to raging fire and Thor to either water or a smoldering fire. Once he got Hulk to calm down, Thor told him to do something of his favor, asking him to bring \nValkyrie\n to his room so he could convince her to help him to escape.\n[\n5\n]\nTricking Valkyrie\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tricking \nValkyrie\n into meeting with him\n \n \n\"I'm putting together a team.

Thor then revealed himself in the room, awkwardly trying to look impressive before Valkyrie simply ignored him and prepared to leave the room, as she claimed that Thor was too thick headed to see she was in \nSakaar\n only to hide away from her problems.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to recruit \nValkyrie\n \n \nAs Hulk threw part of his bed to ensure she did not leave, Valkyrie agreed to listen for as long as it took her to drink a large bottle of alcohol. Thor began explaining how \nAsgard\n was currently in danger and he needed her help to return there. However, he soon discovered that Valkyrie was a faster drinker than he expected as he soon was out of time. Thor then explained that \nOdin\n was dead and \nHela\n had invaded Asgard, which caused Valkyrie to stop in her tracks.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explains about \nHela\n's return\n \n \nThor then insisted that he currently planned on stopping Hela by putting together a \nteam\n which he wanted both Hulk and Valkyrie to be a part of, although both refused to help him. When Thor tried to reach her by calling out the legend of the \nValkyries\n, she explained to him how she had witnessed Odin lose control of Hela, resulting in the horrifying \nMassacre of the Valkyrie\n in \nHel\n, which is what had led her to not wanting anything more to do with Asgard and Odin's family.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor successfully deceives \nValkyrie\n \n \nValkyrie explained the problem with the \nAsgardian Royal Family\n while Thor tried to explain that he agreed with her, while Valkyrie held her knives to his throat as a warning to not get too familiar with her. Thor told her that these issues were the reasons he had turned down the throne, noting that this was not about the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n or even the two of them, but the \nAsgardians\n themselves who were in danger. But still, Valkyrie refused to be involved in the fight against Hela.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor beginning his own escape from \nSakaar\n \n \nThor, however, revealed that he had gotten closer to Valkyrie simply to steal the control to his \nObedience Disk\n, allowing himself to finally be free of \nGrandmaster\n's control. With that, Thor took a ball while Hulk had been playing with and used it to crack the room's glass window, although this resulted with the ball bouncing back and striking Thor directly into the face. Jumping back up as if nothing happened, Thor said this was what heroes did before leaping out of the window.\n[\n5\n]\nSaving Asgard\n[\n]\nEscaping Grandmaster\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to unlock \nQuinjet\n's access\n \n \n\"Quite a lot's happened.

Activating the Quinjet, Thor had announced himself by his name, but this was rejected. Having tried several other names including the God of Thunder and the Strongest \nAvenger\n, Thor finally cursed \nTony Stark\n as he used the codename \nPoint Break\n which Stark had previously given him, and was given clearance.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor watches \nHulk\n destroying the \nQuinjet\n \n \nHowever, before Thor could take off and escape from Sakaar, Hulk suddenly appeared and pushed his way on board, destroying almost everything in his path while he demanded that Thor stay on Sakaar with the \nContest of Champions\n. It was only when Thor accidentally activated a recording of \nBlack Widow\n's attempts to get Hulk to turn the Quinjet around following the \nBattle of Sokovia\n that Hulk pacified and transformed into \nBruce Banner\n, despite some resistance.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to calm \nBruce Banner\n down\n \n \nThor approached Banner who was confused by his surroundings, as he questioned what had happened about \nUltron\n. Eventually, Thor had realized that Banner had been in Hulk form since \nSokovia\n and, as a result, Hulk had completely taken over. Because of this, Banner was powerless and dID not remember anything that has happened for the past two years since, questioning what happened with Ultron, where he currently was and what had happened to Thor's hair.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nGrandmaster\n's warning\n \n \nWhile Thor tried to explain everything, Banner checked the Quinjet's records and saw footage of Hulk being sucked through a wormhole. \nGrandmaster\n then appeared in a massive projection above the city, explaining that his beloved champion had been kidnapped by Thor and ordering the \nSakaarans\n to find them. Thor told Banner that he had been there for some time, noting that he was champion and they had just had a \nbattle\n which Thor had claimed to have won before they then made their escape.\n[\n5\n]\nHelping Bruce Banner\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attempts to accompany \nBruce Banner\n \n \n\"\nMy people\n are in great danger.

As Banner struggled to remain calm, he explained how he had experienced \nHulk\n taking full control for the first time ever, an experience which had clearly shaken Banner as he refused to turn back into Hulk.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns Banner will not turn into \nHulk\n \n \nThe pair then discussed how they planned to leave \nSakaar\n and get back to \nAsgard\n, as Thor explained how he required Hulk's help in his attempts to stop \nHela\n from taking over the \nNine Realms\n. However, Banner, already highly agitated despite Thor's attempts to keep him calm, insisted all he wanted to do is go to \nEarth\n and be left in peace, not wishing to get involved with his family issue or fight any more evil beings, as he felt that Thor was just using him to get to Hulk.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nBanner\n make their escape\n \n \nThe pair got into a debate about if Banner would be useful in battling Hela's armies of \nBerserkers\n even without turning into Hulk, with Banner insisting that his seven PhDs made him useful, which Thor was unconvinced by. Finally, Banner agreed to accompany Thor to Asgard on the condition that he didn't have to think about Hulk ever again before they both made their way through the streets, with Banner complaining that \nTony Stark\n's clothing was too tight.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is eventually reunited with \nValkyrie\n \n \nJust as Thor promised Banner he would not have to think of Hulk anymore, they were separated in a \nContest of Champions\n party. As the pair were briefly threatened by \nBiff\n only for \nValkyrie\n to appear and use Biff's \nObedience Disk\n to subdue him. While Thor had still insisted he could have subdued Biff himself, Valkyrie questioned who Banner was, failing to recognize Banner as Hulk, before taking them away for a private conversation while Thor awkwardly flirted with her.\n[\n5\n]\nForming the Revengers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is offered the assistance of \nValkyrie\n \n \n\"What do you say, doctor?

Valkyrie then agreed to help Thor in his mission to rescue the \nAsgardians\n, hoping that it could have also involved the defeat of Hela which she had wanted for thousands of years. Thor accepted her help, explaining their team would be called the \nRevengers\n as he claimed they were all looking for revenge.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is brought to the chained up \nLoki\n.\n \n \nValkyrie then showed her peace offering, a chained up \nLoki\n, as Thor confirmed this was not merely another illusion by throwing a bottle at Loki's head. While Loki spoke with \nBruce Banner\n, Thor explored Valkyrie's room and found her \nDragonfang\n which Thor then admired. Valkyrie then discussed the best route to \nAsgard\n, suggested going through a wormhole to \nXandar\n where they could quickly refuel until they had eventually made it back to Asgard in eighteen months.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nBruce Banner\n discuss their plan\n \n \nRemembering what \nHeimdall\n had said to him, however, Thor then suggested they travel through the largest wormhole, which Valkyrie informed him was named the \nDevil's Anus\n, much to both Thor and Banner's surprise. Looking at the Anus, Valkyrie noted that they would need another ship as the Anus would tear her \nWarsong\n into pieces if they had attempted to use that, as Thor and Banner then discussed what they would need to survive the journey.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tells stories of \nLoki\n's murderous tricks\n \n \nWhile they discussed which ship to use, Loki then interrupted them, explaining that he no longer wanted to be stuck on Sakaar since he had fallen out of favor with \nGrandmaster\n. Although Loki told Thor he had Grandmaster's security codes which gave him control over his systems, Banner expressed his distrust of Loki in the wake of the \nChitauri Invasion\n of \nEarth\n, while Thor retold a story of when Loki had turned into a snake and stabbed him when they were children.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor, \nValkyrie\n, \nBruce Banner\n listen to \nLoki\n \n \nWhile Loki suggested that they set \nHulk\n free and allowing him to help them escape, Thor claimed he was lying as Valkyrie got excited. Thor then suggested that they start a revolution to help distract Grandmaster's guards while they stole Grandmaster's \npersonal ship\n to escape.

The brothers then armed themselves with \nSakaaran Laser Rifles\n and proceeded to fire upon the small army of \nSakaaran Guards\n who were standing in their way.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights against \nGrandmaster\n's guards\n \n \nWhile taking cover, Loki noted that \nOdin\n had brought them together when he had taken Loki from \nJotunheim\n, claiming that it was almost poetic that his death then broke them apart for good. Thor continued firing while Loki unlocked the doorways, while still claiming that they might as well become strangers, before being threatened by another Sakaaran Guard who Thor dispatched by forcing him to fire into the ground which shot him into the air as they entered the elevator.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nLoki\n discussing their futures apart\n \n \nOnce they got inside the elevator, Loki suggested that he should actually stay in \nSakaar\n, which Thor immediately agreed with as he claimed it fit his brother's lawless and chaotic personality perfectly, much to Loki's surprise. Thor went on to admit that he had always thought the world of Loki and hoped they would always fight together. However, he had come to the conclusion that this would never happen due to their differences and they were better off going their separate ways, which resonated with Loki, who seemingly agreed.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nLoki\n use their \"Get Help\" strategy\n \n \nKnowing that they would soon encounter more of Grandmaster's guards, Thor suggested that they utilize their \"Get Help\" strategy, much to Loki's horror. Although he tried to object, Thor still managed to convince Loki as they ran out with Thor pretending Loki needed some medical assistance before throwing his brother at the Sakaaran Guards, knocking him out. Thor delighted in the successful strategy while Loki continued moaning about how humiliating it was.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor manages to deceive and subdue \nLoki\n \n \nWhile they went to steal the \nCommodore\n from Grandmaster, Loki, inevitably, betrayed them as they are escaping, attempting to alert Grandmaster. However, Thor placed the \nObedience Disk\n on his back, leaving him being shocked on the floor. Thor told his brother that he knew Loki will always be the God of Mischief, but had hoped that he would have shown some capacity for growth before leaving, with Loki still being shocked and the remote just out of reach.\n[\n5\n]\nEscape from Sakaar\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor piloting the \nCommodore\n over \nSakaar\n \n \n\"It's a leisure vessel. \nGrandmaster\n uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.\"\n\"Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?\"\n\"Yeah. Don't touch anything.\"\n\nValkyrie\n, \nBruce Banner\n and Thor\n[src]\nHaving taken control of the \nCommodore\n, Thor then piloted the ship high over \nSakaar\n while \nGrandmaster\n alerted his followers of the situation and ordered them to find and capture Thor, noting that he had also kidnapped \nHulk\n. Thor was soon targeted by Grandmaster's Sakaaran ships until \nValkyrie\n then flew by while onboard her own \nWarsong\n and then assisted Thor by shooting the other ships out of the sky.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor regroups with \nBruce Banner\n \n \nWhile \nBruce Banner\n was launched up inside the \nCommodore\n from \nWarsong\n, Thor soon found himself being shot at by \nTopaz\n. As they looked for weapons, Thor discovered that it was merely the leisure vehicle which Grandmaster used for orgies, much to the shared disgust of Thor and Banner. The pair then watched as Topaz destroyed Valkyrie's \nWarsong\n, only for Valkyrie to survive and launch herself onto the \nCommodore\n. When Thor told her to get inside, Valkyrie refused and then attacked the other ships.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights alongside \nValkyrie\n \n \nWhile Banner was left in complete control of the \nCommodore\n, Thor and Valkyrie proceeded to use their own \nAsgardian\n strength to rip Grandmaster's ships apart with their bare hands, with Valkyrie also using her \nDragonfang\n to tear through the ship's armor plating. While Banner was able to cause Topaz to crash using Grandmaster's birthday firework display, Thor and Valkyrie destroyed the final ship before then leaping back on board the \nCommodore\n together.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor flies through the \nDevil's Anus\n \n \nHaving taken out all of Grandmaster's defenses and finally gotten away from Sakaar, Thor and the \nRevengers\n had prepared themselves to fly through the \nDevil's Anus\n and head back towards \nAsgard\n so that they could stop \nHela\n from completing her plans to take over the \nNine Realms\n. As they avoided the debris that was flying through the Anus, they made their way to the gateway, expressing heavy friction which knocked them out just as they traveled through the wormhole.\n[\n5\n]\nDuel in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor calls upon \nHela\n to face against him\n \n \n\"It seems our \nfather\n's solution to every problem was to cover it up.\"\n\"Or to cast it out. He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.\"\n\nHela\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor, \nValkyrie\n and \nBruce Banner\n arrived on \nAsgard\n. As a result, \nHela\n began an assault on the \nfortress\n where \nHeimdall\n was hiding the \nAsgardians\n. All of a sudden, Thor managed to call her back to the \nthrone room\n to fight. After a talk about \nOdin\n, Thor and Hela fought. Although Thor used \nGungnir\n to attack Hela, he quickly found her to be the more skilled and powerful one out of the two.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor pinned down by \nHela\n \n \nAlthough he managed to hit her twice, Hela quickly recovered and blocked all his attack before sarcastically stating that she expected much more from Thor and then counter-attacking, lifting Thor off his feet and disarming him of Gungnir before choking him and saying he was worth nothing. Thor tried to fight back desperately using a pair of blades, but Hela easily outmatched and stabbed Thor multiple times with her \nNecrosword\n. Hela struck him across the face, cutting out his eye.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor focuses on his power in his vision\n \n \nHela was too much for Thor and once again, he had a vision of his \nfather\n in \nNorway\n. Thor stated that Asgard had fallen. However, Odin told him that \nAsgard\n was not a place, but a people. Thor stated he could not defeat Hela without \nMjlnir\n, but Odin reminded Thor that he was not a god of hammers, but the god of thunder; Mjlnir was only ever a focus for his powers and they are greater than Odin's.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle for Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor regains all of his lightning powers\n \n \n\"The longer \nHela\n's on \nAsgard\n, the more powerful she grows. She'll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.\"\nThor to \nValkyrie\n[src]\nHela\n slammed Thor to the ground and taunted him, questioning what he was the god of. In response, Thor summoned a massive bolt of lightning and blasted away Hela, temporarily incapacitating her. Thor leaped onto the \nRainbow Bridge\n to assist \nLoki\n's forces. This prompted smiles from his allies.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor standing with his \nteammates\n \n \nWith his powers in full force, Thor carved through Hela's army of \nBerserkers\n with ease. He managed to get through to Loki and \nValkyrie\n after battling against the Berserkers. As the remaining \nRevengers\n assembled, Thor made an obligation to Valkyrie to disband the team after all was done. Thor looked over to Hela and got ready to a fight, as Loki suggested to hit her with a lighting blast but argued that he already hit her with one of all his might and did not work.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor continues to battle against \nHela\n \n \nThor realized that as long as Asgard would stand, Hela would hunt them down without stopping. Looking over the \nStatesman\n, Thor also realized that \nAsgard\n was a people as opposed to a place. He and Loki agreed on the former point, to which Thor stated that they had to ensure \nRagnark\n as oppose to stop it. Despite Thor's boldness, Loki ran off to go inside the \nvault\n. Thor looked over to Valkyrie and suggested to fight against Hela.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor acknowledges \nSurtur\n to \nHela\n \n \nWhile Loki flew the \nCommodore\n and went into the vault to revive \nSurtur\n, Thor and Valkyrie fought off Hela using their skills to harm her. Despite Thor having his powers in full force, Hela still managed to overpower him. Hela knocked Thor down and stated that he could not defeat her. However, at that moment, Loki unleashed Surtur, who emerged from the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n. Valkyrie took the chance to knock down Hela, and Thor blasted Hela off from the Rainbow Bridge.\n[\n5\n]\nDestruction of Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses the destruction of Asgard\n \n \n\"What have I done?\"\n\"You saved us from extinction. \nAsgard\n is not a place... it's a \npeople\n.\"\nThor and \nHeimdall\n[src]\nThe now much more powerful \nSurtur\n began laying waste to \nAsgard\n and even \nHela\n was unable to stop him. Thor and \nValkyrie\n were ready to stay in Asgard, hating the prophecy for it, until \nHulk\n attacked Surtur, but Thor called him off. Hulk carried Thor and Valkyrie aboard the \nStatesman\n, which escaped as Asgard was utterly destroyed, leaving only asteroids behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor ponders his missing eye\n \n \nAs Thor put on his new eyepatch on, \nLoki\n walked into his room and remarked his new look as reminiscent to their \nfather\n's. Thor, believing his brother had already left the ship, jokingly remarked if he was here, he would give him a hug. Thor threw an object towards Loki, but caught it quickly. Loki reassured him that he was really here. The two made their way towards the deck.\n[\n5\n]\nInfinity War\n[\n]\nHeading Towards Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is crowned as the King of Asgard\n \n \n\"\nPeople\n on \nEarth\n love me, I'm very popular.\"\n\"Let me rephrase that: Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?\"\n\"Probably not, to be honest. I wouldn't worry, brother.\"\nThor and \nLoki\n[src]\nHeimdall found Thor wearing his eyepatch and noted to Thor that they had lost many people, but Thor assured him that no-one could have done more and that \nOdin\n would have been proud of Heimdall who told Thor that Odin was proud of him.\n[\n33\n]\n Thor was then crowned King of the \nAsgardians\n and sat on a throne at the side of the \nStatesman\n. \nHeimdall\n requested on where to go now, to which Thor was unsure of. After trying to get any suggestions on where to go, he decided that they should set course for \nEarth\n to rebuild \nAsgard\n, perhaps in \nNorway\n as Odin suggested.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to return to \nEarth\n with \nLoki\n \n \nSpending \nmonths\n in space en route to Earth, \nLoki\n visited Thor and asked if it was a good idea to return to Earth, to which he said it was since everyone loved him there. Loki then declared, saying that he was talking about himself. Thor then assured to Loki that everything would be fine, only to watch a \nlarger ship\n approaching them, to Thor and Loki's shock and horror.\n[\n5\n]\nAttack on the \nStatesman\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is utterly defeated by \nThanos\n \n \n\"It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you to what end? Dread it? Run from it? Destiny arrives all the same, and now it's here. Or should I say: I am.\"\n\"You talk too much.\"\n\nThanos\n and Thor\n[src]\nThe \nStatesman\n was soon boarded by \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n. Though \nValkyrie\n led half the people to escape pods, Thor remained behind and led the defense against the invaders only to be personally confronted and easily beaten to submission by Thanos.\n[\n34\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being vigorously tortured by \nThanos\n \n \nIn his weakened state, Thor was taken hostage by Thanos in order to force \nLoki\n to surrender the \nTesseract\n, something Thor believed had been destroyed \nwith the rest\n of Asgard. Thanos then began torturing Thor with the \nPower Stone\n, leading to Loki revealing the Tesseract, prompting Thor to bitterly insult his brother and call him the worst. However, Loki soon revealed that he had merely been stalling for time so that \nHulk\n could ambush Thanos and he proceeded to tackle Thor to safety. Though the gamma-beast initially gave a good account of himself, Thanos quickly triumphed over the Avenger.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor desperately attempts to attack \nThanos\n \n \nIn his rage, Thor attempted to once again attack Thanos only to be swatted aside with ease and restrained in metal by \nEbony Maw\n's telekinetic powers. \nHeimdall\n then used the last of his strength to summon the \nBifrost\n and send Hulk to Earth so that he could have warned the planet of Thanos, an act for which Thanos claimed his life much to Thor's rage who swore to kill the Titan in retaliation. Unamused, Ebony Maw simply gagged Thor.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is tightly constricted by \nEbony Maw\n \n \nAfter Thanos had claimed the \nSpace Stone\n within the Tesseract, he directed the Black Order to Earth for the \nTime\n and \nMind\n Stones, allowing Thor to deduce Thanos himself was going after the \nReality Stone\n. Loki then stepped forward and offered to renew his allegiance to Thanos, sparing a glance at Thor to try and inform him of his true intentions. Unfortunately, Thanos easily anticipated Loki's attack and betrayal and choked him to death, mocking Thor that his brother would not be \"resurrected\" this time.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sadly mourns over \nLoki\n's corpse\n \n \nWith having his stone secured onto the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos used the Power Stone to destroy the remains of the \nStatesman\n before teleporting away. Freed from Maw's influence, Thor broke his restraints and fell to the ground, crawling over to Loki's corpse, openly grieving for his brother by his name only to get no response, as the \nStatesman\n exploded around them, Thor remained as the only survivor.\n[\n6\n]\nRescued in Space\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor meeting the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n \n \n\"Only \nEitri\n the \nDwarf\n King can make me the \nweapon\n I need.

Will you join me on my quest to \nNidavellir\n?\"\nThor and \nRocket\n[src]\nLeft for dead in the vastness of space, Thor's barely conscious body was found by the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n who brought him aboard the \nBenatar\n. After \nMantis\n probed his surface thoughts and emotions, she woke him at \nStar-Lord\n's command. Thor awoke abruptly before questioning his now armed saviors who they were. Given food and a blanket, Thor calmed down and told the Guardians that \nThanos\n was on the warpath and that he had \ndestroyed\n half of \nXandar\n for the \nPower Stone\n. \nGamora\n then revealed herself as Thanos' adopted daughter and a defected member of the \nBlack Order\n, who informed Thor that Thanos' endgame was to use all the \nInfinity Stones\n to wipe out half of all life in the universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explains the \nstones\n to the \nGuardians\n \n \nSeeking revenge on the \nTitan\n, Thor attempted to commandeer the \nBenatar\n's \nspace pod\n to fly to \nNidavellir\n and acquire a \nnew weapon\n while directing the Guardians to \nKnowhere\n so they could secure the \nReality Stone\n from the \nCollector\n, knowing it was the only possible objective Thanos would have. When questioned as to why, Thor revealed the \nMind Stone\n and \nTime Stone\n were on \nEarth\n, and protected by the \nAvengers\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor bids farewell to the \nGuardians\n \n \nOnce explaining who the Avengers were, Thor explained that he needed a new weapon to kill Thanos by going to Nidavellir. As \nRocket\n expressed interest in joining the mission, Thor allowed him and \nGroot\n to tag along, thinking Rocket as a rabbit who seemed like a noble leader. After Rocket proposed the idea of going with the mission, Thor bid the \"morons\" farewell, wishing them luck getting the \nReality Stone\n.\n[\n6\n]\nTraveling to Nidavellir\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor arrives and observes \nNidavellir\n \n \n\"I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. \nThanos\n is just the latest in a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.\"\nThor to \nRocket\n[src]\nThor, \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n made for the Dwarven star forge of \nNidavellir\n to forge a \nweapon\n powerful enough to kill \nThanos\n. As Rocket comforted him over the loss of his \nfamily\n and \npeople\n, Thor assured him that his pain had given him the focus needed for avenging them. He was soon given a \nnew eye\n by Rocket to replace his lost one. However, upon arrival, they found the Realm devastated, the forge extinguished and the \nDwarves\n massacred.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor notices the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n's mold\n \n \nThor and the two \nGuardians\n boarded the realm to go inside where they noticed the mold for the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n, only for the Dwarf King, \nEitri\n, to attack them in a fit of rage. Thor tried to calm down Eitri by telling it was him, to which Eitri recognized him and stopped attacking. Eitri angrily told that \nAsgard\n was supposed to protect the Dwarves, but Thor explained that it was \ndestroyed\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor motivates \nEitri\n to build a new weapon\n \n \nCalmly sitting down, Eitri told Thor that Thanos forced him to forge the Infinity Gauntlet to harness the power of the \nInfinity Stones\n, before being crippled and forced to watch his people be \nexecuted\n. Understanding what Eitri had been gone through, Thor motivated him to build a new weapon by stating his mind was all important to building any arsenal, knowing that it would feel like all hope had lost, and he declared that he and Eitri could kill Thanos.\n[\n6\n]\nForging the Axe\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor assists on creating \nStormbreaker\n \n \n\"Allfathers, give me strength.\"\n\"You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.\"\nThor and \nEitri\n[src]\nTogether with \nEitri\n, Thor, \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n went to the ring and observed a mold that served as a powerful substance for a King's weapon. Since the ring had been frozen, Thor had the idea of using the \npod\n to work around the gears to repair and restart \nNidavellir\n's forge, in order to complete \nStormbreaker\n, a powerful axe capable of killing \nThanos\n and summon the \nBifrost\n. However, the iris mechanism focusing the star's energy, required to heat the \nUru\n metal ingots for the weapon, was crippled.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor unconscious and heavily wounded\n \n \nVolunteering to physically hold the iris doors open, Thor opened the full brunt of the star's power to light the forge and allow Eitri to heat the metal and pour it into the mold. However, Thor fell unconscious partway through the process, shutting the iris and leaving the weapon without a handle. With Stormbreaker being the only thing that could heal Thor, Eitri searched for the handle to no avail. Having an idea, Groot used his own arm to create a handle, completing Stormbreaker.\n[\n6\n]\nBattle of Wakanda\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor, \nRocket\n, and \nGroot\n arrive in \nWakanda\n \n \n\"Bring me \nThanos\n!\"\nThor\n[src]\nAs he recovered from his wounds with his new profound \nweapon\n, the trio decided to leave \nNidavellir\n and head to \nEarth\n. Summoning the \nBifrost Bridge\n, Thor touched down into the land of \nWakanda\n as the heroes in battle were in danger of being overrun by the \nOutriders\n. Thor's power quickly turned the tide of the battle and brought hope to the \nhumans\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor unleashing an attack on the \nOutriders\n \n \nDuring the numerous attacks on his allies, Thor threw Stormbreaker at the many Outriders that were hurdling away from them as well as the many that were attacking the rest of his teammates. Once Stormbreaker returned to his hand, closing the Bifrost, Thor proceeded to look over at the crowd of Outriders and began to run up to them while yelling at them to bring him \nThanos\n, before attacking the abundance of them with one swing.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor introduces \nGroot\n to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nAs the battle on Wakanda continued, Thor spent most of the battle on the ground and killed as many Outriders as he could with multiple swings that proved fatal with each attack. Being noticed by \nSteve Rogers\n in the battle for his haircut, Thor quickly recognized his beard as he assumed that he copied his beard. Following up, Thor introduced his new ally \nGroot\n to Rogers, as he was killing a row of Outriders with one arm.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attacks the \nOutrider Dropships\n \n \nAs the battle was on the brink of winning, Thor flew over a horde of Outriders that were leaving and heading towards the \ndropships\n to escape but were quickly executed with a swing in the air while summoning lighting. In the air, Thor flew upwards to get a view on his enemies and began to attack the numerous active dropships by slaughtering every single one of them as the battle had begun to end, with the Wakandan army celebrating their victory.\n[\n6\n]\nArrival of the Titan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor violently attacks \nThanos\n with lightning\n \n \n\"I told you... you'd die for that!\"\n\"You should have... you should... you should have gone for the head.\"\nThor and \nThanos\n[src]\nWhen \nThanos\n arrived, he managed to defeat everyone that stood in his way and successfully extracted the \nMind Stone\n from \nVision\n to complete the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n. As the \nTitan\n basked in his victory, Thor unleashed a devastating attack with \nStormbreaker\n, knocking his foe back and prompting him to retaliate with an energy beam from the completed Gauntlet. Undeterred, Thor charged his axe with all his power and threw it with all his might,\n[\n6\n]\n but chose to strike Thanos directly in the chest, so that he could taunt the Mad Titan to his face.\n[\n35\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor plunges \nStormbreaker\n into \nThanos\n \n \nWith the axe overpowering Thanos, Thor savored his revenge by reminding Titan of his earlier promise to kill him for \nattacking\n \nhis people\n, inflicting further pain on Thanos. Unfortunately, Thor underestimated Thanos' resilience and was mocked in the face for not having struck him in the head for an instant kill, catching him completely off-guard and before Thor could further injure Thanos, the Titan managed to muster the strength to \nsnap\n his fingers as Thor yelled in horror, as the Gauntlet was activated and the energy that surged from it covered the battlefield with light and caused an ominous rumbling throughout the whole universe.\n[\n6\n]\nThanos' Victory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor shocked at the damaged \nGauntlet\n \n \n\"What did you do? What did you do?!\"\nThor to \nThanos\n[src]\nThor was left shocked by the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n's use by \nThanos\n, and questioned what Thanos had done but he was ignored by the Mad Titan, who simply gave him a mocking smirk and activated the heavily damaged Infinity Gauntlet in front of him and disappeared with a \nportal\n conjured by the \nSpace Stone\n, leaving \nStormbreaker\n on the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor realizes what \nThanos\n had done\n \n \nWhile recalling \nGamora\n's words, Thor was stunned on how he failed to murder Thanos when he had the chance and that had caused Thanos to succeed in his goals. Unable to answer when \nSteve Rogers\n asked \nwhere\n Thanos had gone, Thor could only watch in horror as many of his allies and the rest of life on the universe had been disintegrated into dust, realizing the extent of his folly.\n[\n6\n]\nLife of Guilt\n[\n]\nArrival of Captain Marvel\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor feeling the guilt following the \nSnap\n \n \n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\"Oh, he's pissed.

Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?\"\n\nTony Stark\n and \nRocket\n[src]\nFollowing the \nSnap\n, Thor and the remaining \nAvengers\n, along with \nRocket\n, returned to the \nAvengers Compound\n. Feeling a great deal of guilt, seeing the Snap as his own personal failure, Thor became silent and separated from everyone else for the next few days. When they encountered \nCaptain Marvel\n, she went out to \nrescue\n \nTony Stark\n from space.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tests \nCarol Danvers\n with \nStormbreaker\n \n \nCaptain Marvel eventually returned, landing the \nBenatar\n outside, but Thor did not come out, and even when they were all together inside, Thor sat in the other room. When \nNebula\n revealed the \nlocation\n of \nThanos\n, Thor stayed silent as the Avengers discussed their next move. When Captain Marvel suggested just going to Thanos and taking the \nInfinity Stones\n, Thor finally joined in, testing the new arrival by summoning \nStormbreaker\n, which she did not flinch from. He then expressed his reverence for her, and they all prepared for the mission.\n[\n22\n]\nAmbush on Thanos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor realizing the \nInfinity Stones\n are gone\n \n \n\"What did you do?\"\n\"I went for the head.\"\n\nRocket\n and Thor\n[src]\nThey all then suited up and boarded the \nBenatar\n, where they began their journey to the \nGarden\n. Once they arrived, \nCaptain Marvel\n did recon on the planet, detecting only \nThanos\n to be there. After Captain Marvel's first move, \nWar Machine\n and \nBruce Banner\n entered the \nhut\n and restrained him, allowing Thor to burst in and slice off Thanos' left hand, separating him from the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor cuts off \nThanos\n' head\n \n \nHowever, when \nRocket\n turned over the Gauntlet, they discovered that the \nInfinity Stones\n were gone. They began to desperately demand Thanos to reveal where the stones were, but he told them that he had destroyed them due to \nhis plan\n being fulfilled and them having no other use. While everyone tried to think that Thanos was lying, Thor just stood in the realization that he had failed once again.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor leaving the \nGarden\n after killing \nThanos\n \n \nAfter \nNebula\n confirmed that Thanos was telling the truth, Thor cut off his head in a rage, fulfilling his revenge and calling back to what Thanos had told him previously about going for the head. However, this was no victory for Thor, but just an emotional impulse coming from his own inability to handle failure, for which he felt even more now. With no other purpose of staying, a shaken Thor then walked out of the hut and returned to the \nBenatar\n.\n[\n22\n]\nNew Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor in his deep state of depression\n \n \n\"He won't see you.\"\n\"It's that bad, huh?\"\n\"We only see him once a month when he comes in for... supplies.\"\n\nValkyrie\n and \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nEven though the \nAmbush on Thanos\n failed, there were still some \nAsgardians\n who had survived \nThanos\n' \nattack\n, so Thor brought them to \nEarth\n, where he transformed \nTnsberg\n to be the \nNew Asgard\n, of which Thor would resume his rule as King. Thor, following the words of \nKorg\n after the \nDestruction of Asgard\n, allowed the survivors of the \nSakaaran Rebellion\n to also inhabit the land.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor with \nKorg\n and \nMiek\n in \nNew Asgard\n \n \nHowever, over the next \nfive years\n, Thor would fall into a deep state of depression, which he would deny with stories that possibly depicted his killing of Thanos as epic rather than the actual tragic reality. He also suppressed his grief through alcoholism,\n[\n22\n]\n causing him to gain serious weight, coming at the cost of most of his strength, leaving him sufficiently weaker than he was before.\n[\n36\n]\n Thor's isolation would be at the detriment of his people and \nValkyrie\n's disappointment, as despite his attempts to assure himself he was fine, he knew he was struggling.\n[\n22\n]\nReturning to the Avengers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor reunites with \nBruce Banner\n \n \n\"Why don't you ask the \nAsgardians\n down there how much my help was worth.

I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and... and saved.\"\nThor and \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nIn \n2023\n, \nRocket\n and \nBruce Banner\n visited \nNew Asgard\n to recruit Thor back to the \nAvengers\n to help retrieve the \nInfinity Stones\n from the past. As the two Avengers entered his \nhome\n, Thor initially believed them to be the repair people for the cable. But, as he retrieved another drink, he saw that it was his friends, for which he was happily surprised by. He enthusiastically hugged them both, as they were surprised after seeing Thor in his different state.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor threatens \nNoobMaster69\n \n \nTheir reunion was interrupted by \nKorg\n, who notified Thor of an abusive \nFortnite\n player called \nNoobMaster69\n, who was insulting him and \nMiek\n. Infuriated, Thor threatened NoobMaster and promised to hurt him if he continued with the insults. As he returned to his drinking, Banner asked how he was going, to which Thor claimed that he was fine. Thor then asked about what they were up to, which Banner revealed that they came to get his help to resurrect the victims of the Snap.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor breaks down from \nThanos\n' name\n \n \nHowever, when Banner mentioned \nThanos\n' name, Thor immediately broke down and threatened Banner to not say that name. Banner then tried to comfort his friend, but Thor continued his denial, trying to use the fact that he killed Thanos as a proud achievement. Banner, understanding the struggle Thor was going through, reminded his friends of how he helped him through his own struggles, reminding him that he helped him get out of his predicament on \nSakaar\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor agrees to rejoin the \nAvengers\n \n \nBut Thor refused to join them, addressing how he viewed himself as a lousy King to his people, at least the ones \nthat were left\n. Thor then tried to relieve his friends' worries by assuring them that he was truly fine and then rejected their request. However, he soon changed his mind once Rocket informed him that there was beer on the \nBenatar\n.\n[\n22\n]\nTime Heist\n[\n]\nDiscussing the Aether\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor arrives at the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"I got to introduce \nher\n to my \nmother\n... who's dead.

The only thing permanent in life is impermanence.\"\nThor to the \nAvengers\n[src]\nThor arrived back at the \nAvengers Compound\n, where he continued to just drink while everyone else was working. As he walked through the hangar, \nTony Stark\n passed him, making a reference to him looking like The Dude from the \nThe Big Lebowski\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor falls asleep during the brainstorm\n \n \nHe then joined everyone as they watched \nClint Barton\n test \ntime travel\n, for which they were successful, so they decided to start planning the \nTime Heist\n. They all gathered as they discussed the best way to retrieve all of the \nInfinity Stones\n from the past, needing to pick the best points in time. \nSteve Rogers\n suggested that they start with the \nAether\n, and asked Thor, as he was the only one who had encountered it. However, they discovered that Thor had fallen asleep during the brainstorm, which they jokingly thought he was dead.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor explaining his history with the \nAether\n \n \nHe then awoke and went to inform them on what he knew about the Aether, but due to his unstable state, he started to ramble. He informed them that it was not a stone, but a liquified weapon forged from the \nReality Stone\n itself, before suggesting a way to contain the Aether as its powers were unpredictable. He then started telling the history of the Aether: how it was \nsecured\n by \nBor\n from \nDark Elves\n and that in \n2013\n, \nJane Foster\n became possessed by it, so he took her to \nAsgard\n to help her. He showed them pictures of Foster, \nDarcy Lewis\n, \nErik Selvig\n, and \nIan Boothby\n during those events.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor goes completely off topic\n \n \nHowever, after the mention of these events, Thor remembered how it was when his \nmother\n was \nkilled\n and that now he and Foster were no longer dating. Thor then became completely distracted from his task and began to go off topic about life and how nothing was permanent. \nTony Stark\n went to stop him, but he finished his point, before asking for a \nBloody Mary\n. Thor then proceeded to sit through the rest of the brainstorming, making himself his drink.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor joining the \nAvengers\n for the \nTime Heist\n \n \nAfter a few days of planning out the heist, Thor joined by \nRocket\n going to Asgard in \n2013\n to steal the Reality Stone, while a team went to \n2012\n to steal the \nMind\n, \nSpace\n and \nTime\n Stones, and another team going to \n2014\n to steal the \nPower\n and \nSoul\n Stones. They all then suited up in their \nTime Suits\n and made their way to the \nQuantum Tunnel\n, where they all listened to Rogers' speech before going to their set destinations.\n[\n22\n]\nTheft of the Reality Stone\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor quietly passes by an imprisoned \nLoki\n \n \n\"\nHis\n head was over there...

Some idiot with an \naxe\n.\"\nThor to \nFrigga\n[src]\nThor and \nRocket\n traveled to \nAsgard\n in \n2013\n to extract the \nAether\n. Passing through the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n, Thor peeked at an incarcerated \nLoki\n in his cell levitating a cup in the air before continuing to the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n. Hiding behind a large column in the palace, Thor and Rocket spotted \nJane Foster\n being escorted by a maiden to one of the chambers to rest and Thor confirmed that it was her.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nRocket\n discuss their plan\n \n \nThe two then hid in the Royal Palace as they discussed their plan, with the suggestion that Thor entertain Foster while Rocket would use the \ndevice\n to extract the \nAether\n from her body. However, Thor changed the subject and attempted to steal some more \nwine\n from \nOdin\n's cellars. A disturbed Rocket asked Thor if he thought he had drunk enough already but Thor ignored his advice and began making his way to the cellar.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor has a panic attack during the mission\n \n \nSuddenly, Thor saw \nFrigga\n and started going into a panic attack, remembering that \nshe\n would die that day during the \nSacking of Asgard\n. As Frigga and her maidens exited the hall, Rocket briefly brought Thor to his senses by slapping him and reminding Thor that he lost the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n to the \nSnap\n as well. Still, Thor was unable to face any of his past and ran away, leaving Rocket to extract the \nReality Stone\n from Foster by himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor being given some advice by \nFrigga\n \n \nWandering around the Royal Palace while spying on Frigga, Thor was surprised by his mother when she confronted him and realized that he was from the future. Thor tried to pretend he was \nhis past self\n, but quickly dropped the faade. He told his alternate mother that he wanted to speak with her, and Frigga hugged him in comfort. In one of her chambers, Thor confided in Frigga about his \nfailure\n to stop \nThanos\n \nfive years ago\n in his timeline, as well as him \nkilling\n him out of anger. Frigga assured Thor he was not an idiot, but indeed a failure, making him just like everyone else.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor says goodbye to his \nmother\n in the \npast\n \n \nFrigga gave Thor advice, reminding him that everyone failed at fulfilling others' expectations at a certain point in life, and their true worth was found by following their own path. Thor then tried to warn his mother about her imminent death, but was cut off by Frigga not wanting to know, as she was prepared to meet her fate with dignity. Suddenly, Rocket rushed in, having \nsuccessfully obtained\n the Aether, telling Thor they had to go. Frigga gave Thor some final words to help him as they hugged goodbye.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor learns that he is still worthy of \nMjlnir\n \n \nBefore they could leave, Thor tried to summon \nMjlnir\n to see if he was still worthy. It took a moment but much to his delight, the hammer came to him, giving Thor the final reassurance that he could still do good despite how he would feel about himself. Thor then decided to take Mjlnir with him as he and Rocket returned to the present after bidding farewell to Frigga one last time.\n[\n22\n]\nNatasha Romanoff's Death\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThe \nAvengers\n mourn \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \n\"Why are we acting like \nshe\n's dead?

However, this was cut short when \nClint Barton\n fell to his knees, as everyone noticed that \nNatasha Romanoff\n was not there, understanding she did not survive the mission. Mourning the loss of their friend, the original Avengers all gathered outside.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor discusses \nNatasha Romanoff\n's death\n \n \nAfter \nTony Stark\n asked about whether Romanoff had any family they had to inform, Thor was confused by their acceptance of her death, believing that they could use the \nInfinity Stones\n to bring her back. He desperately tried to get them to agree with him, now trying to do right, but he was corrected by Barton who stated that she could not be brought back. However, Thor did not believe him due to his inexperience in \nmagical\n world.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor accepts \nNatasha Romanoff\n is dead\n \n \nHowever, Barton assured him that her \nsacrifice\n could not be undone, according to the \nStonekeeper\n, causing him to get angry and yell at Thor to go talk to him himself. This then put to rest Thor's hopes of bringing her back, causing him to once again be struck by more loss and pain that he was trying to overcome. After \nBruce Banner\n accepted her loss, they all decided to not let their friend's death go without meaning, so they began working on constructing a \nNano Gauntlet\n to contain the Stones.\n[\n22\n]\nThe \nBlip\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor volunteers to wield the \nNano Gauntlet\n \n \n\"We're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?\"\n\"We should at least discuss it.\"\n\"Sitting here, staring at the \nthing\n is not going to bring everybody back. I'm the strongest \nAvenger\n.\"\nThor and \nScott Lang\n[src]\nTony Stark\n, \nRocket\n and \nBruce Banner\n successfully forged a \nNano Gauntlet\n, leaving the only question as to who would snap their fingers. Thor, continuing his search for redemption, immediately volunteered to do it, but was met with strong refusal by everyone else.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor arguing with all of the other \nAvengers\n \n \nThor stated they could not waste time trying to decide who would do it, and that as the \"Strongest Avenger\", he should have filled the role. However, they continued to stop his attempts, which he desperately told them he wanted to do something right. But Stark informed him that not only was the power of the combined \nInfinity Stones\n too dangerous, but that he was in no condition to wield them.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor shields \nRocket\n from danger\n \n \nThor still tried to make his case but was stopped when Banner claimed that it had to be him. Banner informed them that none of them could survive, seeing the damage it did to \nThanos\n and that the radiation was mostly \ngamma\n, giving the possibility that he could. With Banner being the one to snap his fingers, the rest all suited up and stood around him as they \nlocked down\n the \nAvengers Compound\n. When Banner put the gauntlet on, Thor shielded Rocket in the event something went wrong.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor checking on \nBruce Banner\n's condition\n \n \nAs they watched Banner be affected by the gauntlet's power, Thor grew concerned and told them to get it off him, but Banner told them he was fine and proceeded. Banner was successfully able to snap his fingers, but it caused him to faint. They all gathered around him as Thor tried to comfort Banner, not sure if it had worked. Suddenly, they were \nattacked\n when the facility was bombed by \nThanos\n from \n2014\n, causing them all to be separated within the destroyed facility, Thor ending up with Stark and \nSteve Rogers\n.\n[\n22\n]\nBattling Another Thanos\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor observes \nThanos\n from the wreckage\n \n \n\"You know it's a trap, right?\"\n\"Yeah. I don't much care.\"\n\"Good. Just as long as we're all in agreement. Let's kill \nhim\n properly this time.\"\nThor and \nIron Man\n[src]\nAfter the attack ended, Thor made his way out of the wreckage that once was the \nAvengers Compound\n, where he noticed the alternate \nThanos\n sitting outside.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor with \nCaptain America\n and \nIron Man\n \n \nWhen he was joined by \nIron Man\n and \nCaptain America\n, he informed them that Thanos had been doing nothing, as they addressed that the location of the \nInfinity Stones\n were unknown and that Thanos did not have them. Thor told them that Thanos was waiting and there was clearly a trap for them, but Iron Man responded that he did not care, much to Thor's agreement.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor calls both \nMjlnir\n and \nStormbreaker\n \n \nPlanning to face Thanos, Thor then summoned a bolt of lightning, which provided him with \narmor\n, as well as calling upon both \nMjlnir\n and \nStormbreaker\n. He then expressed his desire to kill the \nTitan\n again, this time properly. They then made their way to the ground, where they started to approach Thanos, who began to talk about their \nfail\nures\n to stop him before, albeit the future version of him.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to battle \nThanos\n \n \nThe three then surrounded Thanos, as he continued to talk, explaining how despite \nhis\n plans to bring balance to the universe, complications would still present themselves, in this case the \nAvengers\n. Thanos then announced his goal of destroying the universe as it was and using the stones to create a new one; one that might have been truly grateful for the life he had given them. He then put on his \nhelmet\n as Thor channeled lightning through himself, preparing for the fight. Captain America objected to Thanos' plans, but he claimed that they would all be dead to be indifferent to it.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor uses his lightning to boost \nIron Man\n \n \nThey all then rushed the Titan, taking him on together, as he managed to fend them all off. The fight became more heated, despite their combined efforts to defeat him, as he was able to keep fighting. Iron Man then ordered Thor to charge him up with his lightning, which allowed him to blast multiple beams at Thanos, which he blocked. Thor then launched Mjlnir at Thanos by hitting it with Stormbreaker, which knocked Iron Man away from almost being ripped apart but rendering him unconscious.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor facing off with \nThanos\n \n \nThor then continued to face off against Thanos, rushing towards him until he was able to disarm him from his \nDouble-Edged Sword\n. However, Thanos, too, managed to disarm Thor and then began to throw the God of Thunder around, ruthlessly beating him. Pinned, Thor tried to summon Stormbreaker to defend himself, but Thanos snatched it in mid-air and tried to cut into Thor's chest with it.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nCaptain America\n wield \nMjlnir\n \n \nHowever, before he could finish Thor, Thanos was knocked away from him when Mjlnir struck the Mad Titan in the face. The two then discovered Captain America wielding Mjlnir, bringing delight to Thor as he had always suspected that he was worthy. However, Thanos then knocked Thor out, and proceeded to fight Captain America.\n[\n22\n]\nBattle of Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor charges towards \nThanos\n' entire army\n \n \n\"No, no, give me \nthat\n.

However, at the same time, numerous \nportals\n appeared opposite the army, with heroes, including those who died to the \nSnap\n, to help in the fight. As they all stood together, Thor summoned \nStormbreaker\n and flew to the assembled heroes, as \nCaptain America\n led the charge, with Thor letting out a loud battle cry.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights alongside \nCaptain America\n \n \nThor, along with everyone else, rushed towards Thanos' army, where he used Stormbreaker to defeat many enemies. Thor fought alongside Captain America, as the two briefly switched between using both of Thor's weapons, of which they were worthy of. However, after they cleared all enemies in their area, Thor, ending up with \nMjlnir\n, asked to switch with Captain America for Stormbreaker, as it was more powerful.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor tries to kill \nThanos\n with \nStormbreaker\n \n \nThor continued to fight in the epic battle, but when \nCaptain Marvel\n was stopped from returning the \nNano Gauntlet\n, Thor, \nIron Man\n and Captain America rushed over to stop Thanos from getting it. Thor fought Thanos off with both his weapons, and tried to get the Gauntlet, but could not keep Thanos away. With the assistance of Captain America, they tried to push Stormbreaker into the \nTitan\n, but he headbutted Thor, knocking him out, followed by Captain America, too.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sadly watches \nIron Man\n as he dies\n \n \nAfter a heated fight, Iron Man was able to steal the \nInfinity Stones\n off Thanos, and used them to wipe out the entire army, with Thanos soon following. However, this action ended up killing Iron Man, due to the power of the stones. Everyone then gathered around the fallen hero, where Thor sadly watched his friend in his final moments.\n[\n22\n]\n Following \nHawkeye\n, everyone then knelt before him, out of respect.\n[\n37\n]\nAs Thor had been wounded by Thanos during the battle, he spilled his blood on the battlefield, which was collected by \nNick Fury\n's secret \nSkrull\n unit and placed into a vial known as the \nHarvest\n alongside other enhanced DNA samples. The Harvest vial was later administered by Super-Skrulls \nGravik\n and \nG'iah\n, granting them access to Thor's physiology and abilities.\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nWithout a Path\n[\n]\nNew King of Asgard\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor attending the funeral of \nTony Stark\n \n \n\"Your \npeople\n need a king.\"\n\"No, they already have one.\"\n\nValkyrie\n and Thor\n[src]\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Thor attended the funeral for \nTony Stark\n, where he watched Stark's recorded message with his family, \nHappy Hogan\n, \nJames Rhodes\n and the remaining original \nAvengers\n. They all then went outside where he watched as \nPepper Potts\n and \nMorgan Stark\n placed Stark's \nArc Reactor\n on the lake. Thor stood alongside \nBruce Banner\n as they mourned the death of their friend and fellow Avenger.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor meeting with \nValkyrie\n at \nNew Asgard\n \n \nAfterwards, Thor, who had decided to take some time away, went back to \nNew Asgard\n, where he met with \nValkyrie\n on a cliff. She asked when he would return, which he alluded that he wouldn't be. Valkyrie reminded him that the \nAsgardians\n needed their king, which he agreed with; however, he noted that she was their leader, not him.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor appoints \nValkyrie\n as \nNew Asgard\n's king\n \n \nValkyrie initially thought Thor was joking, but he assured her that it was very much the case. He told her that he was not meant to be king, despite it being his birthright, and that he needed to find his true purpose. Valkyrie then took to Thor's words of her being a leader and accepted the role, promising that she would make changes.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor discusses his life with no current path\n \n \nThey then shook hands, as Valkyrie then asked what Thor would now be doing with his life. However, he was not able to respond, for once not knowing what he was to do with his life, having no path outside of \nAsgard\n. However, he had arranged with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n transportation, joining them on their travels, in hopes to discover a new path for his life.\n[\n22\n]\nJoining the Guardians\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor arriving on board the \nBenatar\n \n \n\"The \nAsgardians\n \nof the Galaxy\n, back together again.\"\nThor\n[src]\nThor then made his way to the \nBenatar\n after \nRocket\n called out to him while he was talking with \nValkyrie\n. Once he came on board, he reunited with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, mainly \nGroot\n, having spent more time with him before.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor becomes a new \nGuardian of the Galaxy\n \n \nHe then joined \nPeter Quill\n, asking their next destination, as he touched the map. Threatened, Quill moved the map back and reconfirmed that he was in charge, which Thor agreed with, subtly challenging it by moving the map back. Quill then called Thor out, but Thor acted completely compliant, but still undermining him by calling him \"Quail.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nThor challenging \nPeter Quill\n's leadership\n \n \nDrax\n then joined in and suggested that they fight each other for the honor of being the leader, which the other members supported. However, they both hesitantly declined the duel, laughing it off as Thor assured that everyone knew who was in charge. However, this was still concerning for Quill, who stated that it was him, which Thor agreed with as if allowing him.\n[\n22\n]\nGetting Back in Shape\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor working out\n \n \n\"Thor went from dad-bod to god-bod.\"\n\nKorg\n[src]\nThor continued his adventures with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n in the \nBenatar\n, in which they were joined by \nKraglin Obfonteri\n, who they welcomed into the team. They also were joined by \nKorg\n, who gave Thor a baseball cap, listing candidates for the Strongest \nAvenger\n, in which Thor crossed out the names except for his. He then decided to get back into physical activity and worked out.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor pulling the \nBenatar\n \n \nWhen they stopped at various planets, Thor would use the opportunity to exercise. On one planet, Thor pulled the \nBenatar\n for a long stretch. Eventually, Thor had regained his muscular body and lost the body fat he had gained. This improved his morale.\n[\n2\n]\nAdventures with the Guardians\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor continues to be a member of the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n \n \n\"He teamed up with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n and set off on some classic Thor adventures.\"\n\nKorg\n[src]\nNow with his muscular body back, Thor continued his adventures with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, responding to distress calls across the universe.

While there, he went to a hill and meditated quietly, placing \nStormbreaker\n in the dirt. His relaxation was interrupted when \nStar-Lord\n and \nMantis\n approached him and asked him to help them face \nHabooska the Horrible\n and his \narmy\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor prepares to face the \nBooskans\n \n \nThor then grabbed Stormbreaker and flew down to the ground, where he was asked by \nRocket\n of why he told them it was a holiday in which he stated it would have been like one. Thor was then approached by King \nYakan\n and the \nIndigarrians\n who were pleased he had come down from the hill. Thor gave them a speech and noted how he and the Guardians would save them. Yakun told Thor that Indigarr's gods had been murdered, surprising Thor.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting the \nBooskans\n \n \nThor then summoned Stormbreaker and went into the fight, engaging the Booskans. He used Stormbreaker to destroy their vehicles and then his lightening to kill them. He also used Stormbreaker to electrify the \nSacred Temple\n in order to kill Habooska, but accidentally destroyed the temple in the process.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor receives two \nIndigarrian Goats\n \n \nAs thanks from Yakan for saving his people, Thor received two \nIndigarrian Goats\n named \nToothgrinder\n and \nToothgnasher\n, which he considered beautiful, even though Yakan gave them to him as punishment for destroying the temple, and Thor thanked him for the gift while trying to apologize for the accidental destruction.\n[\n2\n]\nConflict with Gorr\n[\n]\nLearning about the God Butcher\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor inside the \nBenatar\n \n \n\"The \nGod Butcher\n is coming.

However, the goats caused problems inside, leading to \nNebula\n and \nMantis\n wanting to put them down. Thor prevented that, just as \nKraglin Obfonteri\n walked in with an \nIndigarrian woman\n he had married.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and the \nGuardians\n look at the distress calls\n \n \nAs \nPeter Quill\n gave Obfonteri a hard time, Thor was alerted to countless distress calls on the monitor. They gathered around and observed as several gods were attacked, showing corpses of some. One call flashed by, which was of \nSif\n, and Thor asked Quill to go back to it. She asked for his help in the call stating that a \nGod Butcher\n was on the loose, leading Thor to become saddened again.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor speaks with \nPeter Quill\n \n \nHe walked away from the others and went outside, where Quill followed. Despite his reluctance to part ways with them, Thor was given advice by Quill on leaving his heart open to feel love even if that meant losing it, noting how he had lost his \nlove\n. Thor explained that he had been in love before and that it had ended in a handwritten note. Thor then stated he would go find Sif while they answer the other calls.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor says goodbye to the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n \n \nThe rest of the Guardians soon walked out, as Thor exchanged a handshake with Quill. Thor then stated he would give Quill the ship as a parting gift, leading Quill to remind him it was his ship to begin with. Thor then said his goodbyes to \nRocket\n, \nGroot\n, \nDrax\n, Nebula and Mantis, before Quill ordered Obfonteri to start the ship.

He then prepared to utilize the \nBifrost Bridge\n, bringing the goats and Korg with him.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nFalligar the Behemoth\n's corpse\n \n \nAfter arriving in \nAlfheim\n, Thor discovered his fellow god, \nFalligar the Behemoth\n's corpse. Upset by this, Thor then saw Sif lying on the ground by Falligar. Worried, Thor flew over and spoke with her, noting that her arm was severed. Sif told him she wanted to go to \nValhalla\n, but he reminded her she survived and couldn't yet.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor talks to \nSif\n \n \nAfter telling Lady Sif that the only way she can go ahead now is to stay alive, he told her to go with him back to New Asgard. Thor was then warned by Sif about a god-butcher named Gorr, who was hunting out all gods across the universe in the aspirations to kill all of them, identifying him as the one who killed Falligar and injured Lady Sif, telling him that Gorr would attack \nNew Asgard\n next.

Thor used Stormbreaker to fight; however, he saw \nMjlnir\n flying around, wanting to get it back. Thor then asked Mjlnir to come back to him; however, it came to \nMighty Thor\n, much to Thor's bewilderment as he saw her wielding \nMjlnir\n and dressed exactly like him.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is shocked to see \nJane Foster\n \n \nThor demanded that she reveal herself, so Mighty Thor removed her \nWinged Helmet\n, shocking Thor to be seeing his ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster. Completely taken aback, Thor tried to understand how she had gained his powers, but Mighty Thor insisted they talk later, as they were in the middle of a fierce battle. When Thor came up against \nGorr the God Butcher\n, Foster and \nValkyrie\n came to his support, so Gorr retreated. They discovered that the children had been taken by Gorr, so Mighty Thor and Thor went to save them, but he escaped before they could reach them.\n[\n2\n]\nHeading to Omnipotence City\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nMighty Thor\n \n \n\"What's \nOmnipotence City\n?\"\n\"It's home to the most powerful gods in the universe. We could pull together the greatest team ever.\"\n\nJane Foster\n and Thor\n[src]\nMighty Thor flew around the \nEarth\n twice looking for the children but was unable to find any trace of them. When she returned to New Asgard to report her findings, she and Thor talked about how long it had been since they saw each other, with Foster not thinking it was as long due to being gone for five years from the \nSnap\n. Thor recounted how Foster only left him a note when they broke up, but Foster countered that Thor had already left her before the note, so they agreed that they both left and got left by the other.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor and \nJane Foster\n leave \nNew Asgard\n \n \nWith the children gone, the \nAsgardians\n gathered in panic over what to do to get them back. Thor announced that he would rescue the children himself, but when he went to summon the \nBifrost Bridge\n, he ended up crashing outside, so \nValkyrie\n called everyone away so she could make a plan with Foster, Thor and \nKorg\n. Knowing that Gorr's strength would have been at its peak there, Thor, Mighty Thor, Valkyrie and Korg traveled to \nOmnipotence City\n to warn \nZeus\n of Gorr and ask for an army to help fight him.\n[\n2\n]\nEscape from Omnipotence City\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor talks to \nValkyrie\n \n \n\"Is this the purpose of the gods? To hide away in a \ngolden palace\n like cowards? Maybe we have lost our way. You know what? We'll stop \nhim\n ourselves.\"\n\"I am afraid I cannot allow that.\"\nThor and \nZeus\n[src]\nThe group used \nAsgardian Skiffs\n to fly to \nOmnipotence City\n. Once there, \nMighty Thor\n talked to Thor, showing off her possible catchphrases which Thor thought they were funny. Once Foster went ahead, \nValkyrie\n talked to Thor about Foster. However, Thor claimed that he did not have feelings for her.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor in \nOmnipotence City\n \n \nArriving at the meeting of the gods, Thor attempted to disguise himself with his cape, very proud of his style choice. Valkyrie then arrived with actual disguises, having taken them off of the emotion gods. They walked in and Thor marveled at the gods that were displayed. When \nZeus\n arrived, Thor grew very excited and cheered on Zeus. Valkyrie wanted to fight, but Thor assured her his belief that he could talk to Zeus. Zeus then called everybody out, asking who was talking. \nKorg\n stupidly pointed at Thor, leading to Zeus to make him go onto the stage in front of everyone.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor's clothes get flicked off\n \n \nZeus flicked off Thor's disguise too forcefully, ripping off all of Thor's clothes and leaving him exposed naked in front of the crowd. An angry Thor then demanded Zeus' help, but he refused. Thor called him scared, so Zeus marched down to Thor and whispered. Zeus admitted that he was scared as \nGorr the God Butcher\n had the \nAll-Black the Necrosword\n. However, he also did not want to panic, so he was not going to help. Thor then asked for \nThunderbolt\n. Zeus threw it around, displaying it for the crowd before saying no. Zeus also explained that Thor could not leave as he could lure Gorr to them.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights the \nSpartans\n \n \nValkyrie then asked if they could do her plan. Thor agreed, so a fight commenced. Thor fought all of the \nSpartans\n, grabbing Korg's hammer and slamming it onto a guard. The group fought some more until Zeus had enough and threw Thunderbolt at Korg, seemingly killing him. Zeus then called out Thor before throwing his Thunderbolt again. Thor grabbed the Thunderbolt, charged it with lightning, and threw it back at Zeus, impaling him. Thor ran to the crumpled rocks, sad about his friend. Suddenly, Korg's voice came out from the pile. Apparently, the only live part of the \nKronan\n was the face, so Korg remained alive. The group then grabbed the Thunderbolt and left.\n[\n2\n]\nHeading to the Shadow Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor talks to \nStormbreaker\n \n \n\"I wanna be with you, Jane. What do you say?\"\n\"I have cancer.\"\nThor and \nJane Foster\n[src]\nBack on the \nAsgardian Skiff\n, Thor used \nAxl Heimdallson\n to talk to the kids. He told them about how he vanquished \nZeus\n and they were going to be saved soon. His connection was interrupted when \nValkyrie\n tickled his nose with her hair. Thor then gave Valkyrie the \nThunderbolt\n as he heard \nStormbreaker\n getting mad. He then walked out to Stormbreaker and tried to talk to it, even pouring beer onto the axe.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor finds out about the cancer\n \n \nJane Foster\n then walked out to Thor and they talked about their relationship. Thor said that he wanted someone to make him feel shitty. Foster then blurted out that she had cancer, surprising and worrying Thor. She then immediately took it back, claiming she was lying. Thor grew serious as they talked about her condition before kissing once again. They were interrupted by Valkyrie who walked out saying they were at the \nMoon of Shame\n. The color started turning black and white as they arrived.\n[\n2\n]\nAmbush at the Shadow Realm\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor holds \nJane Foster\n's hand\n \n \n\"You know nothing of being a god.\"\n\"You went to the gods for help, and they did nothing. We're alike in that sense.\"\nThor and \nGorr the God Butcher\n[src]\nThey crashed into the \nMoon of Shame\n and tried to find the kids. Inside \nGorr the God Butcher\n's hut was plans. Suddenly, \nMighty Thor\n summoned \nStormbreaker\n and threw it into the sky. Thor asked her why she would do that and she explained it was a trap as the axe was the key to open the \nGates of Eternity\n. Gorr then arrived and tied everyone up in tentacles.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor taunts \nGorr the God Butcher\n \n \nGorr got close to Thor, telling him to summon the axe, but Thor told him he would when Gorr went to a dentist. Gorr then pulled the tentacles tighter, incapacitating Thor even more. Gorr then started talking about love as he pulled tighter on Foster. He told Thor to choose love. Seeing Foster getting strangled to death, Thor summoned Stormbreaker which crashed into the moon, causing them to get sprung up in the rubble.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor blasts \nGorr the God Butcher\n \n \nThey regrouped on the surface as Gorr shadow teleported around them. Gorr silently told Thor to give him the axe, but Thor taunted him back. He then blasted Gorr with lightning, which was blocked by the \nAll-Black the Necrosword\n. They worked together to fight until Valkyrie was stabbed by Gorr. Thor yelled out to Valkyrie as Foster said they needed to go. Thor summoned the \nBifrost Bridge\n only for Stormbreaker to get grabbed. Thor struggled to hold onto the axe as the force of the Bifrost was pulling him away. His grip slipped as he was summoned away without Stormbreaker.\n[\n2\n]\nJane Foster's Health\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor kisses \nJane Foster\n goodbye\n \n \n\"I've always loved you. And this is a chance for us. But if you pick up that damn \nhammer\n again, then that chance is gone. It's your choice, Jane. But I'd regret it every single day if I didn't ask you to stay here so we could try and figure this out together.\"\nThor to \nJane Foster\n[src]\nThor, \nJane Foster\n and a very injured \nValkyrie\n dropped down in \nNew Asgard\n. Thor looked up to find a sick Foster trying to grab \nMjlnir\n as she returned to her mortal form. With two threats now looming, Thor chose love and stayed with Foster. He brought her to the emergency room where the doctor told him that Mjlnir happened to drain her mortal strength, which enabled her to fight the cancer. Thor angrily punched the vending machine.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor is given the \nThunderbolt\n \n \nThor returned to Foster's room and gave her a bunch of food, claiming that there was a refrigerator without a door. He then talked to Foster and told her the news about her fate. He told her that he did not want her to fight anymore, but she reassured him it was okay, and she wanted to. Thor still refused, but she argued it was her choice. Thor professed his love to her before agreeing it was her choice. So, he left Mjlnir with her, saying that she should've chosen her own fate. He then met with Valkyrie outside, who lost an organ. She gave Thor \nThunderbolt\n, which Thor used to teleport to the center of the universe where \nEternity\n was located.\n[\n2\n]\nStopping Gorr's Quest\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor gives his power to the \nAsgardian\n children\n \n \n\"General \nAxl\n... Lead your army to that \naxe\n.\"\n\"We shall do our worst. For \nAsgard\n.\"\nThor and \nAxl Heimdallson\n[src]\nThor arrived at the \nGates of Eternity\n and found the children there with \nGorr the God Butcher\n. However, he was too late as Gorr already was using \nStormbreaker\n to open up the gate. Thor enlisted help of the children. He asked if they knew how to fight and then used \nThunderbolt\n to enchant the children with the power of Thor. This gave the children incredible strength and powers, enough to fight the \nShadow Monsters\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor witnesses \nJane Foster\n join the fight\n \n \nThor leaped at the Shadow Monsters and fought them before running to Gorr, whom he fought using Thunderbolt until Gorr managed to pin Thor to the ground, trying to plunge his blade into Thor. Suddenly, he was hit by \nMjlnir\n. Thor looked up to find \nMighty Thor\n arriving with \nWarsong\n. Thor sadly voiced his displeasure, but Foster nodded at him as if to say she made her choice. Thor then fought Gorr with Foster.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights against \nGorr the God Butcher\n \n \nThey exchanged blows with Thor dismantling Thunderbolt temporarily to block an attack. He then ran over to Stormbreaker and tried to get it to break free, but was unable to. He finally did so after many struggling tries. He then threw it towards \nAxl Heimdallson\n, who used it to get everyone home. Thor looked over to see Foster, who had broken the \nAll-Black the Necrosword\n. She looked at him before summoning Mjlnir, which gathered up the sword pieces as it returned, inhibiting the hammer.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor sees \nGorr\n enter the \nGates of Eternity\n \n \nShe then summoned lightning, which destroyed the hammer and the sword, turning it into dust as Gorr screamed. Thor ran over to the now mortal Foster, who struggled to stay on her feet. Even though she was dying, she told Thor to stop Gorr, who was stumbling into the gate. Thor did not worry about that as he wanted to stay with Foster.\n[\n2\n]\nChoosing Love\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor offers \nGorr the God Butcher\n a choice\n \n \n\"You've won, Gorr. Why would I spend my last moments with you when I can be with \nher\n? I choose love. You can, too. You can bring \nher\n back. Make your wish.\"\nThor to \nGorr the God Butcher\n[src]\nAs \nGorr the God Butcher\n entered through the gate, Thor and \nJane Foster\n were also sent to a \nwell\n-like place. He talked to Gorr just before he made his wish. However, Gorr was surprised that Thor was not going to stop him and stopped. Thor explained that Gorr already won, so he should make his choice. However, Thor chose love and Gorr should have too. He then walked over to Foster and held her. Gorr decided Thor was right and did choose love.\n \n \n \n \n \nThor holds the dying \nJane Foster\n \n \nThor watched as Gorr's daughter, \nLove\n emerged and walked over to the dying Gorr. Gorr was heartbroken to see his daughter, but knew he was dying. Foster then told Gorr that Thor would take care of her. Thor agreed as Gorr perished. Thor then looked to foster, who smiled at him as she died and went to \nValhalla\n, leaving just Thor and Love.\n[\n2\n]\nA New Purpose\n[\n]\nRaising Love\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \n\"\nLove\n and Thunder\" jumping into battle\n \n \n\"Got it. Protect the nice ones.\"\n\"I love you, sweetie.\"\n\"Love you, Uncle Thor.\"\n\nLove\n and Thor\n[src]\nThor trained \nLove\n in combat and entrusted the \nStormbreaker\n to her. Love joined Thor in battle many times, where they eventually became known as simply Love and Thunder. She drew a smiley face on Thor's weapon \nMjlnir\n, which Thor reluctantly agreed made the weapon look better. Thor tried to serve pancakes for breakfast, but she did not like them. As they prepared for battle, they had an argument because she wanted to wear slippers while he wanted her to wear boots, and she tried to blast him with optic beams. He got his way, and she wore the boots. Thor reminded her that they had a responsibility to defend the weak, and they charged out to defend an alien race from an invading army.\n[\n2\n]\nDeadpool's Sacrifice\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor cries over \nDeadpool\n \n \n\"Is that me? Is that Thor? Is he crying?\"\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. That happens in the distant future.\"\n\nDeadpool\n and \nMr. Paradox\n[src]\nThor eventually found himself back on \nSvartalfheim\n with a \nmutant\n known as \nDeadpool\n. Deadpool got very injured to the point where his mask was broken in half. Thor looked down upon Deadpool much like he did \nmany years before\n with \nLoki\n and wept over Deadpool's body.\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"I'm tired of giving myself over to the idea of fate and trying to figure out what the universe wants from me. I wanna live in the moment, I wanna live like there's no tomorrow, throw caution to the wind.\"\nThor to \nMighty Thor\n[src]\nBefore his banishment to \nEarth\n, Thor was initially conceited, arrogant, immature and stubborn. He had proven to be bloodthirsty and enjoyed the challenge of battle and combat, \nLaufey\n even stated on \nJotunheim\n that he craved war, with the \nFrost Giants\n in particular, due to being Odin's own wars with them convincing him that they were vicious monsters. This bloodlust began as early as his childhood, with Thor then jesting that he'd hunt down the Frost Giants and slay them all if he became king. His adoptive brother \nLoki\n even commented that Thor would have killed the entire race of Frost Giants with his bare hands as an adult. However, it should be noted that Thor still had some honorable traits, as he notably supported his friend \nSif\n in her goals to become a great warrior, while most others would not take her seriously. In his heart, he only wishes to live up to the expectations of his father to become a great king but, in truth, he did have difficulty finding the difference between a ruler and a warrior and what makes each a good man.\nThor was quick to anger and could act rashly to a situation such as when \nAsgard\n was broken into; his first instinct was to attack the Jotuns to dissuade them to ever do a similar stunt again. Later on, he, Sif and the \nWarriors Three\n launched an all-out attack on \nJotunheim\n, ignoring the fact that they'd be sorely outnumbered which seemed to stem from arrogance, although at the time he only went to achieve answers on how they infiltrated Asgard. When the Frost Giants had ruined his coronation, he reacted by angrily flipping over a table and finally when he was later insulted by a Frost Giant on Jotunheim, Thor reacted by promptly decapitating the former with \nMjlnir\n and started a fight with the other Frost Giants.\nBecause he hails from royalty and has spent several centuries off Earth since last, Thor was out of place on Midgard as his boisterous personality was often part of his charm on Asgard and he was unaware of Earth's customs and rules. For example, when he broke a cup of a drink he liked while yelling \"other\" (thinking it was appropriate on Earth), he asked for a horse at a pet store (that was because when he last visited Midgard humanity was still using horses to a great extent) and walked in the middle of a street. His vocabulary and endearments were also outdated and out of place in modern times, he was trapped inside, mystifying everyone around him into thinking he was delusional even though it was simply the way people talked about Asgard. After returning to arrest Loki, Thor seemed to gain tact, but still believed that Bilgesnipe existed on Earth. Also, Thor was initially shown to be quite vain and selfish. For example, as doctors and guards held him down in a hospital, he described himself as \"powerful.\" He was also flabbergasted when he found himself content only to state in disbelief that \"it's not possible\" since he never lost a battle beforehand with his divine powers.\nWhen his irresponsibility and arrogance placed his home Asgard and the \nNine Realms\n in danger, his father, \nOdin\n, banished Thor to Earth and stripped him of all his powers. That, in addition to him discovering that he was no longer worthy of Mjlnir's power, put Thor into a state of depression. This, along with Loki lying that Odin died, humbled him greatly and during his time on Midgard, fell in love with the human \nJane Foster\n which finally taught him the humility and wisdom he was lacking. Hence, after his adoptive brother Loki sent the \nDestroyer\n to kill him, Thor defended the Warriors Three and the townspeople of New Mexico and selflessly gave up his own life for the town, thereby finally becoming worthy of Mjlnir again. After regaining his power, Thor would take too often holding back his great powers, unless battling an opponent of equivalent strength and durability, which Thor notably held back in all of his duels with Loki, believing that \"[his] brother was still in there somewhere.\"\nThor, however, did still appear to be somewhat hot-tempered, as when he met with \nIron Man\n for the first time, the two battled in the woods, with Thor then proceeding to charge at \nCaptain America\n, when the latter intervened. However, he quickly came to see that he and the other \nAvengers\n were fighting for the same cause and befriended them, notably saving \nBlack Widow\n from an enraged \nHulk\n.\nAt this time, Thor would become far more responsible than before, since as soon as the \nBifrost\n was regenerated by energy from the \nTesseract\n, Thor took it upon himself to safeguard the worlds of the \nNine Realms\n that had fallen into chaos and conflict in the \nAsgardians\n' absence. Following losing Foster after the Bifrost destruction, Thor also became somewhat somber and Sif herself noticed this personality shift from how he used to celebrate all night long to simply staring idly at the ongoing feast of his friends. Thor has learned from his mistakes and grown to such lengths that he surpassed Loki and even Odin. He was willing to commit treason and spare his enemies if it was honorable as he destroyed the Bifrost to spare Jotunheim and free Loki, going against the Allfather by taking the Aether to Svartalfheim to destroy Malekith as Odin's way would have resulted in countless of Asgardians' death.\nWhile Thor was destined to become the King of \nAsgard\n, however, he eventually realized that he couldn't actively protect the \nNine Realms\n from the throne, and selflessly denied his birthright, even offering Mjlnir to (who he thought was) \nOdin\n. After helping the \nAvengers\n defeat \nUltron\n, Thor temporarily left his friends, taking it upon himself to find the rest of the \nInfinity Stones\n and learn the identity of the \nultimate enemy\n.\nWhatever remained of Thor's boastful personality has seemingly vanished since Odin's death and Hela destroying Mjlnir. Without an object to channel his supernatural powers, even though he retained his immense superhuman might, and with the guilt of having failed to save his father, Thor believed he was worthless which made any remains of arrogance that he had completely disappear, as can be seen with his interactions towards people have become more awkward and overly-excitable such as when he realized that Brunnhilde was a Valkyrie on Sakaar, he tried to explain and convince her to join him rather than ordering her like he would have done with any other Asgardians. Nevertheless, while Thor's arrogance had disappeared fully, he still remains utmostly confident and assured in his abilities as a warrior, as can be witnessed when he told Grandmaster to \"point [him] in the direction of whoever's ass [he had] to kick,\" despite his champion being praised as a savage opponent. The knowledge of how Asgard really rose to power farther humbled Thor even more, as he was shocked and dismayed of his father's war seeking past. Although his love and respect for Odin remained as high as ever, he has come to accept that Odin's darker nature indirectly caused Ragnarok and openly admitted that Odin had flaws in his own right, even saying that Hela had a right to be angry with Odin. Though Thor has mostly unlocked the full magnitude of his powers since Asgard's destruction and Hela's defeat there still remains an awkwardness to his character, especially when compared to his previous personality. During his original coronation, he yelled uproariously towards his subjects in a victorious manner but when ascending to King of Asgard he only awkwardly waved to the Asgardians behind him.\nAfter Thanos attacked and massacred half of his kind, with only he himself as the only known survivor of the half that was slaughtered by Thanos, and witnessing Loki's death, Thor was greatly saddened and left furious by having lost his brother who he had just reconciled with and the deaths of the Asgardians and gained a strong desire to kill Thanos to avenge his people and brother, which he vowed to do so to the Titan, although Thanos was not fazed and simply taunted him that Loki is truly dead. Out of all the deaths of the Asgardians, Thor is particularly riddled with grief and anger over the deaths of his family and to a lesser degree, Heimdall, who Thor considered his best friend, and he lamented the fact that he is the sole survivor and only surviving legacy of the Asgardian Royal Family so strongly that he showed some sadness when talking to Hela, who had ruthlessly tried to kill him and even cried upon talking about Odin, Frigga and Loki. Although he retains much of his old personality, Thor has become noticeably more somber and sullen. He also seems to have gained a new perspective on why he had prevailed over the countless enemies he faced, as rather than saying it was due to his immense power and prowess as a warrior, Thor somewhat humbly said to Rocket that he believed he is only alive because fate wants it. His resentment for Thanos even made him about to attack Gamora when he learned she is Thanos' daughter, although he remains fully reasonable even with those connected to Thanos, as he went as far as to calmly talk about his own family problems with her. Having nothing more to lose, Thor valiantly and did everything he could to kill Thanos to avenge his people and family, with him going as far as to single-handedly bravely confront and wound Thanos with Stormbreaker, coming the closest to winning against Thanos. He even showed some sadism when he mocked Thanos that he had ignored Thor's promise to kill him and that caused him to be now seemingly beaten, having intentionally intended to wound Thanos first and gloat before killing him, but this proved to be a fatal mistake that Thor would deeply regret, as the blow was not sufficient to hinder Thanos, who successfully utilized the brief moment to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe and escape, causing Thor to not only be mocked once again by Thanos, who remained calm even after being wounded but also fail to avenge his people and brother as well as losing more of his friends.\nFollowing the \nSnap\n, Thor found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that his fatal mistake had resulted in the destruction of half the universe's life forms. He retained a glimmer of hope, however, and immediately voted in favor of \nCarol Danvers\n' plan to claim the \nInfinity Stones\n and bring everyone back. During the confrontation, he actually seemed to have taken the Mad Titan's taunts to heart, immediately cutting off the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n to prevent him from utilizing it. However, upon discovering that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones his wounds only deepened with shame and remorse and he killed the Mad Titan without hesitation shortly afterwards, finally avenging the deaths of his people. However, this brought Thor no semblance of peace at all.\nEven five years after Thanos' death, Thor still continued to be haunted by his failure to stop the Titan and suffered in the belief that he had not been able to embody the qualities of an ideal king that had been imbued into him throughout his entire childhood. Still, he unsuccessfully tried to keep up a faade of still being his former self and initially refused to assist in the \nTime Heist\n. However, all this changed upon seeing his mother, \nFrigga\n, again, who told him he had indeed failed and that this made him just like anyone else; finally lifting the burden of having to be an ideal king from his shoulders.\nDuring the \nBattle of Earth\n, Thor bravely faced \nThanos\n alongside his fellow Avengers, displaying no signs of his previous anger towards the Titan. After the Battle, Thor seems to have returned to his former-self and decided to pursue a voyage of self-discovery. He also ceded the throne of \nNew Asgard\n to \nBrunnhilde\n, having made peace with the fact he is not a leader. After taking in \nLove\n as his adoptive daughter, Thor took it upon himself to teach her the way of the warrior and hero. Thor is also learning to be a good parent to Love and not to make the same mistakes his own father has made.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"I'm not as strong as you.\"\n\"No. You're stronger.\"\nThor and \nOdin\n[src]\nAsgardian Physiology\n: As an \nAsgardian\n, Thor possesses incredible supernatural powers and superhuman attributes far surpassing many others of his species, with only his father and older sister being his superior in power. With the death of \nOdin\n and \nHela\n, Thor is currently the most powerful Asgardian within the Nine Realms and the cosmos. As Asgard's warrior prince, Thor trained in the arts of battle, which he has practiced for thousands of years. He is recognized as relying solely on his superior fighting ability, strength, and nigh-invulnerability. Following his banishment to \nEarth\n, Thor greatly withholds his power unless fighting someone with similar strength and durability. Due to his immense powers and disciplined perspective, Thor often has to hold back during a fight due to the destruction his strength may cause to his surroundings, such as his fight on the \nHelicarrier\n with \nHulk\n, but even then he was still easily powerful enough to overpower multiple superhuman enemies and even overpower or at least contend with powerful beings such as Hulk and \nLoki\n. When he does let loose with his powers, Thor is capable of decimating much of his surroundings, such as when he shattered an entire ice shelf during a battle on \nJotunheim\n, and defeating a foe being empowered by an Infinity Stone, such as \nMalekith\n. After getting his full powers, Thor became powerful enough to contend with the true first-born of Odin and his older sister Hela. Odin implied that Thor has the potential to surpass him in the future. Wielding \nStormbreaker\n, Thor was the one of the three heroes who made a successful attempt at hurting \nThanos\n with the other three being \nWanda\n and \nCaptain Marvel\n, with Thanos himself suggesting that if Thor hit him in the head with Stormbreaker he might have been able to kill him. However, despite the great capabilities Thor possesses, neglecting his condition can extract a heavy toll on his power. This was evidenced when after 5 years of depression and an unhealthy lifestyle, Thor even using both \nMjlnir\n and Stormbreaker at the same time, was still overpowered by an \nInfinity Stones\n deprived \nThanos\n. Nevertheless, Thor did prove to be more of a challenge than most of the heroes who tried to face Thanos.\nSuperhuman Strength\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor pulling a flying \nBenatar\n \n \n As an Asgardian, specifically the son of \nOdin\n, Thor is the third strongest Asgardian of his time, only surpassed by Odin and \nHela\n, and with their deaths, he is now the strongest Asgardian alive. His incredible high-level of superhuman strength enables him to easily overpower hordes of \nHumans\n, Enhanced Humans, \nAsgardians\n, \nFrost Giants\n, \nChitauri\n, \nMarauders\n, \nDark Elves\n, \nUltron Sentries\n, \nOutriders\n and various other species within or beyond the \nNine Realms\n. He can lift or move immensely heavy objects effortlessly, such as when he was able to easily catch a falling car with one arm during \nBattle of Sokovia\n, saving the family trapped inside it, and flip a large, wide ceremonial table over on \nAsgard\n. He can also easily crush extremely durable objects, such as \nIron Man\n's gauntlets. Thor's strength extends to his ability to leap great distances. With his strength, Thor is able to take on multiple enemies at the same time, using \nMjlnir\n to send large groups of enemies, like the Frost Giants, the \nChitauri\n or \nUltron Sentries\n flying with each strike. Using his weapon Mjlnir, Thor's strength is compounded, as he is able to swing his mighty hammer with great speed and force. Thor's strength is so great, that he can throw his hammer with enough force to break through nearly any barrier. Thor was also strong enough to overpower the \nDestroyer\n, which had overwhelmed the likes of \nSif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n combined. Notably, he kicked Loki with enough force to shatter glass, lifted his brother off the ground and slammed him with enough force to stun him in their second duel. He also effortlessly overpowered Iron Man in his Mark VI despite it being empowered by Thor's electricity. His strength is so great that strikes with Mjlnir are usually fatal, knocking out opponents with one hit. Only beings of incredible power, like the \nDestroyer\n, \nHulk\n, \nMalekith\n, \nKurse\n, \nUltron\n, \nSurtur\n, \nHela\n, \nThanos\n, \nalternate Thanos\n and \nGorr\n can take multiple direct hits from Thor. Hence, Thor was able to shatter a massive \nKronan Stone Man\n, take down a \nLeviathan\n and even break the \nRainbow Bridge\n, all with only several blows of his hammer. Thor's immense strength combined with \nMjlnir\n also enabled him to break out of an extremely durable confinement capsule which was specifically designed to hold the Hulk. Using his immense strength, Thor was able to block a crushing blow from Hulk with his own arm and even punch the latter in the face hard enough to make him stagger. Thor also managed to match \nMalekith\n, whose strength was greatly compounded by the \nAether\n, equally and eventually overpower him. According to \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, Thor is able to \"crack\" the \nVibranium\n core itself with his raw strength alone. He later managed to overpower a weakened Surtur, killing him with a fully-powered hammer blow to the head. During the \nContest of Champions\n, Thor's strength and considerable fighting skill allowed him to dominate against Hulk, capable of staggering Hulk with his punches alone and sending him flying across the arena with a single hammer blow as well as even restraining him, only being overpowered by Hulk's growing anger and surprise attacks. After receiving visions from \nOdin\n's spirit, Thor's strength and fighting skill combined with his newfound ability to generate lightning allowed him to instantly topple and daze the angered \nHulk\n with a single punch that visibly dazed him. When he fought Hela, although he was ultimately no match for the more powerful Goddess of Death, Thor's physical strength and skill still allowed him to put up a reasonable fight on his own against Hela, who had single-handedly killed the \nValkyries\n, among the most powerful warriors of Asgard, managing to slightly stagger her with his punches and inflict minor injuries and briefly pressure her with Gungnir. Thor was also able to easily rip apart several Berserkers with his bare hands and contend with Hela during their final battle, managing to lift her off her feet and throw her to Valkyrie, fighting her to a prolonged standstill alongside Valkyrie. While attempting to restart the forge, Thor was able to easily swing around \nRocket\n's \nBenatar\n \nescape pod\n at great speeds and physically holding against the force necessary to move the gigantic rings of Nidavellir, which encircled the neutron star. He also was able to hold open the iris of \nNidavellir\n's star long enough for Eitri to melt ingots of metal that would become \nStormbreaker\n, as well as throw the axe with enough force that, combined with his powers, it was able to slice through a beam from the completed Infinity Gauntlet, and lodge deep into Thanos' chest, as well as cause him great pain upon pushing the axe deeper. During the Battle of Wakanda, Thor overpowered an army of Outriders to save the lives of the Avengers and Wakandan soldiers as well as destroying several Outriders' armored \nships\n with relative ease.\n[\n6\n]\n Even when he became fat, Thor's strength was still immense, as he was capable of grappling with the likes of Thanos for a brief period of time, as Thanos had to use both hands to overpower Thor's attempts to stop him from stabbing him with his own axe and he was able to hold long enough for \nCaptain America\n to save him. With both Stormbreaker and Mjlnir in his hand when he attempted to decapitate \nThanos\n again, he was gradually able to overpower the one-hand holding Mad \nTitan\n, coming very close to succeeding, eventually forcing Thanos to use both his hands and sudden momentum to knock him down. In addition to Thor's high-level strength, a full-power hammer throw aided by Stormbreaker was strong enough to knock out Iron Man in his strongest armor. In order to return to shape, Thor casually lifted numerous heavy weights, effortlessly tossing a large piece of rock away after finishing, using large dumbbells with ease and even moving the Benatar with a rope tied to it while showing little strain. After he returned to shape, Thor was able to easily cut through the ships of the Booskans with regular blows from Stormbreaker and even at one point kick it with enough force to damage it beyond operation and with little trouble hold back and throw one of them flying at him through a remarkable distance. During the skirmish at Omnipotence City, Thor effortlessly ripped out the lightning chains that Zeus used to bind him, and exerted enough force with sheer punches and kicks to easily kill the guards of the Omnipotence City. He also caught the \nThunderbolt\n thrown by \nZeus\n without issue and, with only some lightning empowering his attack, he was able to throw it with sufficient velocity and strength as to catch Zeus completely off-guard and easily pierce through his chest before stopping at the window, almost killing him. Thor also displayed equal strength to the \nAll-Black the Necrosword\n-augmented \nGorr the God Butcher\n in strength, who had successfully killed and overpowered many Gods, being able to send him flying repeatedly with swings from his axe, even at one point lift and throw him away with a single hand, and prevent him from stabbing him with his sword. Only a few beings were able to overpower Thor, including Hela, Odin and Thanos.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor enduring the energy of a neutron star\n \n \n Thor's skin, muscle and bone tissue have many times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being, making him nigh-invulnerable, much more so than regular Asgardians to the point that \nGamora\n claimed that Thor's muscles felt as if they were \"made of \nCotati\n metal fibers\". Even when he was stripped of his powers, Thor was still amazingly resilient due to his dense body, withstanding being hit by a van with ease, and only being seemingly killed by a punch from the \nDestroyer\n. When he is at full power, Thor possesses nigh-invulnerability, including high resistance to powerful energy blasts, immense blunt force trauma, falls from great heights, explosions and various other opposing forces. He was unharmed and unaffected by the vacuum of space for indefinite periods of time unaided. He withstood high caliber bullets from the \nQuinjet\n that was flown by Ultron without any injury, the extreme cold of \nJotunheim\n, the extreme heat of \nMuspelheim\n, survived a direct near point-blank range blast from \nGungnir\n blasting him out of \nOdin\n's chamber and falling several hundred feet to the ground, showing no visible signs of injury. Thor easily withstood a four hundred percent-charged repulsor blast from \nIron Man\n, was completely uninjured by \nQuicksilver\n smashing into him at extreme speeds, took a mighty punch from \nHulk\n with only a minor nosebleed, and even withstood the full force of the \nDestroyer\n's energy explosion with no visible injury. During his final battle with \nMalekith\n, Thor was even able to survive being hit by numerous energy tendrils of the \nReality Stone\n. Whenever he is injured, Thor's physique allows him to shrug off minor injuries such as small stab wounds from Asgardian blades or allow him to withstand a direct blow in the face from a massive Frost Giant and laugh afterwards. He resisted the direct destruction of the city of Novi Grad followed by a one-kilometer drop in the sea and was only momentarily unconscious. However, his durability would not prevent equally or even stronger foes like \nHulk\n, \nKurse\n, \nUltron\n, weakened \nSurtur\n, \nHela\n or \nThanos\n from wounding him. Nevertheless, Thor's own durability could still allow him to withstand their strength and power for quite some time before he started to drop in power and be injured, as he withstood a severe beating from Kurse, Ultron and Hela, notably surviving being stabbed with her \nNecroswords\n, which easily killed not only the \nEinherjar\n with a single hit but also the \nWarriors Three\n and the \nValkyries\n, who had greater durability than low-tier Asgardian warriors, with no permanent damage, and managed to continue fighting afterwards, withstood a repeated tossing to the ground from \nHulk\n during the \nContest of Champions\n with no damage whereas Loki, despite his own extreme resilience, was completely wiped out from such an attack, and he was able to remain conscious upon being overpowered and pummelled by the angered Hulk long enough for him to experience a vision from Odin and turn the tides while sustaining no injury. After getting his full powers, Thor's durability grew much greater, with him thus shrugging off Hela's attacks and continuing to fight her with no deterioration in his performance and even managing to remain conscious after having been badly beaten by \nThanos\n to an even greater degree than Hulk was, which still soundly knocked out the gamma beast, and even survived having his head squeezed by Thanos, whereas Loki was quickly killed by Thanos with less effort, once again proving he is significantly more durable and resilient than Loki, and soon be exposed to the vacuum of space, although all this combined caused him to pass out. Thor was also capable of surviving the full force of a re-ignited \nNidavellir\n star for several minutes, though it left his body severely charred and rendered him unconscious, leaving him to death without the power of Stormbreaker. Thor's physical constitution is so strong he was able to survive exposure to the power of the \nInfinity Stones\n, as evidenced when he was able to quickly recover from being hit by the Reality Stone's powers whenever Malekith blasted it at him. He was also able to remain conscious after repeatedly being pressed by the force of the \nPower Stone\n against his head, albeit at a less degree of the stone's full power, whereas beings less powerful were instantly obliterated by the Stone, although he nevertheless suffered excruciating pain every time Thanos pressed it against him and prolonged exposure would have likely eventually killed him, as Loki quickly submitted to Thanos' demands when he saw Thor being tortured by the Power Stone. Even while hampered by his poor lifestyle and subsequent weight gain, he was still far more durable than most of the other Avengers, as he was able to withstand getting pummeled by the \n2014 Thanos\n' strongest attacks while remaining conscious, as well as enduring Thanos using \nStormbreaker\n to nearly gut open his chest long enough for \nCaptain America\n to save him with only minor bruises and bleeding scars. After returning back to shape, he was capable of withstanding an extended beating from \nGorr the God Butcher\n without visible injuries.\nSuperhuman Speed\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor moving in \nQuicksilver\n's perception\n \n \n Thor can run and move at great superhuman speed. He tackled \nHulk\n through the wall of a \nHelicarrier\n in a split second, visibly appearing as a blur when they were battling in the hangar bay. He also proved capable of overwhelming Hulk in hand-to-hand combat during their second fight, able to easily dodge his feral attacks and land his own blows and get a grip on him. In battle, while holding back, he was easily fast enough to contend with the extremely fast Loki in combat and although his adopted brother was capable of outmaneuvering him when he is holding back, when Thor unleashed his rage, he was able to easily catch Loki off-guard, disarm him of his scepter and then brutally attack him without Loki being able to react in their second duel, implying that his speed exceeds Loki's. Moreover, Thor was so fast that he was still moving in \nQuicksilver\n's accelerated perception, while \nCaptain America\n and \nIron Man\n appeared as frozen in comparison. He could also contend with \nHela\n, who had easily killed several \nEinherjar\n before they could react, and for a time, was able to briefly push her back, land blows and react to her attacks after she recovered before being ultimately outpaced, and after he unlocked his full powers. With full powers, he was able to stay in combat with Hela to an even greater degree, showing no strain in moving fast enough to land glancing blows on her and even to surprise and lift her off the ground. Although he was easily kicked away soon after, Thor was able to surprise and land a hit on Thanos before he could kill Hulk. Even with his fat body diminishing his speed, he was still stupendously fast, as he was able to surprise the Mad Titan twice; first when he had just knocked down Captain America, catching him off-guard enough to disarm him and then in their last altercation when he was in a haste to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet to briefly outmaneuver him enough to land a blow with his hammer and slash off his armor with his axe.\nSuperhuman Agility\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor attacking \nHulk\n while dodging his axe\n \n \n Thor's agility, dexterity, balance and bodily coordination makes him a great warrior for battle. He moves with incredible grace and speed despite his considerable size and body density. He was able to dodge the wing of a jet fighter thrown at him by \nHulk\n, as well as dodging many of Hulk's hammer and battle-axe blows and outmanoeuvring him in their second battle. He could easily keep up with Loki while holding back despite Loki's great agility in both their fights. While his five years of constant drinking and becoming fat did hamper his agility, he was still extremely agile, as he was able to dodge Thanos' \nsword\n when it was thrown at him and seamlessly attack Thanos enough to disarm him and quickly landed hits on Thanos immediately upon landing down to intercept him when he was off-guard in their last altercation.\nSuperhuman Stamina\n: Thor is able to fight prolonged battles and endure the physical stress, allowing him to exercise his maximum capacity for an extremely long period of time without tiring at all. Thor is able to endure the vacuum of space while unconscious. According to a book read by \nJane Foster\n, Thor's hammer granted him great stamina, spirit and health.\nSuperhuman Reflexes\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor dodging \nThanos\n's \nsword\n \n \n Thor can react and dodge objects traveling at high speeds, with him dodging many of \nHulk\n's blows during the \nContest of Champions\n and he was able to blast away swords thrown by \nHela\n as soon as they were sent flying towards him. He was able to dodge intense \nOdinforce\n beams from the \nDestroyer\n and deflect them with Mjlnir. Thor was capable of reacting to energy blasts from Loki's \nScepter\n during their battle on Avengers Tower and from \nChitauri Guns\n, using his hammer to deflect them. Thor even managed to react to \nQuicksilver\n by hurling Mjlnir at him before he could reach him, as well as easily catch the \nThunderbolt\n thrown at him by \nZeus\n.\nRegenerative Healing Factor\n: Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it is still possible to injure Thor. However, due to his Asgardian physiology, Thor is able to heal at a rate significantly faster than a normal human and even much faster than most Asgardians. After seemingly being killed by the \nDestroyer\n and proving himself worthy of Mjlnir once again, Thor regained his full power and immediately healed himself in seconds. Despite receiving mild to severe stab wounds from Asgardian blades on several occasions, after working past the initial pain of the injury, Thor was able to quickly recover and continue fighting. After the brutal beating he suffered from \nKurse\n, upon arriving at Earth several minutes later, he had nearly completely recovered from his bleeding wounds. While fighting \nHela\n, Thor was painfully pierced multiple times by her Necroswords, getting his right eye gouged out in the process, and while Thor was unable to regenerate his eye, he recovered from all of the stabs mere minutes later, despite the \nWarriors Three\n all perishing from a single stab from Hela each. After suffering a beating from \nThanos\n and getting burned by the \nPower Stone\n, Thor managed to recover rapidly afterwards. Later, Thor survived the full force of a re-ignited \nNidavellir\n star, though it left his body charred and near death, Thor was completely healed after receiving \nStormbreaker\n to harness and amplify his supernatural powers.\nLongevity\n: Thor, like all other \nAsgardians\n, is not truly immortal. It is possible to kill an Asgardian and other beings in the \nNine Realms\n. More accurately, Asgardians are extremely long-lived beings, Thor ages at a very slow pace, being able to live for thousands of years. During his conversation with \nRocket\n, Thor claimed to be 1,500 years old.\nFlight\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor flying over the battlefield in \nWakanda\n \n \n One of Thor's new abilities that he discovered after losing Mjlnir was how he is able to hover, glide and fly through the air at great speeds without any outside help. He was able to grab onto Hulk and lift him several feet in the air while they were fighting in the \nContest of Champions\n. He also was able to hover across the \nRainbow Bridge\n multiple times during his final encounter with his sister Hela. He was able to launch himself into the air from the Royal Palace to the middle of the Bifrost within moments. During the \nBattle of Wakanda\n, Thor flew easily while using \nStormbreaker\n to destroy the ships of the \nOutriders\n and later while attacking \nThanos\n.\n\"Hit \nher\n with a lightning blast.\"\n\"I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning!\"\n\nLoki\n and Thor\n[src]\nElectricity Generation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor shooting electricity\n \n \n Thor was born with the ability to generate, control and project electrical energy, with him thus being the God of Thunder. Even while unable to personally harness it and needing \nMjlnir\n to focus his powers over electricity, Thor's electric bolts were already strong enough that it was able to blacken an \nAether\n-enhanced \nMalekith\n, take down two Chitauri \nLeviathans\n and a large amount of the aliens and his electrical powers was already potent enough that Thor could generate incredible enough levels of electricity as to help Iron Man swiftly smite the falling Sokovia City to oblivion. Following \nOdin\n's death and visions from his father's spirit, Thor finally fully unlocked his electrical powers and his powers over lightning were enhanced to the point where he can generate incredible amounts of electrical energy from his own body and summon thunder and lightning from the sky, all without the use of Mjlnir. His new ability allows him to seamlessly integrate lightning into his fighting sequences against \nHulk\n in the \nContest of Champions\n, and then later against \nHela\n along with her undead army. He becomes able to use lightning to mimic telekinesis by wrapping enemies with lightning to pull and hurl them away, release smaller blasts of lightning that can reduce projectiles to pieces, and infuse his weapons with electricity. Thor's generated lightning bolts grew so powerful that he was able to easily send an enraged \nHulk\n flying back and visibly stun him for a time and even temporarily stun and knockdown \nHela\n herself with a single respective blast. Thor was even able to cast a lightning bolt powerful enough to destroy a portion of the \nRainbow Bridge\n that Hela was standing on to ultimately send her crashing down into the water beneath. Wielding \nStormbreaker\n, Thor's powers over electricity grew greatly to the point that he was able to generate a lightning blast powerful enough to knock \nThanos\n back a considerable distance and using all his power, was able to charge the Stormbreaker so powerfully that he was able to throw it with enough power to quickly slice through a beam fired from the completed \nInfinity Gauntlet\n, although Thanos was off-guard and did not use the Infinity Gauntlet to its full power, and grievously injure Thanos in a single strike, with Thanos himself saying that Thor might have been able to kill him had he aimed for the head. By the end of his time as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor's thunder-telekinesis had evolved to be able to stop two moderate-sized machines and their pilots and throw them into the sky without much effort. He also developed the ability to unleash wider streams of lightning upon either his lightning-imbued fist or Stormbreaker hitting a target to simultaneously destroy multiple enemies as well. A lightning blast from Thor using Stormbreaker was also enough to keep Gorr using the Necrosword to block it unable to press forward and eventually push him back.\nStorm Manipulation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor creating storm clouds and thunder\n \n \n Thor was also born with the power to control weather storms, with it being the reason he is known as the God of Thunder. Even before Thor unlocked his powers, he still displayed a level of control over the weather, able to manipulate parts of it, although his focus always seemed to be somewhere else so whenever events of him displaying this power occurred his mind was elsewhere. Among them was when he was able to keep rain from touching Jane Foster as a downpour occurred as well as when he began to generate sparks of lightning from his hands after becoming furious. He began to unlock the full potential of his abilities during his encounter with Hela and is now able to generate rather large storm clouds and create thunder.\n\"Whosoever holds these weapons, and believes in getting home, if they be true of heart is therefore worthy, and shall possess, for limited time only, the power of Thor!\"\nThor\n[src]\nEnchantment\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor giving his powers to the kids of Asgard\n \n \n Thor is able to cast enchantments on any weapon. Thor was able to cast an enchantment in \nMjlnir\n to always protect \nJane Foster\n.\nPower Bestowal\n: After controlling his powers to their full capacity, Thor is able to enchant any weapons or sentient creatures in order to bestow his powers as the God of Thunder to them. Thor gave his powers to the kids of Asgard for a limited amount of time so that they were able to fight off against \nGorr\n's \nShadow Monsters\n.\n\"Every time I threw \nit\n, it would come back to me. With it I could cast lightning, make energy blasts, and when I spun it really fast, it gave me the ability to fly.\"\nThor to \nKorg\n[src]\nMjlnir\n Capabilities\n: Due to the enchantments placed upon the mystical hammer, Thor was granted the ability to focus his innate mystical abilities and harness them. It allowed him to easily harness his dominion over weather elements and that allowed for several other sub-abilities to follow suit. Along with the discovery of his powers originating from himself instead of his weapon, Thor retained the abilities he had with and without Mjlnir once he obtained \nStormbreaker\n, which also amplified them to a degree.\nElectricity Generation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor projecting electricity with \nMjlnir\n \n \n Thor's main weapon while using Mjlnir is the ability to summon a lightning bolt from the surrounding skyline. As well as being able to channel electricity on its own Mjlnir is able to attract the ambient electricity from the surrounding atmosphere and redirect it towards a given target, such as when he summoned electricity from inside of Avengers Tower and used it to bring Vision to life. While on Jotunheim, Thor summoned a huge lightning bolt, strong enough to destroy a large portion of the landscape. During the \nBattle of New York\n, Thor used the spire of the Chrysler building to channel a tremendous lightning bolt, which he directed at the portal of the Chitauri to deter a portion of the enemy reinforcements, managing to bring down two massive \nLeviathan\n and numerous \nChitauri\n aliens with the blast. During the \nBattle of Sokovia\n, Thor was able to generate an incredible amount of lightning, helping Iron Man swiftly smite the hovering Sokovian \ncapital city\n into oblivion, thwarting Ultron's plans in the process. After his visions of Odin and discovering Mjlnir was not the source of his powers, he became capable of summoning thunder and lightning without it and even generating electrical energy from his own body. Thor's power over electrical energy was greatly enhanced by his use of Stormbreaker, which restored and improved upon the abilities he possessed with Mjlnir.\nStorm Manipulation\n: Wielding Mjlnir helped refine Thor's power to give him the ability to control the base elements of a storm. It could control the elements and create giant raging electrical storms complete with thunder, lightning, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, tidal waves, earthquakes and torrential rains all on a moment's notice. With Mjlnir's help, Thor was able to summon an isolated class 5 tornado while battling the \nDestroyer\n as well as a lightning bolt strong enough to destroy a large piece of landscape in Jotunheim. The Norse myths and legends regarded him as the God of Thunder because of the hammer's influence over the weather. After discovering that Mjlnir was only used to focus his power and was never the source of it, Thor was able to summon thunder and lightning from the sky as well as from his own body. With the use of Stormbreaker, the abilities Thor had with his hammer were restored and greater enhanced.\nEnergy Projection\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor blocking \nSurtur\n's fire blasts\n \n \n With Mjlnir, Thor could project blasts, waves and bolts of electrical energy of various sizes and intensities. While the hammer can generate electrical energy, it can channel more energy from the lightning storms it creates to summon its lightning for powerful energy attacks. With Mjlnir, \nOdin\n could project a powerful beam of golden light and use it to take away all of Thor's superhuman powers, destroy what was left of Thor's armor after stripping much of it off of him and ultimately send him flying into the Bifrost. He can also use Mjlnir to swing his hammer around fast and create an area of forcefield-like energy.\nWeight Manipulation\n: Mjlnir's enchantment allows its worthy wielders to swing it nearly effortlessly yet, in reality, it is extremely heavy to an average person. Its ability to manipulate its weight allows Thor to hurl Mjlnir at great speeds or alternatively by holding onto the leather thong and whirling it like a flail, use the hammer as a thrashing vortex. In \nJotunheim\n, he bashed the Frost Giants around him, then threw Mjlnir, making it hit multiple \nFrost Giants\n in its path in moments. \nQuicksilver\n, \nLoki\n and \nHulk\n were pinned down by Mjlnir's immense weight, though also due to them being unworthy to wield it.\nFlight\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor flying away from the \nFire Dragon\n \n \n Thor was capable of spinning Mjlnir with great force, at such high speeds that it seemed like a blur to the naked eye, and by holding onto the leather thong, was capable of flying through the air at immense speeds. How fast exactly was not specified, but he was able to remain aloft in the middle of a Class 5 tornado, and traverse the distance from his father's chambers to \nHiminbjorg\n and back again in seconds. Using Mjlnir, Thor could also move across the New Mexico desert in a matter of seconds. While flying, Thor can use his speed to strike enemies with immense force, such as when he tackled Hulk through a wall, tackled \nMalekith\n in and out of portals and when Thor killed a Frost Beast on Jotunheim by flying through its skull.\nWeapon Calling\n: Mjlnir obeyed Thor's calling as though it was driven by a form of intelligence. Mjlnir went to Thor when it was in a crater miles away, arriving in seconds. It would return to Thor whenever he threw it at an opponent. While battling Hulk in a hanger of the \nHelicarrier\n, Thor summoned Mjlnir from another room and it came crashing through the \nHelicarrier\n to get to him. Thor's newest weapon, \nStormbreaker\n, retains Mjlnir's ability to be summoned and telekinetically controlled by the user.\nArmor Creation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor summoning his armor\n \n \n By summoning lightning from the sky into Mjlnir, Thor's clothes are transformed into his combat armor. The hammer was also able to transform Thor's clothing into those worn by humans, while it could appear as an umbrella. With the use of Stormbreaker, Thor is able to transform his clothing into his combat armor once more.\nSelf-Resurrection\n: Mjlnir possessed the ability to revive people back from death itself and to restore them to optimum health like when it resurrected Thor as he was passing away due to being injured by the \nDestroyer\n while he was mortal. This ability was passed over to Thor's replacement for Mjlnir, \nStormbreaker\n, which allowed him to fully recover from nearly fatal injuries.\n\"Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?\"\n\"The \nThanos\n killing kind.\"\n\nStar-Lord\n and Thor\n[src]\nStormbreaker\n Capabilities\n: After acquiring a new weapon to replace \nMjlnir\n, Thor gained additional powers through its use.\nElectricity Generation\n: When using \nStormbreaker\n, Thor could easily generate electricity which he used many times to strike \nGorr the God Butcher\n to keep his distance. The electricity can strike the enemy from above, or generate around the weapon to create a bigger blow.\nStorm Manipulation\n: Thor could manipulate the weather around him with \nStormbreaker\n. He was able to generate thunder and lightning while calling his weapons before fighting \nThanos\n.\nBifrost Summoning\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor summons the \nBifrost\n via \nStormbreaker\n \n \n After Thor gained his new devastating weapon, \nStormbreaker\n, he was able to teleport at will, due to gaining the ability to manipulate the \nBifrost Bridge\n. As a result, Thor instantly teleported himself, \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n to \nWakanda\n, in order to aid his allies in the battle against \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n. He could also use Stormbreaker to summon a Bifrost Bridge from under him, which he used to travel to the \nShadow Realm\n as well as \nEarth\n.\nWeapon Calling\n: After Thor received his new axe, Stormbreaker, he gained the ability to summon it similar to Mjlnir.\nArmor Creation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor summoning his armor\n \n \n Using \nStormbreaker\n, Thor could summon various armors, including an all-black one, a Viking-like armor, a blue and gold armor, as well as a navy and gold armor.\n\"This is the army right here. It's sleek, it's slender, it's powerful, it's beautiful...\"\nThor to \nValkyrie\n[src]\nThunderbolt\n Capabilities\n: Thor stole the \nThunderbolt\n after he defeated \nZeus\n. Although originally used by Valkyrie, she gifted it to him for his battle with \nGorr the God Butcher\n.\nElectricity Generation\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor projecting electricity at \nGorr\n \n \n The \nThunderbolt\n allowed Thor to generate yellow electricity rather than the usual blue that he generates. He used this to wound \nGorr the God Butcher\n.\nFlight\n: Similar to his previous weapons, \nMjlnir\n and \nStormbreaker\n, Thor could use the \nThunderbolt\n to fly off the ground.\nTeleportation\n: Thor used the \nThunderbolt\n to create a sphere of energy around him. This energy allowed him to travel to \nEternity\n, where \nGorr the God Butcher\n planned to kill all Gods.\nWeapon Calling\n: Thor could throw the \nThunderbolt\n and call it back to his hand whenever he would want, similar to \nMjlnir\n or \nStormbreaker\n.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"You made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops. That's hurtful. In my experience it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them.\"\n\nPhil Coulson\n to Thor\n[src]\nMaster Combatant\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting against \nHela\n \n \n Thor is the greatest and most powerful warrior in Asgard since \nOdin\n and \nHela\n have currently been deceased. He is an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having trained extensively in the arts of war and various Asgardian fighting techniques from a young age in Asgard, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters in the Nine Realms. He is therefore extremely masterful in many areas of combat and with more than a millennium of training and combat experience, including hand-to-hand combat and various forms of weaponry available in \nAsgard\n, primarily swords and spears, though he usually prefers to wield his hammer \nMjlnir\n. Thor is known to be very cunning and intuitive in battles and in warfare, having fought and defeated many enemies throughout his life. Even when rendered mortal and stripped of his strength and powers, Thor utilized his sheer vast fighting skills to overpower nearly a dozen highly skilled \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n operatives in hand-to-hand combat, as the very impressed \nPhil Coulson\n stated that Thor made some of the most highly trained professionals in the world \"look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops.\" At full power, Thor has fought and defeated over a hundred \nMarauder\n warriors in \nVanaheim\n, beaten several armed Asgardian soldiers without needing to use his hammer with ease, battled hordes of \nFrost Giants\n with great ease in \nJotunheim\n and also numerous hordes of \nChitauri\n aliens in the \nBattle of New York\n. During the \nBattle of Sokovia\n, Thor fought and destroyed many \nUltron Sentries\n effortlessly, prompting an irritated \nUltron\n to tackle him away and deal with Thor personally. Thor was also able to overpower the extremely formidable \nDestroyer\n, which even the combined might of \nLady Sif\n and the \nWarriors Three\n failed to do. In his first fight with the larger \nHulk\n, Thor was able to skillfully maneuver through his wild attacks and successfully strike the latter with ease. During both his fights with Loki, even despite holding back not to kill him, Thor was still more than a match for his brother, also an exceptional fighter in his own right, easily matching him blow-to-blow while steadily gaining the upper hand over his brother before finally decisively beating him, even casually overtaking Loki unarmed in their second fight when he had the \nScepter\n. Thor even went toe-to-toe with the extremely skilled and experienced Aether-enhanced \nMalekith\n, and ultimately defeated the latter after a prolonged battle. When infiltrating \nMuspelheim\n, Thor effortlessly defeated hordes of Surtur's \nMuspelheim\n warriors and even managed to take down a weakened version of \nSurtur\n himself rather easily before escaping unharmed. During the \nContest of Champions\n, pitted against the Hulk, despite Hulk having acquired years of training and experience from his time there, Thor still displayed a substantially superior fighting level, easily able to counter most of Hulk's blows both in armed and hand-to-hand combat and outfight and land several blows, with Hulk only able to hit him at all when he was surprised, and with his full powers, he swiftly outmatched Hulk, with only Grandmaster's interference keeping Thor from winning. Thor was even capable of standing up the far more powerful and experienced \nHela\n in their second fight, who had single-handedly massacred the top-elite Asgardian warrior \nValkyries\n and all the \nEinherjar\n, able to briefly outmaneuver her even unarmed while she had her Necrosword before ultimately being overpowered and having his right eye gouged out. Upon gaining his full powers, Thor was able to effortlessly defeat all of Hela's undead troops with his bare hands and with aid from \nValkyrie\n was able to fight Hela to a prolonged standstill. Thor also survived his first battle with \nThanos\n and despite having been easily defeated and badly pummeled, managed to surprise and land a hit on him before getting easily kicked away. After acquiring \nStormbreaker\n and regaining his armor, Thor effortlessly killed many Outriders and destroyed their ships and, by focusing all of his power into a single blow, was the only hero able to surprise and severely injure Thanos. When battling the \n2014 Thanos\n, Thor, despite having not fought for 5 years and gotten out of shape, proved to remain an extremely formidable fighter, as not only could he easily take down multiple Outriders, but he even fought the hardest against the Mad Titan out of himself, Captain America and Iron Man, managing to disarm Thanos of his \nsword\n and come considerably close to killing him with some aid from Rogers. Upon returning to shape, Thor was able to single-handedly defeat the entire army of Booskans who had been pressuring the Guardians and the Indigarrians within a matter of a minute. During his battles with Gorr the God Butcher, Thor proved capable of single-handedly handling the fearsome wielder of the Necrosword, who could fight Mighty Thor and Valkyrie off together and easily defeated Sif and many other gods in the universe, managing to push him back in their first and second engagements, and even with the \nThunderbolt\n he had never wielded before, Thor was still able to repeatedly overtake the God Butcher, delivering multiple vicious blows even unarmed in their first and second rounds before being knocked down in the former and ultimately holding him at a standstill for Jane to destroy the sword at their final scuffle.\n\"You've got a mean swing.\"\n\nTony Stark\n to Thor\n[src]\nHammer Mastery\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor hitting \nMalekith\n with \nMjlnir\n \n \n Thor is extremely skilled at using his war hammer \nMjlnir\n in combat, having centuries of practice wielding it, as well as extremely proficient at hammer throwing. He even had been able to use Mjlnir as a powerful defense tool, blocking energy shots from the \nDestroyer\n, \nLoki's Scepter\n, \nChitauri\n weaponry, \nMalekith\n's \nAether\n and even \nSurtur\n's \nTwilight Sword\n (though Surtur was notably not at full power then). His overall skill in using Mjlnir in combat had allowed him to best Loki twice using the equally powerful \nScepter\n and \nGungnir\n despite later admitting he was holding back, stalemate the Aether-enhanced \nMalekith\n, kill \nSurtur\n and effortlessly defeat multiple enemies be it Frost Giants, Ultron's sentries or Surtur's warriors. Thor's hammer fighting skills are also highly adaptable, as displayed when he used a \nfar bulkier Sakaaran hammer\n to battle \nHulk\n in the \nContest of Champions\n due to his hammer having been destroyed and was able to dominate Hulk and break his axe, although Hulk managed to use his growing rage to catch a blow from Thor using said hammer and then surprise and disarm him. Not using his hammer for several years did little to hamper Thor's skill in hammer combat, as he was quickly able to dual-wield Mjlnir along with Stormbreaker effectively against \nThanos\n and Outriders, with Thanos being forced to use Iron Man to shield himself when Thor threw the hammer at him and easily killing many Outriders when he switched weapons. He was also readily able to use \nDoug\n's \nmace\n in conjunction with a \nshield\n in his duel against Hulk, but did not get a proper chance to use them and instead had to resort to using a knife and \nswords\n. His proficiency with blunt weapons extended to borrowing \nKorg\n's \nlaser rifle\n during the \nEscape from Omnipotence City\n.\n\"Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody who chopped \nThanos\n' big head off?\"\nThor to \nKorg\n[src]\nAxe Mastery\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting \nThanos\n with \nStormbreaker\n \n \n Thor is extremely skilled at using an axe in combat. He was able to wield his newly forged \nStormbreaker\n with ease against numerous \nOutriders\n, single-handedly taking down an entire ship of Outriders and even able to severely injure \nThanos\n with a single throw. Even while out of shape, Thor was able to stand his ground against the \n2014 Thanos\n using his sword, even able to disarm him and slice him when he was unarmed, along with later on cutting his armor when he was off-guard. While using Stormbreaker, Thor expertly transitions between using the hammer section and the axe portion in battle, using the former to land vicious blows channeled by his own electricity to target multiple Outriders and using the edges of the axe to mortally wound and later decapitate the Mad Titan himself.\nSpear Mastery\n: Thor is highly skilled at using a spear in combat. He was able to wield \nGungnir\n in his second battle against \nHela\n, and was briefly able to push her back, disarming her of her \nNecrosword\n and scoring several hits and countering some of her attacks, before ultimately getting disarmed.\nSword Mastery\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor fighting \nGorr\n with \nThunderbolt\n \n \n Thor is highly skilled at using swords in combat, with him choosing a \npair of blades\n out of all available weapons for the \nContest of Champions\n, and managing to block several strikes from \nHulk\n with them, though the swords broke in the process. Thor later used another pair of blades against \nHela\n in their second battle and was able to momentarily hold his own against her, though Thor was quickly disarmed. Thor would later duel much better against Hela using two blades in their final fight when he had unlocked his full powers, managing to land glancing hits on the Goddess of Death and easily destroy her Necroswords. While using the \nThunderbolt\n, Thor used his swordsmanship with the blade-like structure of the divine weapon to contend with Gorr's usage of the Necrosword.\nChain Mastery\n: \nZeus\n bounded Thor in chains while he talked to him in front of many gods. Thor then broke out and used the chains to fight the guards.\nExpert Marksman\n: Thor is a highly skilled marksman, being able to gun down several \nSakaaran Guards\n with a \nSakaaran Laser Rifle\n with little effort during the \nEscape from Sakaar\n. However, his marksmanship is best demonstrated in throwing his hammer or axe, being able to throw them with extreme accuracy, hitting his target every time.\nExpert Acrobat\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor stopping two vehicles with split\n \n \n During a battle with the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n against a group of rebels, Thor stopped two approaching vehicles using only his legs. He did this by going into a split position where he stopped each with one leg. He could also do various flips while fighting \nGorr the God Butcher\n and his \nShadow Monsters\n.\n\"Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan.\"\nThor\n[src]\nMaster Tactician\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor planning \nJane Foster\n's escape\n \n \n Thor is an excellent strategist due to centuries of combat training and experience. He has lead his allies into many battles for centuries, including Sif and the Warriors Three, with great leadership and the employment of strategies and tactics adapted from various civilizations across the Nine Realms. In order to save \nJotunheim\n, Thor realized he had to destroy the Rainbow Bridge even though it meant he might never see Jane Foster again. During the \nBattle of Vanaheim\n, Thor ended the battle early just moments after arriving by defeating the biggest Marauder. During the \nSecond Dark Elf Conflict\n, Thor successfully orchestrated Jane Foster's escape from Asgard, a feat which impressed Loki, and nearly succeeded in destroying the Aether had it not been for its indestructibility. After he received a vision by \nWanda Maximoff\n during the \nBattle at the Salvage Yard\n, Thor went to the Water of Sight to unlock the secrets of the hallucinations created by Maximoff during the battle. This decision led to Thor helping create Vision which in turn helped stop the threat of Ultron. Thor realized Loki had replaced Odin and was masquerading as him something other Asgardians had failed to notice. After being trapped on Sakaar, Thor managed to orchestrate an escape from the planet and freed several prisoners at the same time. After realizing he couldn't defeat Hela himself, Thor had Loki resurrect Surtur in order to destroy her. This plan worked and all Asgardians were evacuated before Asgard's destruction. After being defeated by Thanos, Thor realized he needed a new weapon to fight him and went to Nidavellir to make a weapon capable of killing Thanos. This decision proved fruitful as it led to the creation of Stormbreaker. Thor used Stormbreaker to turn the tide during the \nBattle of Wakanda\n and eventually killed Thanos with it. During the \nTheft of the Reality Stone\n, Thor decided to take the past version of \nMjlnir\n to the future with him for use in future battles. This decision proved fruitful as Captain America proved worthy of wielding it and used it to save Thor from being killed by the past version of Thanos. Thor is also a brilliant combat strategist as he has used Mjlnir's worthiness enchantment to immobilize enemies such as \nLoki\n and the \nFire Dragon\n.\nPilot\n: Thor has demonstrated a level of proficiency and knowledge in piloting various types of alien spacecrafts, able to effectively pilot a \nDark Elf Harrow\n and \nGrandmaster\n's ship, the \nCommodore\n, while also displaying some understanding of \nStar-Lord\n's ship, the \nBenatar\n.\n\"You speak \nGroot\n?\"\n\"Yes, they taught it on \nAsgard\n. It was an elective.\"\n\nRocket\n and Thor\n[src]\nMultilingualism\n: Thor is fluent in many alien languages but most in his native Asgardian, as well as English, and he can also understand \nGroot\n.\nEquipment\n[\n]\nAsgardian Armor\n[\n]\n\"So is this how you normally look?\"\n\"More or less.\"\n\"It's a good look!\"\n\nJane Foster\n and Thor\n[src]\nFirst Set\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor wears armor into battle against \nLaufey\n \n \n His first set of armor had a collared blue tunic with red piping and black pants. Over the blue shirt, he wore a black vest emblazoned with silver overlay. He wore a bright red cape that connected at the shoulders of his vest. His arms were covered in a form of chain-mail and he wore detailed, black, knee-high boots.\nSecond Set\n: Thor's second set of armor worn while fighting in the forest with \nCaptain America\n and \nIron Man\n. It was sleeveless with a black top covered in silver plates. It has blue pants and black boots. It had red wristbands covered with silver arm bracers. It also had a bright red cape. During Thor's stay on the \nHelicarrier\n he removed portions of his armor such as his cape, larger arm bracers and part of his chest plate, while in the more relaxed setting. While heading into the \nBattle of New York\n he re-donned his cape and heavier portions of his armor, adding to it a set of chain-mail sleeves as seen in the first set.\nThird Set\n: The third set was a layered, collared, black vest with gold plates and blue accents worn over a chain-mail shirt. The vest continued into a loincloth which hung over chain-mail and leather pants. The sleeves ended at arm-bracers similar-looking to the vest with a red underside. He wore knee-high brown boots with gold piping. The third set also featured a bright red cape that was attached to the vest by two gold disks. During his time on \nSakaar\n, Thor supplemented the then-damaged Third set with pieces of armor salvaged from the Sakaaran Armory, most prominently a teal pauldron on his left shoulder and a similarly colored bracer on his right shin.\nFourth Set\n: Thor's fourth set of armor, donned following the escape of \nAsgard\n's destruction but before \nThanos\n' attack, was comprised of a layered, collared black vest containing his recurring silver plates, navy blue pants, and short strapped leather gloves. After attaining \nStormbreaker\n, Thor added his signature red cape and chain-mail sleeves in preparation to the Fourth Set for his rematch with Thanos.\nFifth Set\n: Thor donned his fifth set of armor after leaving the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n to answer \nSif\n's call for help in her battle against \nGorr the God Butcher\n. The armor was comprised of a layered black vest, black pants and a fur lined cape.\nSixth Set\n: Thor's sixth set of armor, donned during the \nAttack on New Asgard\n, was comprised of a gold and blue chestplate and pants, with a red cape. The armor also had a golden feathered helmet and chain-mail sleeves, which Thor only wore during the first battle. He wore this armor throughout his \nconflict\n with \nGorr the God Butcher\n.\nSeventh Set\n: Thor's seventh set of armor was identical to the sixth, though the blue on the armor was replaced by black. Thor wore this armor during his adventures with \nLove\n throughout the galaxy.\nWeapons\n[\n]\n\"I really wish I had my \nhammer\n. It was quite unique. It was made of a \nspecial metal\n and forged in the heart of a \ndying star\n.\"\nThor to \nKorg\n[src]\nMjlnir\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor unleashes the full power of \nMjlnir\n \n \n Thor was entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjlnir, that was forged from the heart of a dying star. Thor's mystical hammer Mjlnir, which resembles a mallet rather than a traditional war hammer, has a number of elemental based powers. It has been stated by \nOdin\n himself that Mjlnir's power has no equal. Mjlnir itself is extremely durable and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, it is, for all intents and purposes, indestructible. It has deflected three blasts from the \nDestroyer\n, which was able to disintegrate anything that it hit and return the blast back into the Destroyer. Thor often uses the hammer as a physical weapon, with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer blow or throw, with the exception of \nCaptain America's Shield\n.\nWorthiness Enchantment\n: After Thor disobeyed Odin and nearly caused a war between \nAsgard\n and \nJotunheim\n, Odin banished Thor to \nEarth\n without his powers and placed an enchantment on the hammer Mjlnir. \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\" This enchantment surrounding Mjlnir prevents it from being wielded by anyone save those who have been found worthy. When Thor sacrificed himself to protect the Earth from the Destroyer he proved himself worthy to wield Mjlnir once again and gained full use of his powers. Only Thor, \nOdin\n, \nVision\n, \nHela\n, \nCaptain America\n and \nMighty Thor\n are known to be able to wield Mjlnir. Indeed, not even \nHulk\n's incredible strength could lift Mjlnir, as the hammer did not deem him worthy.\n\"A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in \nAsgard\n. In theory, it could even summon the \nBifrost\n.\"\n\"Does it have a name?\"\n\"Stormbreaker.\"\n\nEitri\n and Thor\n[src]\nStormbreaker\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor fights the \nOutriders\n with \nStormbreaker\n \n \n Thor's newly forged maul \nStormbreaker\n was able to focus and hone Thor's powers, acting as a conduit, and is the strongest weapon in Asgard's history. The weapon, due to being made out of \nUru\n, is nigh-indestructible and created to combat the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n and kill \nThanos\n, it was able to withstand and overpower an energy blast powered by all six \nInfinity Stones\n and even grievously injure Thanos. The only reason it failed to kill him was that Thor intentionally delayed the killing blow, a catastrophic mistake unrelated to the weapon's abilities. Stormbreaker is able to summon the \nBifrost Bridge\n, even after the bridge's apparent destruction, shown when Thor teleported himself, \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n to \nWakanda\n instantly. The weapon, like \nMjlnir\n before it, will return to Thor's hand when he opens it and strikes his opponents with massive force. However, upon witnessing the powers of his adopted daughter Love, Thor shared Stormbreaker with her as they set off on adventures to help others across the universe.\nOther Equipment\n[\n]\nCybernetic Eye\n: On their way to \nNidavellir\n, Rocket handed to Thor a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost during his battle with Hela, restoring his lost range of sight and depth perception.\nFormer Equipment\n[\n]\nAsgardian Collar\n: After the \nBattle of New York\n, Thor placed an Asgardian collar on Loki in order to silence him.\nGravimetric Spikes\n: During the \nBattle of Greenwich\n, Thor utilized Erik Selvig's devices. He used two of them to sever both of Malekith's arms. Thor then used Mjlnir to smash the last device into Malekith's chest, allowing Jane Foster to transport him back to \nSvartalfheim\n, halting his attack.\nMegingjr\n: Thor's magical belt. He left it on \nEarth\n, in \nIron Man\n's possession, before departing to learn more about the \nInfinity Stones\n.\nWinged Helmet\n: Prior to his banishment, Thor possessed a silver Asgardian war helm adorned with wings on its sides. He wore it along with his armor during his coronation as king, but the sudden appearance of \nFrost Giants\n led him to abandon it while he and \nOdin\n went to investigate the \nVault\n.\nCrown of Black Fire\n: Following the defeat of \nSurtur\n in \nMuspelheim\n, Thor took the Crown of Black Fire and brought it back to \nAsgard\n, where he intended to lock it inside \nOdin's Vault\n; however, upon arriving, Thor noticed that \nOdin\n mistakenly referred to the Crown of the Skull of Surtur, adding to his belief that Odin was really \nLoki\n in disguise. During the battle against \nHela\n, Thor knew that Surtur would be the only one who could defeat Hela, so tasked Loki with combining the Crown with the \nEternal Flame\n in order to allow Surtur to be reborn and finally destroy Hela once and for all.\nThor's Arena Helmet\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor with his new helmet, mace, and shield\n \n \n Acquired during the \nContest of Champions\n, Thor donned the helmet for his fight against \nGrandmaster\n's \nchampion\n to earn his freedom, but lost it during the fight.\nDoug's Mace and Shield\n: During the \nContest of Champions\n, Thor utilized the mace and shield that belonged to \nDoug\n his battle. During his fight with \nGrandmaster\n's champion, later revealed to be \nHulk\n, Thor lost his weapons in their brawl, and used two retractable swords instead.\nThor's Arena Swords\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nThor with his retractable swords\n \n \n Having lost both his mace and shield in his fight against \nHulk\n, Thor used two retractable swords, although they were soon destroyed by Hulk's \nSakaaran War Hammer\n during the duel.\nThunderbolt\n: Thor used Zeus' Thunderbolt during his battle with \nGorr the God Butcher\n.\nSakaaran War Hammer\n: Thor managed to arm himself with Hulk's War Hammer during their duel on \nSakaar\n, using it to beat down Hulk and destroy his \nSakaaran Battle Axe\n until Hulk caught the Hammer mid-swing and disarmed Thor.\nSakaaran Laser Rifle\n: Thor and Loki used these rifles to fight Grandmaster's guards during their escape plot.\nGungnir\n: Gungnir was a powerful spear used by the rulers of \nAsgard\n and serves as a symbol of Asgardian power, prominently used by \nAsgardian Royal Family\n. When Hela came to take the throne of Asgard, Thor had taken the spear in the \nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n, and briefly used it in a duel before dropping it when Hela had managed to overpower him during their duel.\nTime Suit\n: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the \nQuantum Realm\n safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materializes around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.\nVehicles\n[\n]\n\"I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\"\n\"No, I said 'how hard can it be'.\"\n\nLoki\n and Thor\n[src]\nDark Elf Harrow\n: Following \nMalekith\n's \nattack\n on \nAsgard\n and the death of his \nmother\n, Thor, along with Loki and \nJane Foster\n, commandeered an abandoned Harrow left by the \nDark Elves\n. With Asgard on lockdown by order of Odin, the group used the ship to reach the city's outer limits before switching to an \nAsgardian Skiff\n.\nAsgardian Skiff\n: Thor used an Asgardian Skiff with \nLoki\n and \nFandral\n in order to take \nJane Foster\n away from \nAsgard\n and find a secret passageway to \nSvartalfheim\n.\nQuinjet\n: Thor has used the Quinjet for transportation to travel around the world and take out threats during active missions as a member of the \nAvengers\n.\nCommodore\n: In an attempt to \nescape\n from \nSakaar\n, Thor commandeered \nGrandmaster\n's favored spaceship. As they were being chased by \nSakaaran Guards\n, Thor let \nBruce Banner\n control the spaceship. He then returned and used the spacecraft to cross the \nDevil's Anus\n, which led him back to \nAsgard\n.\nStatesman\n: Thor led the remnants of \nAsgard\n's population in the massive \nStatesman\n, hoping to bring them to \nEarth\n to establish a new Asgardian settlement. However, the ship was \nattacked\n by \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n, and Thor was powerless to prevent the massacre of half its passengers and the subsequent destruction of the ship with the \nPower Stone\n. Thor, however, survived the collapse of the spaceship.\n\"Why don't you take this \nship\n as a parting farewell gift?\"\n\"You're giving me my ship?\"\n\"Yes, she's yours.\"\nThor and \nStar-Lord\n[src]\n \n \n \n \n \nThor aboard the \nBenatar\n \n \nBenatar\n: Rescued by the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, Thor was brought aboard their own spaceship, although he quickly left to head for \nNidavellir\n. Thor and the Avengers later used this ship to travel to \nGarden\n to undo the \nSnap\n and kill Thanos.\nBenatar'\ns Space Pod\n: Thor, along with \nRocket\n and \nGroot\n, used this space capsule to go to \nNidavellir\n in order to have a new \nweapon\n crafted by \nEitri\n. He also used the space pod to reactivate the extinguished forges of Nidavellir.\nAegir\n: Thor along with \nValkyrie\n and \nJane\n rode on Aegir, the flying stiff, which was pulled by his two goats: \nToothgrinder\n and \nToothgnasher\n.\nFacilities\n[\n]\nRoyal Palace of Valaskjalf\n: As his home of \nAsgard\n, Thor resided in the Royal Palace, having a coronation on becoming King, protecting the palace from the \nDark Elves\n, seize the throne from \nHela\n. As the \nRagnark\n occurred, Thor decides to let the prophecy end, leading the palace to be destroyed.\nSmith Motors\n: Thor lost his powers and his weapon after defying against Odin who banishes him to Earth where he was hit by \nJane Foster\n and after he was released from the hospital, he takes up residence in the lab for some time during his recovery.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site\n: When Thor and \nJane Foster\n arrived at the site were \nMjlnir\n landed on \nEarth\n, as it was heavily guarded by S.H.I.E.L.D., he entered the Crater Investigation Site without any thought. Knocking out two agents sent to check in, Thor found finally pick his hammer, only to find himself to be unworthy and was captured by other agents. When \nLoki\n visited Thor in the Crater Investigation Site, he was loss for words when he was told that \nOdin\n was dead, unbeknownst of Loki's manipulation. Thor would later leave the premise under the condition of him being monitored after he was out.\nAvengers Tower\n: As Thor can travel to Earth via \nBifrost Bridge\n, he uses the Avengers Tower as his personal residence during his time on Earth and as an Avenger while fighting against \nHYDRA\n and \nUltron\n.\nJane Foster's Apartment\n: In \n2013\n, Thor and \nJane Foster\n officially started a relationship, and they lived together in Foster's apartment, until the pair broke up in \n2017\nAvengers Compound\n: After Tony sold the Avengers Tower, he moves the Avenger's headquarters to Upstate New York, where he has refurbish one of his company's old warehouse facilities into the new headquarters for the Avengers where Thor spends his time on Earth. Thor returned to the Avengers Compound sometime in \n2018\n after the \nBattle of Wakanda\n where he meets newest Avenger, \nCaptain Marvel\n. Thor left the facility and reside in \nTnsberg\n before being called back to the facility where he helped the Avengers resurrect the victims of the \nSnap\n to commence the \nTime Heist\n and fought against \nThanos\n after he destroyed the facility.\n\"Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way. The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.\"\nThor to \nHulk\n[src]\nGrandmaster Palace\n: When Thor encountered his eldest sister, \nHela\n, she stranded him and Loki to the planet \nSakaar\n where \nValkyrie\n captured Thor and took him to the home of the \nGrandmaster\n.\nThor's Hut\n: Following the \nAsgardians\n immigration to \nNew Asgard\n and the \nSnap\n, Thor lived in a house, where he spent several years wasting away, overeating, and playing video games.\nNew Asgard Town Hall\n: As the king, and later close ally of King \nValkyrie\n, Thor governed New Asgard via its Town Hall.\nRelationships\n[\n]\nFamily\n[\n]\nAsgardian Royal Family\nBuri\n  -

Always.\n \n(voice)\n \nDeadpool & Wolverine\n \n(footage)\nTrivia\n[\n]\nIn the comics, Thor is the son of \nOdin\n and the primeval Earth goddess \nGaea\n, rather than \nFrigga\n.\nThursday originates from Thor's Day, a day of the week named after Thor.\nAlthough Thor is briefly seen wearing his \niconic winged silver helmet\n in the beginning of \nThor\n, he quickly discards it. \nChris Hemsworth\n admitted that the helmet was incredibly uncomfortable and was removed from the costume.\nIn \nThor: Ragnarok\n, Thor briefly wears a \ncollapsable helmet\n visually similar to his iconic winged helmet during his \nbattle\n with \nHulk\n in the \nGrandmaster\n's \narena\n.\nIn the comics, Thor lost his left eye twice, both in futures as the King of Asgard; while in the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n, he has lost his right eye while fighting \nHela\n, only to have it replaced with a \nprosthesis\n.\nThor is the third character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe shown to understand \nGroot\n, the first being \nRocket\n and the second being \nStar-Lord\n.\nThe red war paint adorning Thor's Sakaaran armor translates to \"Lord of Thunder.\"\n[\n42\n]\nBehind the Scenes\n[\n]\nChris Hemsworth\n's brother, \nLiam Hemsworth\n, was originally on the shortlist to play Thor. After \nKenneth Branagh\n decided to change the shortlist, he decided to consider only Chris. Liam gave Chris tips on how to get the role.\nChanning Tatum\n, \nPaul Levesque\n, \nDaniel Craig\n, \nCharlie Hunnam\n, \nTom Hiddleston\n, \nAlexander Skarsgrd\n and \nJoel Kinnaman\n were considered for the role of Thor, before Chris Hemsworth was cast.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nCody Deal\n auditioned for the role of Thor, but didn't get the part.
