These artifacts blessed him with immortality and unmatched power, allowing him to become a dominating conqueror. Founding the \nTen Rings\n organization, the terrorist syndicate would spread to nearly every corner of the world over the millennia. Still, Wenwu was not satisfied  having heard of the ancient village of \nTa Lo\n, he sought to enter the realm for its mythical creatures. In \n1996\n, he ventures into a bamboo maze and comes across \nYing Li\n, a woman guarding the entrance to Ta Lo, who decrees that he is unwelcome in their village. Wenwu refuses to back down, leading them to fight. The two lock eyes on multiple instances, and while Li manages to defeat him, they quickly fell for each other, leading Xu to settle down and grow old with her. The pair had two children, \nShang-Chi\n and \nXialing\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \n2007\n, Li retells this story to her young son Shang-Chi, while also giving him a \ngreen pendant\n to find his way back home. The family's peaceful life was interrupted when one of Wenwu's old rivals, the \nIron Gang\n killed Li, causing him to return to leading the Ten Rings, as well as raising Shang-Chi to be a formidable martial artist for \nthe next seven years\n. Once his training was finished, Shang-Chi moved to the \nUnited States\n to escape his father and live a normal life.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn \nthe present day\n, Shang-Chi (now going by \"Shaun\") and his best friend \nKaty Chen\n work as hotel valets in \nSan Francisco\n. This comes as a minor annoyance to their friends \nSoo\n and \nJohn\n, along with Chen's parents, as Chen and Shaun are overqualified for their job. One morning, while they ride the bus to work, Shaun is suddenly attacked by men seeking his pendant. As he manages to hold his own against them, Chen is forced to take over the wheel after the bus driver is knocked unconscious. After Shaun throws his attackers off the bus, \nRazor Fist\n emerges and attempts to kill him with his machete limb. While Shaun escapes unharmed, the assassin, working for the Ten Rings, has seized his pendant. Recalling a postcard supposedly sent by his sister \nXu Xialing\n, Shaun prepares to depart for \nMacau\n. Chen insists on tagging along with him, determined to learn who Shaun truly is.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the flight, Shaun reveals his true name to Chen and his life before meeting her, his training under the cold supervision of his mentor, the \nDeath Dealer\n, and when he was sent on a hit, but he fled to San Francisco instead. After landing in Macau, Shang-Chi and Chen locate the address of the postcard, finding the \nGolden Daggers Club\n. However, as Shang-Chi had signed a form when he first entered the building, he unknowingly had placed his name in for a fight on the grand stage.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs Chen spectates, Shang-Chi faces a new opponent  a woman whom he immediately recognizes as Xialing. Shang-Chi refuses to fight and attempts to inform her about their father's impending arrival, but he is knocked out. Xialing, embittered at her brother for abandoning her when he fled for San Francisco, reveals that she was not the one who sent the postcard. The Ten Rings infiltrate the Club searching for Xialing's pendant; Shang-Chi and Chen are left by themselves when Xialing deserts them for the elevator. They attempt to scale the scaffolding outside to reach another elevator, but the terrorists attack them there. Shang-Chi fails to catch Chen when she begins to fall, but Xialing saves her.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDeath Dealer appears to snatch Xialing's pendant, prompting Shang-Chi to give chase and fight him. Shang-Chi prepares to kill his mentor, recalling his harsh treatment during his childhood training. However, Shang-Chi is stopped by Wenwu, who has already captured Xialing and Chen. They are taken back to the \nTen Rings Headquarters\n, where Wenwu reveals that his late wife has been calling out for him to come and save her. Recounting that she had left her village to be with him, he believes that the people of Ta Lo have imprisoned her for that decision. Then, using the pendants from both his children, he generates a magical map made of water. The map illustrates a clear path through the bamboo forest to Ta Lo, which only opens before the Qingming Festival. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWenwu reveals his intention to burn the village of Ta Lo down after rescuing his wife, a plan which alienates his children and Chen into raising their objections. For this, they are thrown into a cell. They eventually meet an imprisoned \nTrevor Slattery\n and his \nDijiang\n pet \nMorris\n, who reveals there's a way to pass through Ta Lo's forest maze without waiting for the clear path to be revealed. Using an escape route discovered by Xialing, the party infiltrates the garage. After hijacking Razor Fist's car, they fight off the Ten Rings and flee from the compound. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApproaching the forest maze, Chen is guided by Morris and Slattery as she maneuvers through the shifting bamboo to reach Ta Lo. They manage to make it through unscathed. As they drive into Ta Lo's village, they are confronted by the locals, who urge them to turn back. However, Li's sister \nYing Nan\n intervenes, finally meeting her niece and nephew. Nan takes them through the history of the realm: Once a prospering civilization, the emergence of the \nDweller-in-Darkness\n and its army of \nSoul Eaters\n devastated Ta Lo to near-destruction. Fortunately, the \nGreat Protector\n intervened, and the Dweller was sealed off in a cavern, where it would begin to lure people to it by imitating the voices of their loved ones.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNan suspects that Wenwu had fallen victim to the Dweller's influence. As she trains Shang-Chi in aerokinetic martial arts, Xialing practices with a new rope dart, while Chen learns archery, all in preparation for Wenwu's arrival. One night, Shang-Chi sits alone at the lake and remembers the night of his mother's death: at the hands of his father's rivals, the \nIron Gang\n. He reveals to Chen that he lied about not carrying out the hit against the gang's leader on his first mission. He declares his intention to kill his father for his involvement. The following day, Wenwu and the Ten Rings begin their invasion. Shang-Chi confronts his father, but Wenwu overpowers him and casts Shang-Chi into the lake. Wenwu approaches the barrier and begins to attack it, which releases the Soul Eaters.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDeath Dealer is immediately killed when his soul is taken, prompting Razor Fist to ally the Ten Rings with Ta Lo's guardians to confront the new threat. In the lake, the Great Protector saves Shang-Chi, who arrives at the barrier to confront his father once more. Wenwu loses control of his rings to Shang-Chi during the fight but is spared; Shang-Chi declares that his family needs him. Soon after, the Dweller-in-Darkness emerges from the weakened barrier. Realizing that his sister-in-law was telling the truth, Wenwu saves his son and passes his rings unto him before the Dweller fully steals his soul. The Great Protector is nearly killed by Soul Eaters and the Dweller, but is fortunately saved by Xialing and Chen. With the help of his sister and the Great Protector, Shang-Chi uses the rings to tear the Dweller into pieces, ending the battle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough victorious, both the people of Ta Lo and the Ten Rings suffered heavy losses. The surviving combatants, including Nan, the Ten Rings, and Slattery, hold a vigil to honor the dead. Shang-Chi bids goodbye to his father. He and Chen return to San Francisco and tell the story of their adventure to Soo and John, who do not believe them. \nWong\n emerges from a portal and brings Shang-Chi and Chen to \nKamar-Taj\n to discuss the origin of his father's rings making Soo and John realize that they were telling the truth. \nCarol Danvers\n and \nBruce Banner\n are contacted for help, but they turn out to be clueless. Upon further examination, the mystical relics are shown to have a beacon transmitting a mysterious message. Meanwhile, Xialing returns to the Ten Rings Headquarters and becomes the new leader of the organization.\nCast\n[\n]\nSimu Liu\n as \nShang-Chi\nArnold Sun\n as Teenage \nShang-Chi\nJayden Tianyi Zhang\n as Young \nShang-Chi\nTony Leung\n as \nXu Wenwu\nAwkwafina\n as \nKaty Chen\nBen Kingsley\n as \nTrevor Slattery\nMeng'er Zhang\n as \nXu Xialing\nHarmonie He\n as Teenage \nXu Xialing\nElodie Fong\n as Young \nXu Xialing\nFala Chen\n as \nYing Li\n / \nDweller-in-Darkness\n \n(voice, impersonation)\nMichelle Yeoh\n as \nYing Nan\nYuen Wah\n as Master \nGuang Bo\nFlorian Munteanu\n as \nMattias/Razor Fist\nAndy Le\n as \nLi Ching-Lin/Death Dealer\nPaul He\n as Chancellor \nHui\nStephanie Hsu\n as \nSoo\nKunal Dudheker\n as \nJohn\nTsai Chin\n as \nWaipo Chen\nJodi Long\n as \nMrs. Chen\nDallas Liu\n as \nRuihua Chen\nRonny Chieng\n as \nJon Jon\nStella Ye\n as \nYuchen\nFernando Chien\n as \nGao Lei\nZach Cherry\n as \nKlev\nRaymond Ma\n as \nIron Gang Leader\nBenedict Wong\n as Master \nWong\nJade Xu\n as \nHelen\nShelley Xu\n as \nJie\nDee Bradley Baker\n as \nMorris\n \n(voice)\nTim Roth\n as \nEmil Blonsky/Abomination\n \n(uncredited)\nMark Ruffalo\n as \nBruce Banner\n \n(uncredited; mid-credits scene)\nBrie Larson\n as \nCarol Danvers/Captain Marvel\n \n(uncredited; mid-credits scene)\nDeborah An\n as \nYuki\n \n(uncredited)\nGianni Calchetti\n as \nJeff T\n \n(uncredited)\nUnknown Actor as \nTak\n \n(uncredited)\nUnknown Actor as \nExtremis Fighter\n \n(uncredicted)\nAppearances\n[\n]\nLocations\n[\n]\nEarth\nChina\nTen Rings Headquarters\nIron Gang Headquarters\nSan Francisco\n, \nCalifornia\nAlcatraz Island\nAlcatraz Federal Penitentiary\nShang-Chi's Apartment\nFairmont San Francisco\nChen Residence\nGolden Gate Bridge\nCoit Tower\nTransamerica Pyramid\nGhirardelli Square\nStockton Street Tunnel\nMacau\n, \nChina\nGolden Daggers Club\nCasino Lisboa\nDamage Control Supermax Prison\n, \nCalifornia\nKathmandu\n, \nNepal\nKamar-Taj\nLondon\n, \nEngland\n \n(flashback)\nMadripoor\n \n(flag)\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n \n(mentioned)\nHunan\n, \nChina\n \n(mentioned)\nRomania\n \n(mentioned)\nLiverpool\n, \nEngland\n \n(mentioned)\nSeagate Penitentiary\n \n(mentioned)\nAfghanistan\n \n(mentioned; deleted scene)\nMultiverse\nTa Lo\nAncient Village\nDark Gate\nEvents\n[\n]\nSiege of the Seljuk Mosque\nExpedition to Ta Lo\nSearch for Ta Lo\nAttack on Shang-Chi\nDuel at the Golden Daggers Club\nAttack on the Golden Daggers Club\nEscape from the Ten Rings Headquarters\nBattle of Ta Lo\nAttack on Ying Li\n \n(flashback)\nMassacre of the Iron Gang\n \n(flashback)\nAssassination of the Iron Gang Leader\n \n(flashback)\nSnap\n \n(mentioned)\nBlip\n \n(mentioned)\nAldrich Killian's False Flag Attacks\n \n(mentioned)\nBattle on the \nNorco\n \n(mentioned)\nKidnapping of Trevor Slattery\n \n(mentioned)\nItems\n[\n]\nTen Rings\nEyes of the Dragon\nDragon Scale\nDragon Scale Armor\nDragon Scale Collar\nDragon Scale Shield\nDragon Scale Staff\nDragon Scale Dao\nDragon Scale Podao\nDragon Scale Spear\nDragon Scale Bow and Arrows\nXu Xialing's Rope Dart\nRazor Fist's Prosthetic Blade\nDeath Dealer's Daggers\nHooked-Swords\nElectrified Crossbows\nSling Ring\nTao Mandalas\nInter-Dimensional Portal\nExtremis\nStarforce Uniform\nHulk Inhibitor Device\nCodex\nDance Dance Revolution\nLucky Charms\nVibranium\n \n(mentioned)\nConcepts\n[\n]\nMagic\nVehicles\n[\n]\nTen Rings Helicopter\nJeep\nBMW\nRazor Fist's Car\nFord Mustang\n \n(mentioned)\nSentient Species\n[\n]\nHumans\nKree\nChitauri\n \n(mentioned)\nCreatures\n[\n]\nDragons\nGreat Protector\nSoul Eaters\nDweller-in-Darkness\nDijiang\nMorris\nShishi\nFenghuang\nJiu Wei Hu\nQilin\nHorses\nDogs\n \n(animated and depictions)\nChickens\n \n(mentioned)\nPigs\n \n(mentioned)\nApes\n \n(mentioned)\nMonkeys\n \n(mentioned)\nOrganizations\n[\n]\nTen Rings\nTa Lo Armed Forces\nMasters of the Mystic Arts\nSan Francisco Transportations\nSeljuk Empire\n \n(flashbacks)\nBritish Empire\n \n(flashbacks)\nIron Gang\n \n(flashbacks)\nNational Blip Support Hotline\n \n(mentioned)\nBlip Sync\n \n(mentioned)\nNASCAR\n \n(mentioned)\nTalbots\n \n(mentioned)\nBBC\n \n(mentioned)\nMentioned\n[\n]\nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n \n(deleted scene)\nCaptain America\n \n(newspaper)\nKaty Chen\n's Father\nKaty Chen\n's Grandfather\nAldrich Killian\nIron Man\nJackson Norriss\n \n(indirectly)\nMs. Slattery\nThe Godfather\n \n(poster)\nKung Fu Hustle\n \n(poster)\nThe Warriors\n \n(poster)\nOutkast\nStankonia\n \n(poster)\nJeff Gordon\nGangnam Style\nMacbeth\nKing Duncan\nPlanet of the Apes\nKamehameha\nProduction\n[\n]\nIn 2001, \nStephen Norrington\n announced that he had agreed to direct a film based on the Marvel Comics character \nShang-Chi\n, describing it as \n\"a real honest-to-goodness martial arts film, rather than a film that simply has martial arts in it.\"\n[\n3\n]\nIn 2004, \nAng Lee\n announced that he would be a producer on the film.
