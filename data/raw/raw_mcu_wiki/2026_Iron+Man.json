And now, I'm a changed man. You can \ntake away\n my \nhouse\n, all my tricks and \ntoys\n. But one thing you can't take away I am Iron Man.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark\n was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the \nAvengers\n, and the former CEO of \nStark Industries\n. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the \ndeaths\n of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was \nkidnapped\n by the \nTen Rings\n in \nAfghanistan\n, while demonstrating a fleet of \nJericho\n missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an \narmored suit\n which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more \narmors\n to use against terrorists, as well as \nObadiah Stane\n who turned against Stark. Following his \nfight\n against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as \nIron Man\n.\nFresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own \nArc Reactor\n poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by \nIvan Vanko\n who attempted to destroy his legacy. After the \nStark Expo\n \nincident\n, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with \nPepper Potts\n. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the \nAvengers\n and helped defeat the \nChitauri\n and \nLoki\n. Due to the \nbattle\n, he suffered from \npost-traumatic stress disorder\n, leading him to create the \nIron Legion\n to safeguard the world and help him retire.\nThe \n2013\n \"\nMandarin\n\" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding \nAldrich Killian\n as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the \nClean Slate Protocol\n after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the \nWar on HYDRA\n, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of \nBaron Strucker\n and acquiring Loki's \nScepter\n.\nOnce the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by \nWanda Maximoff\n's visions, built \nUltron\n with the help of \nBruce Banner\n as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was \ndefeated\n, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which \nSokovia\n was elevated into the sky.\nAfter the \nUltron Offensive\n, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support the \nSokovia Accords\n. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally \nCaptain America\n when the latter began protecting the fugitive \nWinter Soldier\n, igniting the \nAvengers Civil War\n. The result left the Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to \nNew York\n to mentor and guide \nSpider-Man\n into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.\nIn \n2018\n, when \nThanos\n and the \nBlack Order\n invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six \nInfinity Stones\n, Stark, \nDoctor Strange\n, and \nSpider-Man\n convened to \nbattle\n Thanos on \nTitan\n with the help of the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the \nTime Stone\n for Stark's life. After the \nSnap\n, Stark and \nNebula\n remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the \nBenatar\n to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were \nrescued\n by \nCaptain Marvel\n, who brought them back to \nEarth\n.\nIn the \nfive years\n after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, \nMorgan\n. When Stark devised a method to \nsafely travel through time and space\n, he rejoined the Avengers in their \nmission\n to acquire the six \nInfinity Stones\n from the past in order to \nresurrect\n those killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to \nretrieve the Scepter\n and \nregain the Tesseract\n. During the \nBattle of Earth\n, Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of \nThanos\n and his army, who traveled through time to collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.\nContents\n1\n \nBiography\n1.1\n \nEarly Life\n1.1.1\n \nTroubled Childhood\n1.1.2\n \nLosing His

For an abridged overview, see \nMarvel Database's article on the same character\n.\nEarly Life\n[\n]\nTroubled Childhood\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is yelled at by his \nfather\n \n \n\"What do you remember about \nyour dad\n?\"\n\"He was cold. He was calculating. He never told me he loved me, he never even told me he liked me. So it's a bit hard for me to digest that he said the whole 'future is riding on me' thing, I don't get that. You're talking about a man whose happiest day of his life was shipping me off to \nboarding school\n.\"\n\nNick Fury\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark was born on Friday, \nMay 29, 1970\n, in Manhattan, \nNew York City\n, to \nHoward\n and \nMaria Stark\n. Stark's early life was often dominated by the absence of his father, who he would later describe as both 'cold' and 'calculating'. Growing up, Stark had issues with Howard, who never told his son that he loved, or even liked him. Since Stark was so young, Howard could not tell his son his plans for him.\n[\n12\n]\n Howard constantly talked about his admiration for \nCaptain America\n, which caused Stark to develop hatred and resentment towards the super soldier.\n[\n15\n]\n On one occasion, a young Stark was playing with a remote control car when he accidentally drove the tiny toy into Howard's foot. Howard slapped it out of his hand in a fit of rage and told him to not have him deal with any nonsense. Stark ran outside and repeated that he wanted to go back to school. His butler, \nEdwin Jarvis\n, comforted him, saying that a father and son relationship is difficult to maneuver from both sides.\n[\n16\n]\n On another, his father scolded him for playing with his toys on the \nStark Expo\n map during Howard's filming of the advertisement.\n[\n12\n]\n However, Stark had a loving relationship with his mother, who was more gentle and nurturing; he enjoyed hearing Maria play the piano.\n[\n6\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark's ingenuity is recognized as a child\n \n \nAt a young age, Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. When he was four years old, he designed his first circuit board. When he was almost seven, he built a V8 motorbike engine.\n[\n3\n]\n One thing about Stark's childhood that annoyed him was the nanny who cared for him until he was fourteen.\n[\n4\n]\n Stark attended \nPhillips Academy\n in \nAndover\n from \n1977\n to \n1984\n.\n[\n9\n]\n While he was in high school, Stark hacked into the \nPentagon\n on a dare by some friends.\n[\n5\n]\n In 1984, he was admitted early into \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n, where he met \nJames Rhodes\n and they became lifelong best friends.\n[\n3\n]\n At sixteen, Stark won the 4th Annual MIT Robot Design Award,\n[\n17\n]\n which was his fourth consecutive time winning, after inventing robots which he name \nDum-E and U\n. In \n1987\n,\n[\n9\n]\n when he was seventeen, Stark graduated at the top of his class from MIT\n[\n18\n]\n and was awarded \nsumma cum laude\n.\n[\n3\n]\n Twelve hours after arriving home from graduation, Howard talked with Stark, who was outside getting a tan in the pool. Howard pushed his son to start doing things in life, but Tony pushed him away, saying that he has a plan. \nEdwin Jarvis\n reminded him that he and Maria needed to go. As Howard left, Tony slipped off his raft into the pool. Sometime later, Stark's long-serving family butler, Edwin Jarvis, died.\n[\n19\n]\nLosing His Parents\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark in his final moments with \nhis\n \nparents\n \n \n\"I never got to say goodbye to \nmy father\n. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what \nhis company\n did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nIn \nDecember 1991\n, when Stark was just twenty-one years old, he arrived home for Christmas after studying abroad. \nHoward\n and \nMaria\n prepared to go away to the \nBahamas\n for a few days over the Christmas holiday and leave him home alone, although his father remained skeptical about how responsible Stark would be while they were gone. The couple was \nassassinated\n by the \nWinter Soldier\n in Long Island and \nHYDRA\n covered up the incident to be a car crash, leaving Stark in grief and struggling to process this tragedy.\n[\n6\n]\n Stark was notified of the event the following morning and cooperated with the authorities.\n[\n20\n]\n As he stood before his parent's caskets, he said that this wasn't part of his plan.\n[\n19\n]\n For a short while, \nObadiah Stane\n took over as interim CEO of \nStark Industries\n.\n[\n3\n]\nCEO of Stark Industries\n[\n]\nRebuilding the Company\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is made the CEO of \nStark Industries\n \n \n\"With the keys to the \nkingdom\n, Tony ushers in a new era for \nhis father\n's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry, by ensuring freedom and protecting \nAmerica\n.\"\nAward Ceremony\n[src]\nIn \n1992\n, the month after the death of his parents, Stark inherited \nStark Industries\n and took over from \nObadiah Stane\n, becoming the youngest CEO of a \nFortune 500\n company in history. Having built himself a \ncustom mansion\n, Stark created an A.I. system that helped out in the house. He named the system \"Just a Rather Very Intelligent System,\" shortened \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n, in tribute to \nEdwin Jarvis\n, whom Stark had often credited for helping to raise him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark working alongside \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nEventually, \nJames Rhodes\n, now a member of the \nUnited States Air Force\n, became the liaison between Stark Industries and the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n, successfully earning Stark billions of dollars with military contracts. Under Stark's leadership with the aid of Stane, Stark Industries quickly thrived and became one of the most advanced companies in the world, creating new forms of weapons technology that seemed highly futuristic to most looking on at the weapons.\n[\n3\n]\nCreating Demons\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark meets \nHo Yinsen\n in \nBern\n in \n1999\n \n \n\"I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"I'll ditch these clowns. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.\"\nTony Stark and \nAldrich Killian\n[src]\nOn New Year's Eve in \n1999\n, Stark, with his scientist paramour \nMaya Hansen\n, attended the \nBern 2000\n science conference in \nBern\n, \nSwitzerland\n. There, Stark got so drunk he could barely give his speech on integrated circuits and rejoined the party as soon as possible. While celebrating, he met a scientist named \nHo Yinsen\n who introduced Stark to Doctor \nWu\n, although he swiftly dismissed them both.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark lies directly to \nAldrich Killian\n \n \nWhile moving through the hotel with his bodyguard \nHappy Hogan\n, Hansen, and a group of female attendees, Stark then arrogantly avoided a gifted but crippled scientist, \nAldrich Killian\n, who wanted his financial backing for a scientific think tank, \nAdvanced Idea Mechanics\n. Once they were alone in an elevator together, Stark then purposely told the excited Killian to meet him on the rooftop of the building to discuss him working with \nStark Industries\n with the intention of never turning up, wanting to continue spending time with Hansen.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discussing \nMaya Hansen\n's research\n \n \nBack in Hansen's hotel room, Stark looked at her new research into a project known as \nExtremis\n, which had the potential to regrow human limbs if she could get enough funding. Stark was amazed by the concept, although Hogan was less impressed and played with a nearby plant despite being told not to. Stark and Hansen then went to her bedroom where they continued flirting with each other before then leaning towards one another for a passionate kiss.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark leaves \nMaya Hansen\n a secret note\n \n \nHowever, Hogan inadvertently caused a small explosion by breaking a plant stem, causing a brief moment of panic. Stark sent Hogan away and then slept with Hansen, leaving Killian freezing and humiliated on the rooftop. Stark was unaware of Killian's suffering and woke up the next morning while Hansen was working. He completed her formula for her to fix the combustible glitch in Extremis, before discreetly walking out and returning home, leaving Hansen behind.\n[\n4\n]\nTesting Weapons in Arizona\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark demonstrates his weapons for the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n \n \n\"I hate when people tell me my place. Which reminds me, \nCeleste\n, \nEloise\n, let's go see \nmy place\n!\"\nTony Stark to \nJames Rhodes\n, \nCeleste\n and \nEloise\n[src]\nIn \n2008\n, Stark accepted an offer to appear on \nWired\n. A magazine about him eventually released in January.\n[\n3\n]\n Stark and \nJames Rhodes\n went to a weapons demonstration at the \nYuma Proving Ground\n, where Stark showed off his product's accelerated wave explosion capability, or \"AWE.\" \nPepper Potts\n then gave the weapon's specifics to the generals while Stark and Rhodes went to a nightclub. Stark enjoyed the company of two girls, \nCeleste\n and \nEloise\n, while Rhodes tried to convince him not to go to \nAfghanistan\n for the demonstration of \nJericho\n. While dancing, Stark was attacked by a man whose girlfriend he had previously seduced, but Rhodes was able to defeat the attacker. Stark declared that he would be alright in Afghanistan thanks to his friend having his back. Stark, Rhodes and the girls then went to \nhis mansion\n to continue their party.\n[\n21\n]\nApogee Award\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark celebrates with \nHappy Hogan\n \n \n\"Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?\"\n\"Nobody roped me into anything! But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honoured.\"\n\"Of course I'd be deeply honoured. And it's you, that's great.\"\nTony Stark and \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nA month later, Stark accepted the Apogee Award which was accompanied by a celebration of his life thus far. Therefore, Stark went to \nLas Vegas\n to go to the ceremony at \nCaesars Palace\n. While the presentation went on, Stark sneaked off from the banquet hall and soon found himself at the craps table. With a cluster of on-lookers, Stark rolled a good number and celebrated with two women before proceeding to head butt \nHappy Hogan\n's chest.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nJames Rhodes\n argue\n \n \nStark was interrupted by Colonel \nJames Rhodes\n, who interjected, calling Stark unbelievable. Stark sarcastically showed his disbelief that they Apogee Award people roped Rhodes into the presentation. Rhodes assured him that he was not roped into anything and was simply told Stark would be honored if he presented him with the award. Stark showed is gratitude and asked when they were doing it. Rhodes revealed that presentation already happened and gave Stark the trophy, to which Stark remarked how easy it was. However, Stark was indifferent to the award and simply handed it off to the woman next to it before placing his bet.\n \n \n \n \n \nJames Rhodes\n and Stark part ways for the evening\n \n \nStark then took the die and asked the woman to blow on it, which she did. In a joking fashion, Stark asked Rhodes to do the same. However, Rhodes refused saying he did not blow on another man's dice and instead slapped Stark's hand away, causing him to roll. Much to Rhodes disinterest, Stark ended up losing the hand which did not bother him as he simply asked to cash out. On the way out of the casino with his entourage, Rhodes reminded Stark of his presentation tomorrow and said not to be late. Stark gave a passive agreement before handing his Apogee Award trophy to the \nJulius Ceasar\n mascot.\n[\n3\n]\nInterview with Christine Everhart\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark being interviewed by \nChristine Everhart\n \n \n\"I guarantee the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\"\n\"You rehearse that much?\"\n\"Every night in front of the mirror before bed time.\"\nTony Stark and \nChristine Everhart\n[src]\nWhile getting into his car, Stark heard his name from afar and looked up to find \nChristine Everhart\n from \nVanity Fair\n. Stark asked \nHappy Hogan\n if she was cute, which Hogan partially confirmed, making Stark turn around to take interview questions. Everhart started firing off questions, asking what Stark thought of his nickname \"the \nDiVinci\n of our time\". Stark refuted it, saying he did not paint. However, he was a fan of his other nickname, \"The merchant of death\". He then got sidetracked, guessing that Everhart went to \nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n, only for her to say she went to \nBrown University\n. \n \n \n \n \n \nStark argues with \nChristine Everhart\n \n \nNow referring to Everhart as \"Ms. Brown\", Stark said that once weapons were no longer needed, he would resort to making bricks and beams for baby hospitals. Everhart was not a fan of this answer, asking if he rehearsed it, to which Stark confirmed, claiming he did so every night before bed. When Everhart asked for a serious answer, Stark gave her one, saying that his \nfather\n's saying was \"peace was having a bigger stick than the other guy.\" She refuted saying that Stark was the one selling the sticks. Stark defended his father, saying he worked on the \nManhattan Project\n and fought Nazis, which many would call being a hero. Everhart fought back one again, calling it war profiteering.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nChristine Everhart\n make out\n \n \nHaving enough, Stark took off his glasses and called out Everhart, asking if she planned on talking about the millions \nStark Industries\n had saved by advancing medical technology as well as keeping the world from starvation. Everhart asked if he had ever lost an hour of sleep in his life to which Stark replied that he was willing to lose some with her. In true Stark fashion, this made Everhart agree to go \nhome\n with him where they spent the night. While having sex, Stark let out a laugh as they fell off his bed.\n[\n3\n]\nFinal Hours of Freedom\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark works on his \nFord Flathead Roadster\n \n \n\"You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.\"\n\"It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.\"\n\nJames Rhodes\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nIn the morning, Stark woke up early, apathetic in his agreement to meet with \nJames Rhodes\n at \nStark Industries Aviation Division\n. Instead, he left \nChristine Everhart\n in bed and went to his garage to work on his \nFord Flathead Roadster\n. Taking apart the engine, Stark asked \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to give him an expanded view of the inside and was told that the compression in cylinder three was low. Stark made sure that J.A.R.V.I.S. logged that note.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to \nPepper Potts\n \n \nStark's music was then turned down, causing him to get annoyed as he told \nPepper Potts\n not to do that. Potts ignored his comment, telling Stark he should be in \nAfghanistan\n by now. Stark returned the favor and ignored her, instead he asked if Everhart made a problem out of leaving so soon. He then asked why Potts was trying to hustle him out of there to which Potts responded that his \nplane\n was supposed to leave an hour ago. Stark responded with confusion that if it was his plane, it should wait for him. Potts then listed off answers she needed, including questioning if Stark wanted a \nJackson Pollack\n painting from \nLarry\n. Stark decided to buy it and store it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says his goodbyes to \nPepper Potts\n \n \nPotts also reminded him of an \nMIT\n speech, which Stark knew was in June, asking her not to bother him about stuff so far in the future. Instead, he asked her to deflect the offers until later. With Stark questioning her, Potts revealed she had plans because it was her birthday. Stark wished her a happy birthday and told her to get herself something from him, which she said she already did. Finally leaving his home, Stark raced \nHappy Hogan\n to the airport.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHappy Hogan\n arrive at \nStark Industries Aviation Division\n \n \nGetting to the plane, Stark watched as Hogan pulled in after. Stark claimed he believed he lost Hogan, which the latter confirmed he did and he had to take a shortcut. As they walked up to the plane, Rhodes started ripping into Stark for breaking the promise he made the night before. Stark thought nothing of it, saying he got stuck doing a piece for \nVanity Fair\n. Rhodes was left speechless. The plane lifted off as a stewardess helped Stark with refreshments. \n \n \n \n \n \nStark argues with \nJames Rhodes\n on the plane\n \n \nMeanwhile, Stark and Rhodes argued about Stark's tendencies with Rhodes calling him out for making him feel like a babysitter. Rhodes' words did nothing for Stark as he ignored them and asked \nTrixie\n for sake. This prompted Rhodes to order the stewardesses not to get them because they were working. Of course, the women did not listen to Rhodes and got out the drinks. Before long, Stark and Rhodes found themselves drunk on the plane listening to music. As Rhodes talked about how being an airman meant to him as his allies had his back, Stark got distracted by a pole rising up from the ground.\n[\n3\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark having breakfast\n \n \nTrixie then approached Stark and, with his consent, blindfolded him. Stark then said to Rhodes that Trixie has his back and he was going to go into the other room for a second. In the morning, Stark sat at the table eating breakfast and reading the newspaper as Rhodes sat hungover. Rhodes claimed he was going to get some rest, but was stopped by a stewardess saying that they were about to land and they needed to take their seats.\n[\n22\n]\nPresenting the Jericho\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark presenting the new \nJericho\n missile\n \n \n\"They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how \nDad\n did it, that's how \nAmerica\n does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far.\"\nTony Stark to \nUnited States Air Force\n[src]\nTouching down in \nAfghanistan\n, Stark was greeted by members of the military before he presented \nStark Industries\n' newest weapon, the \nJericho\n missile, to the military spectators and demonstrated its capability. Giving a speech, Stark explained that the missile was so powerful that it would only be needed to be fired once to defeat the enemy, noting that was how his father, \nHoward Stark\n, had worked and it was a successful method for all of \nAmerica\n. The missile was fired and Stark received a round of applause from everyone.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark makes a toast to world peace\n \n \nAfter the successful presentation, Stark had a drink, noting that the whiskey came with every order of the Jericho missile. While all of the various members of the \nUnited States Air Force\n celebrated the new deal, \nObadiah Stane\n called Stark to ask how it had gone, with Stark explaining that they would be getting an early Christmas. Stark got into a convoy vehicle to leave, sending \nJames Rhodes\n to another Humvee to then go and return to their military base.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark jokes with the various \nmilitary soldiers\n \n \nAs they drove down the road towards the military base, Stark sat with his whiskey as three soldiers sat with him in awkward silence and attempted to make small talk. Stark teased them, noting that he would have never guessed that the driver was a woman as he was asked all about sleeping with various supermodels before he was asked to take a selfie. Posing for the picture, Stark muttered about loving peace while jokingly asking \nJimmy Ryan\n not to make gang signs.\n[\n3\n]\nBecoming Iron Man\n[\n]\nKidnapped by the Ten Rings\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark being ambushed by the \nTen Rings\n \n \n\"What you just saw That is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work in the hands of \nthose murderers\n. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\"\n\nHo Yinsen\n to Tony Stark\n[src]\nAs Stark's convoy drove through \nAfghanistan\n to return to the \nUnited States Air Force\n base, they were suddenly attacked by insurgents who blew up the vehicle in front, trapping them. Stark watched in utter horror as the soldiers stepped out only to be gunned down right in front of his own eyes, leaving his ears ringing from the many explosions. While soldiers were dying around him, Stark rushed outside and attempted to find some cover and call for help.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is nearly killed by his own \nmissile\n \n \nWhile Stark was using his phone in his attempt to contact someone for assistance, one of \nStark Industries\n' own \nmissiles\n suddenly landed right by him, Stark saw this and desperately attempted to get away; however, he was too slow, and the bomb exploded right beside him. The resulting blast caused Stark to be thrown backward and lose consciousness. The explosion embedded several pieces of shrapnel into his chest, several fragments dangerously close to his heart.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is held hostage by the \nTen Rings\n \n \nWhile falling in and out of consciousness, Stark felt incredible pain as an operation was performed on his chest in an attempt to remove the pieces of shrapnel and save his life. Eventually, Stark dazed away to find himself in front of a camera as some various terrorists of the \nTen Rings\n were now reading out a ransom note to an \nunknown viewer\n while Stark could only look on in dismay with various guns aimed directly at him. The shock of seeing this made Stark lose consciousness again.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark awakes inside a \nsecret hidden cave\n \n \nHe woke up sometime later to find \nHo Yinsen\n in his cell in a \ncave\n with him and an electromagnet attached to his chest. Hooked up to a car battery, Yinsen explained that the electromagnet was keeping the shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him. Yinsen went on to explain how they had once met in \nBern\n during the \n1999\n although Stark had been too drunk to remember. Just as Stark questioned where they were, someone banged on the door from the other side.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is threatened by \nAbu Bakaar\n \n \nAs Yinsen ordered Stark to get onto his feet, they were greeted by \nAbu Bakaar\n, who had Yinsen translate as he welcomed Stark as the greatest mass murderer in the entire history of the \nUnited States of America\n. Bakaar explained that he now wanted Stark to rebuild the \nJericho\n missile for him, however, Stark simply refused to help them. As a direct result of refusing to help the Ten Rings, Bakaar had Stark tortured by waterboarding him repeatedly.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark explores the \nTen Rings\n' \nsecret base\n \n \nStark was then taken outside of the cave where Bakaar showed him how the Ten Rings had an incredible supply of his Stark Industries weapons, including guns and missiles which were being used against the United States Armed Forces, which clearly horrified Stark. As Bakaar continued his earlier conversation, he told Stark that they had all the materials needed for him to build a Jericho missile, promising that if he began immediately then once he was done, he would be returned home. Stark agreed to the job, although he noted to Yinsen that Bakaar would never actually allow him to get away, with Yinsen confirming that this was true while Bakaar smile at them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHo Yinsen\n discuss losing hope\n \n \nWhile Stark sat by the fire and considered his new and terrible situation, Yinsen joined him and explained that what he had seen out there, with the Ten Rings holding his weapons, was the legacy of Tony Stark. When Yinsen called on him to do something, Stark simply questioned what the point was if he was likely going to be dead within a week regardless of anything, so Yinsen told him that this only meant it was an important week for him.\n[\n3\n]\nBuilding the First Armor\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHo Yinsen\n working together\n \n \n\"It is a miniaturized \nArc Reactor\n. \nWe\n got a big one powering my \nfactory\n at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\"\n\"But what could it generate?\"\n\"If my math is right, and it always is three gigajoules per second.\"\nTony Stark and \nHo Yinsen\n[src]\nKnowing their captors would never keep up their end of the deal, Stark began the work asked from him with \nHo Yinsen\n; however, he had instead begun to make a plan to escape the \nTen Rings Base\n. Stark recruited \nAbu Bakaar\n to bring in the supplies he needed into their cave, using Yinsen as his translator while he began breaking all of the various weapons apart.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark successfully recreates an \nArc Reactor\n \n \nIn order to improve Stark's condition, he and Yinsen then created a miniature \nArc Reactor\n, a smaller version of the same power source previously invented by his father, \nHoward Stark\n, and \nAnton Vanko\n. Stark concentrated on his own technical work, all while Yinsen continued to tell Stark everything he knew of the \nTen Rings\n and what their plans were for them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shows off his \nescape plan\n \n \nHaving successfully built the Arc Reactor, Stark told Yinsen that he would not be using it to power his heart, but to power something larger for a brief time. With that Stark showed Yinsen his plans, hidden with multiple blueprints, to build a \nsuit of armor\n which he would soon be using to finally break them out of the cave and escape the Ten Rings' base. Yinsen was both impressed and inspired by Stark's plan and then assisted him in installing the Arc Reactor inside his chest to supply energy to the electromagnet protecting his heart.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHo Yinsen\n discuss their families\n \n \nDuring their downtime, Stark and Yinsen played board games to keep themselves entertained. During one of their games, Stark asked Yinsen where he was from, as Yinsen explained he was from a small town called \nGulmira\n where he had a family who he intended to see once he was free from the base. When Yinsen then asked the same question, Stark admitted that he had no family waiting for him, with Yinsen noting he had everything but yet still nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark continues building his \narmored suit\n \n \nStark and Yinsen then returned to their work, pulling apart pieces of the various \nStark Industries\n weapons that were supplied to them and tearing them apart. They then fused the pieces together and turned them into plates ready to be added to the armor once that was completed. However, the pair ensured that their work was still kept random enough that the Ten Rings would be unable to figure out their deception until it was at last too late for them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is personally threatened by \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n \n \nTheir work was one day interrupted by \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n, the leader of this Ten Rings group who told Stark to relax before admiring his Arc Reactor. Al-Wazar compared Stark's work to that of \nGenghis Khan\n who had almost conquered the world. Believing they were lying to him, al-Wazar had Yinsen held down and threatened to put a red-hot coal in his mouth until Stark told him to stop. Al-Wazar agreed and then ordered Stark to finally complete the \nJericho\n missile by the very next day.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shows the \narmor helmet\n to \nHo Yinsen\n \n \nFearing for their lives if they did not get out as soon as possible, together, Stark and Yinsen secretly began building the final stages of the armored suit to help them escape, with Stark focusing on the body of the armor while Yinsen wired up the final pieces of the mechanics. Fusing together the various large parts of steel to fit his own body, Stark then fitting the armor with various missiles and flame throwers, preparing himself for every eventuality as he knew al-Wazar and the Ten Rings would put all their strength into stopping their escape. Once it was almost complete, Stark placed the still steaming Iron Man helmet onto Yinsen's desk and they prepared to finally put their upcoming escape plan into action.\n[\n3\n]\nEscaping the Ten Rings\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is fitted with his \nfirst armor\n \n \n\"Thank you for saving me.\"\n\"Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.\"\nTony Stark and \nHo Yinsen\n[src]\nSoon, the pair enacted their escape plan the \nTen Rings Base\n with Stark being slowly fitted into the \narmored suit\n while the power from the new \nArc Reactor\n was being downloaded into the suit. However, the booby-trapped door the pair had rigged with an explosive was set off, killing all the men who had come to check on their progress. To his horror, \nHo Yinsen\n realized that they now did not have enough time to power the suit before the \nTen Rings\n soldiers would arrive and kill them. With no other choice, Yinsen took a gun and held back the terrorists, while Stark's suit still continued to power up.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fights the \nTen Rings\n terrorists\n \n \nOnce the suit had power, Stark waited in the shadows as Ten Rings terrorists arrived in the room and searched for them, at which point he revealed himself and used all of his new incredible strength to punch them across the room, with the armor being unaffected by their bullets. Stark began making his way through the cave, killing any Ten Rings terrorist he came across by striking them with his armor. When Stark accidentally trapped his metal arm in a rock-strewn wall, a terrorist attempted to kill him by shooting him point-blank in the head, only for Stark's helmet to deflect the bullet and kill the terrorist instead, giving Stark time to free himself and continue forward on his escape mission.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fires a missile at \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n \n \nComing around a corner near the exit, Stark was mortified to find Yinsen lying mortally wounded having been shot multiple times during the escape attempt. However, Yinsen was just able to warn Stark before \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n fired a \nrocket launcher\n at his former hostage. Stark managed to dodge the shot and returned fire, shooting a missile at the Ten Rings leader which caused him to be badly burnt and trapped underneath the heavy falling rubble.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says his last goodbye to \nHo Yinsen\n \n \nStark rushed to Yinsen's side and urged him to get back on his feet so he could go to \nGulmira\n to be reunited with his family. However, Yinsen revealed his family was already dead and he would see them at last in the afterlife. Forced to accept the inevitable, Stark thanked Yinsen for everything he had done for him in saving his life, both physically and morally. With his last words, Yinsen reassured Stark that it would be alright to leave him behind and urged him not to waste his life.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark burns down the \nTen Rings\n' \nbase\n \n \nAngered by Yinsen's death, Stark stepped outside to confront the rest of the terrorists who were waiting for him; the suit protected him from the onslaught of bullets, and he then used the suit's flamethrowers to kill several terrorists, and destroy their stockpile of \nStark Industries\n weapons which he despised for being stolen from him to be used against the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n, causing several massive fireball explosions to erupt all around him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark manages to finally make his escape\n \n \nDue to the massive amount of bullets being fired at him, the armored suit was eventually badly damaged by the gunfire, forcing Stark to escape using the jetpacks while the entire base erupted in a massive fireball. Stark soared above the blast, though his suit began to fall apart and was finally destroyed as he crashed in the desert, although it still saved him from the impact. With no other need for it, Stark left the suit's remains in the desert.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is found and saved by \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nStark began making his way through the desert, using his jacket to protect himself from the intense heat until finally, a \nUnited States Air Force\n helicopter flew overhead. Stark yelled out for help and collapsed to his knees, wearily making a peace symbol in the air. \nJames Rhodes\n then rushed out of the helicopter with the military and the two friends embraced each other. Rhodes urged Stark to ride with him next time before taking him to safety. Upon being picked up by the Air Force, Stark was then finally returned to the \nUnited States of America\n at long last.\n[\n3\n]\nNo More Weapons\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark returns \nhome\n after his \nkidnapping\n \n \n\"I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them, and I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nHaving been rescued, Stark was brought back to the \nUnited States\n by the army where he was walked onto a military airport by \nJames Rhodes\n. To Stark's disgust, there was a stretcher waiting to take him to the hospital, which he rejected. Stark then met with \nPepper Potts\n, who he noted had been crying, teasing her as he claimed she was crying for her long-lost boss, while she claimed it was simply because she was glad not to have to find a new job.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark demands to get a cheeseburger\n \n \nStark then sat in \nHappy Hogan\n's car with Potts who insisted that he go straight to the hospital to check himself over the wake of \nhis kidnapping\n. However, Stark once again refused to get any medical treatment and instead asked to first be given a burger, then called a press meeting for \nStark Industries\n. Potts argued that this was a very bad idea in the wake of his traumatic ordeal, but Stark still remained insistent, noting that he must get his cheeseburger first.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark stops all \nStark Industries\n weapons\n \n \nUpon arriving at \nStark Industries Headquarters\n, Stark was then enthusiastically greeted by \nObadiah Stane\n before making his way inside. During the press meeting, Stark finished his burger and compared his experiences to how he never said goodbye to his father, \nHoward Stark\n. Stark finally declared that his company would now, for the foreseeable future, no longer manufacture military weapons, which Stane tried to slow down to the best of his own abilities.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shows \nObadiah Stane\n the \nArc Reactor\n \n \nAs their companies' stock market began to plummet, Stark had a meeting with Stane beside the giant \nArc Reactor\n. Stane advised him to reconsider the decision as he feared it would ruin the company. Stark insisted that they should take another look at the Arc Reactor technology based on his work with \nHo Yinsen\n, proving this theory by showing Stane the Arc Reactor in his chest that was now keeping him alive. Although Stane insisted that the Arc Reactor was designed by Howard and \nAnton Vanko\n as a publicity stunt, he eventually agreed to help Stark provided he inform Stane of his next intentions before calling for sudden, unexpected press conferences.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark requests \nPepper Potts\n' assistance\n \n \nWhile back inside his \nMalibu\n \nmansion\n, Stark called upon the help of Potts to get rid of the expired Arc Reactor in his chest, as \nDum-E and U\n were unable to assist him. Although Potts was initially skeptical about the idea, she helped him at removing the Arc Reactor, although she accidentally put him through cardiac arrest briefly. Once they were finished, Stark told Potts he only had her to help and told her to bin the Reactor as he no longer had any more use for it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells \nJames Rhodes\n about his \nproject\n \n \nStark went to meet with Rhodes who was giving a speech to new members of the \nUnited States Air Force\n. Stark interrupted the talk and teased his friend who then ordered the men to leave them in peace. When Rhodes questioned what Stark was doing there, he was told that Stark was working on a big \nnew project\n, which seemed to delight him until Stark revealed it was not military. Rhodes then recommended that Stark get his mind straight instead.\n[\n3\n]\nSuit Upgrades\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark begins building his \nnew armor\n \n \n\"You and your new direction isn't in the \ncompany\n's best interest.\"\n\"I'm being responsible, that's a new direction for me for the company. I mean me on the company's behalf being responsible.\"\n\nObadiah Stane\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nIn the months that followed, Stark retreated from public view and spent much of his time in \nhis mansion\n, focusing on improving the design of his \nnew armored suit\n, refining its size, movement, and flight capability far beyond the \nfirst design\n. Stark was aided in building the new suit by \nDum-E and U\n who he had constantly mocked and insulted.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark does his first test flight\n \n \nRecalling how the first armor had almost no flight control and had crashed upon escaping the \nTen Rings Base\n, Stark decided to create a more controlled flight capability for his suit. He arranged a test with U filming and Dum-E ready with the fire extinguisher in case anything went wrong. Stark proceeded with the test, although Stark was only on five to ten percent power, he quickly discovered it was vastly more powerful than he expected and he was launched straight up and painfully crashed into the ceiling, prompting Dum-E to spray Stark with the fire extinguisher upon him landing on the ground, thinking he caught fire.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark builds stabilizers for the \nnew armor\n \n \nMaking some redesigns to the new armor, Stark developed new stabilizers that would attach to his hands and give him a new level of control while in the air. While testing out the new designs, Stark was visited by \nPepper Potts\n who mistakenly believed Stark was designing new weapons for \nStark Industries\n which he then denied, claiming that this design was not a weapon but it was completely harmless. However, Stark had once again underestimated the power of the design and a single blast from the stabilizer sent him flying backward, much to Potts' horror. Shocked by this, Stark noted he was not expecting that and began making adjustments.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark making an argument for his actions\n \n \nStepping upstairs, Stark found \nObadiah Stane\n had joined Potts for pizza having returned from a meeting with Stark Industries' board of directors. Stane informed Stark that the board had decided to block Stark out of the company in the wake of \nhis kidnapping\n, believing he was now suffering from \nPTSD\n. Stark argued the decision but was told it was final, with Stane then requesting to take a look at the \nArc Reactor\n technology, which Stark refused to do.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark does his second test flight\n \n \nGetting back to work, Stark had the second test of his new incomplete Mark II armor, with Dum-E and U assisting him once again while \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n watched. Using a lot less power than his first test, Stark hovered around his basement, struggling to maintain any control and almost damaging some of his most expensive cars. Eventually, Stark ended the test and landed, ordering Dum-E not to use the fire extinguisher on him before proudly declaring that he could now fly.\n[\n3\n]\nOutdoor Test Flight\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares for his first outdoor flight\n \n \n\"All right, let's see what \nthis thing\n can do. What's \nSR-71\n's record?\"\n\"The altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\"\n\"Records are made to be broken.\"\nTony Stark and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nStark eventually perfected the flight power after much trial and error, taking the silver \nMark II Armor\n for its initial test flight as Stark put on the armor for the first time with great pride and excitement. Despite \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n' warnings that there had not been enough tests to be safe, Stark insisted upon being allowed to fly outside and fully test its true capabilities.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark testing the \nMark II\n's flight capabilities\n \n \nStark cheered in utter delight as he soared high across the sky over \nCalifornia\n and shouted out in gratification at his success, using the mask's system to zoom into the city where a young boy looked on in amazement upon seeing Stark. However, when he pushed the suit to see how high he could fly in an attempt to beat the \nLockheed SR-71 Blackbird\n's record, he learned the suit would freeze at such a high altitude, which disabled its power. Stark fell from the sky, only being able to restart the suit moments before nearly hitting the ground, with Stark exhilarated at avoiding such a near miss.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark crash lands through \nhis mansion\n \n \nHaving gained all the information about the suit's capabilities that he needed, Stark flew back to his \nmansion\n, where he then prepared to analyze the data to use in the next design. Stark hovered over the entrance of the mansion and prepared to land softly on the ground; however, he did not account for the suit's extra weight and promptly fell through the ceiling, destroying his piano and sports car. Upon crash landing, \nDum-E\n once again sprayed Stark with the fire extinguisher, believing him to have caught fire upon the impact while Stark leaned his head back in both pain and frustration.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finds \nPepper Potts\n' \npresent\n for him\n \n \nExploring his lap, Stark soon found that \nPepper Potts\n had left a gift for him on his desk. Opening the box, Stark found his original \nArc Reactor\n had been framed with an attached message stating that it was proof that he had a heart.\n[\n3\n]\nObadiah Stane's Betrayal\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns he was not invited to his party\n \n \n\"Have you seen this pictures? What's going on?\"\n\"Tony, you can't afford to be this naive.\"\n\"I was naive before, when they said: Here's the line, we don't cross it, this is how we do business. If we're double-dealing under the table are we?\"\nTony Stark and \nObadiah Stane\n[src]\nWhile giving \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n his plans to improve the \nMark III Armor\n in order to fix the icing problems and improve the flight controls, Stark noticed a news report in which \nZorianna Kit\n was reporting on a new charity event at the \nWalt Disney Concert Hall\n which Stark was now supposedly hosting. Stark questioned J.A.R.V.I.S. if he had been invited to the event to which J.A.R.V.I.S. then confirmed he had not, so Stark left his A.I. to complete the Mark III while he got himself ready to attend.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark greeting \nObadiah Stane\n at his party\n \n \nDuring his first public appearance since his return to the \nUnited States of America\n, Stark arrived at his own party to be greeted by the press, having an attractive woman trying to speak to him who Stark quickly dismissed as he did not remember her before complimenting the \nWatcher Informant\n who he had mistaken for \nHugh Hefner\n. Stark had soon found \nObadiah Stane\n talking to the press as Stane expressed his surprise to see that Stark had arrived, advising him not to draw too much unwanted attention to himself as Stane was still trying to get the board of directors on their side. Stark promised to do so as he stepped inside the building, but Stane was unconvinced.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is introduced to Agent \nPhil Coulson\n \n \nOnce inside, Stark met \nPhil Coulson\n, who introduced himself as an Agent of the \nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division\n, with Stark noting that the name of the organization was far too long while Coulson noted that they were now planning on shortening it. The pair soon arranged to have a meeting to discuss all the events of \nhis kidnapping\n, but Stark was still not paying very much attention to him and told him to arrange it through his own team.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shares a dance with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nStark, however, was too distracted by seeing \nPepper Potts\n, who he saw in the center of the room wearing a blue dress. Having said goodbye to Coulson, Stark went up to Potts and complimented her on her dress, which she noted she had bought as a present from Stark using his money. Despite Potts' protests, Stark took her onto the dance floor and danced with her, as Potts worried about being seen dancing with her boss. They joked about Stark firing her to make it less uncomfortable, but Potts noted that Stark wouldn't be able to survive without her assistance, questioning if he knew his own social security number which admitted he did not.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shares a moment with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nStepping outside, Potts confronted Stark about pushing her to dance with her while in front of all her coworkers due to Stark's reputation with women and fearing that her intentions with the dance would be misinterpreted by any who had watched them while Stark continued to argue that it was not really a big deal. As they spoke, the pair then almost kissed one another before Stark decided to go and get them both a drink, with Potts requesting a heavy drink.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns \nStark Industries\n' shipments\n \n \nWhile ordering all the drinks for himself and Potts, Stark was then accosted by \nChristine Everhart\n, whose name he briefly forgot despite them having slept together. Everhart expressed her disgust at Stark for claiming to halt the weapons development only to sell weapons to the \nTen Rings\n. When Stark revealed he did not approve any shipments, Everhart informed him that his company did.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns about \nObadiah Stane\n's betrayal\n \n \nDisgusted by this, Stark confronted \nObadiah Stane\n and demanded to know if he was making deals with \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n as well as the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n. Stane refused to answer the question; however, he called Stark nave for not considering that this sort of thing could possibly be happening. Stane also revealed that he was the one to shut Stark out of the board while he recovered. Stane then left the party, leaving Stark in a state of utter shock and horror over the fact that his close friend betrayed him.\n[\n3\n]\nBattle of Gulmira\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark decides to \nfight\n the \nTen Rings\n \n \n\"I'm sorry, it is me. You asked, what you asked about is me.\"\n\"No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war-zone! You understand that?\"\n\"It's not a piece of equipment. I'm in it, it's a \nsuit\n! It's me!\"\nTony Stark and \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nFaced with the realization of what his company had done behind his back and \nObadiah Stane\n's part in the deception, Stark went back into his workshop and continued building his armors, while watching a \nFBX\n news report on how \nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n and his \nTen Rings\n soldiers were using Stark's own weapons to attack innocent people. Angered by what he was seeing, Stark rose from his seat and used his flight stabilizers to smash the glass doors, realizing they could be used as weapons.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark puts on his \nMark III Armor\n \n \nSeeking to do something good with the technology he had created, Stark weaponized his \nMark III Armor\n and flew to \nAfghanistan\n. Knowing where al-Wazar's men were attacking, Stark headed for \nGulmira\n, the home village of \nHo Yinsen\n. Upon arriving, Stark discovered innocent women and children were being dragged out of their own homes to become slaves for the Ten Rings while the men were being lined up to be executed right in front of their own horrified children.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark \nbattles\n against the \nTen Rings\n \n \nStark \nattacked\n and easily subdued all of the soldiers, using his advanced weapons systems to kill multiple terrorists with single strikes and saving the lives of innocent people. Having found his former captor, \nAbu Bakaar\n, Stark ripped him through a wall and left him for the villagers to gain their own revenge. While Bakaar was being punished, Stark focused his efforts on destroying the Ten Rings entire stockpiles of \nStark Industries\n weapons.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark destroying a \nTen Rings\n tank\n \n \nDuring the battle, Stark was shot out of the sky by one of the Ten Rings' tanks, so Stark responded by shooting his own missile and destroying the tank with ease before he then targeted and destroyed all the \nJericho\n missiles the Ten Rings had. The prolonged battle and massive explosions quickly drew the attention of the \nUnited States Air Force\n and his own friend and company military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel \nJames Rhodes\n who investigated the true cause.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is targeted by two \nF-22 Raptors\n \n \nTwo \nF-22 Raptors\n were ordered by Rhodes to take out the unknown target, with Stark soon finding them directly behind him and attempting to lock on with their weapons, forcing Stark to use his new armor's upgraded flight systems to evade the attacks. As the jets continued targeting him, Stark found they had locked on with a missile so used flairs to destroy the missile before it could hit him, being blown forward by the force of the explosion.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to hide from \nF-22 Raptors\n \n \nHaving managed to use his superior maneuvering systems to hide underneath of the jets itself without being seen, Stark called Rhodes and revealed his true identity to him in an attempt to have the attack called off, with Rhodes being horrified that he had sent some of his own equipment into an active war zone without informing him. While Rhodes tried to stop the attack, Major \nJulius Allen\n, however, order the pilots to take the shot when they could get clear view of him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark successfully saves a pilot's life\n \n \nHowever, while trying to evade the attack, one of the Raptors lost its left wing when it accidentally collided with Stark during the chaos of the battle. The pilot ejected shortly afterwards, but his parachute jammed. Without hesitation, Stark dived down to help the pilot release his parachute before escaping. While heading back towards the \nUnited States of America\n, Stark spoke with Rhodes about what excuse he could then use to explain what had happened.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark's secret is discovered by \nPepper Potts\n \n \nOnce back at \nhis mansion\n, Stark was then helped out of his armor by both \nDum-E and U\n, finding the experience fairly painful as they struggled to find a way to get him back out. During this, Stark was soon discovered by \nPepper Potts\n who had just walked into his workshop to find him still half in his armor. Stark joked that it was still not actually the worst thing that she had ever caught him doing while Potts was horrified to see bullet holes in the armor.\n[\n3\n]\nNext Mission\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fixing the \nMark III Armor\n's damages\n \n \n\"I'm gonna find my weapons and destroy them.\"\n\"Tony you know that I would help you with anything, but I can not help you if you're gonna start all of this again.\"\n\"There is nothing except this. There's no art openings, there's no benefit, there's nothing to sign. There's the next mission.\"\nTony Stark and \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nWith the \nmission\n to defeat the \nTen Rings\n a success, Stark went back to work in tweaking the \nMark III Armor\n in improving its performance. He was soon joined by \nPepper Potts\n whom he requested go into his office in \nStark Industries Headquarters\n to hack into the database in order to find out where his weapons were being sold to the Ten Rings so he could go in using his armor and destroy them. Potts, however, refused to help him on his mission as she feared that going into these active warzones would result in him being killed, but Stark refused to listen.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells \nPepper Potts\n on his new purpose\n \n \nStark noted that for years Potts had stood by his side when he and \nStark Industries\n had been creating the weapons and now, she was planning on leaving once he finally began doing the right thing and protecting the people he had endangered like \nHo Yinsen\n. Stark noted that since \nhis kidnapping\n he had finally learned what he was meant to do with his life. Hearing how sincere Stark was about this mission, Potts took the hard-drive and agreed to help him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is left to die by \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nWhile inside \nhis mansion\n, Stark attempted to answer a call from Potts when he found himself unable to move. To his horror, he found \nObadiah Stane\n looking down on him while using a \nSonic Taser\n. Stane confessed that he had arranged Stark's kidnapping while he ripped out the \nArc Reactor\n from Stark's chest, causing him to go into cardiac arrest. Stane mocked Stark by comparing him to \nhis father\n while promising to kill Potts before walking away.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is given back his original \nArc Reactor\n \n \nHaving regained some control of his body, Stark desperately tried to make it to his workshop to regain his original \nMark I\n Arc Reactor to save his life. However, Stark collapsed inches away from it and was unable to move and minutes from death. But to save his life, Stark was aided by \nDum-E and U\n who had managed to hand Stark the Arc Reactor just in time. Stark was then found by \nJames Rhodes\n who he explained the situation to while being helped back up.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to \nconfront\n \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nHaving been told Potts had recruited \nPhil Coulson\n and an entire team of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agents to arrest Stane, Stark warned it would not be enough as Stane had his own \narmored suit\n. To combat this, Stark put his suit on and prepared to \nbattle\n Stane. While Rhodes admired the armor which he called the coolest thing he had ever seen, Stark told him to keep the skies clear from the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n while he then flew out of his mansion.\n[\n3\n]\nDuel of Los Angeles\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark \nfights\n against \nObadiah Stane\n \n \n\"You would've made \nyour father\n proud.\"\n\"It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!\"\n\"How ironic, Tony! Trying to free the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever.\"\n\nIron Monger\n and \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nStark flew straight to the \nStark Industries Headquarters\n where he discovered \nObadiah Stane\n was attempting to execute \nPepper Potts\n, so he charged down and knocked Stane aside, crashing into the motorway and then through a \nRoxxon Corporation\n truck. Stane responded by picking up an Audi Q7 holding a family and attempting to throw it at Stark, who put all his suit's power into the \nArc Reactor\n to knock Stane back. Having just caught the Q7 and put it down, Stark was briefly run over by the family who were terrified by the experience.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark hovers just above \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nAs Stark recovered, Stane struck again, hitting him with a passing motorcycle and smashing him into a nearby bus. While he was striking him, Stane still continued to mock Stark by claiming that he had built \nStark Industries\n up from nothing back when \nHoward Stark\n had been \nkilled\n. Stane then fired a missile at the bus, as Stark was consumed inside the fireball but was still protected by his suit, despite being launched high into the air.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is chased down by \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nWhile Stark hovered in the air, Stane complimented him on his upgrades before noting that \nhis armor\n had upgrades of its own before flying into the air to then chase Stark down. As they considered what to do, \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n had warned that his \nMark III Armor\n would not survive much longer while Stark decided to fly straight upwards, believing that Stane had not done enough tests on his own armor in order to solve all of its own design issues.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark knocks \nObadiah Stane\n out of the sky\n \n \nAs they soared higher and higher above \nLos Angeles\n, Stark soon found that the superior power of Stane's suit allowed him to quickly catch up with him. However, once Stane had managed to grab hold of Stark, claiming that his own armor was more advanced in every way, Stark revealed to him that he had not solved the icing issue his \nMark II Armor\n had encountered, causing Stane's suit to lose power and then proceeded to fall out of the sky.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is attacked by \nObadiah Stane\n again\n \n \nLosing his power in his own suit, Stark quickly returned to Stark Industries Headquarters where he attempted to get out of the suit, only to be immediately confronted by Stane yet again. Without one of the gauntlets, Stark found himself at a disadvantage as Stane got him in a bear hug and attempted to crush the suit with Stark still inside, until Stark managed to deploy his flares to briefly blind Stane, allowing him to get away for a moment.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark hides from \nObadiah Stane\n \n \nWhile hiding from Stane, Stark told Potts that all his current attempts to defeat Stane were not working so he decided to make a new plan. Stark ordered Potts to overload the main Arc Reactor inside the building and blast the roof with energy in an attempt to defeat Stane. While Potts made her way back into the building, Stark also told her to wait until he had gotten himself clear, promising to buy her some time by fighting Stane.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark damages \nObadiah Stane\n's \narmor\n \n \nStark proceeded to jump onto Stane's back and ripped out important pieces of the armor, taking out his targeting system and effectively blinding Stane. However, Stane soon managed to rip Stark off his back and then threw him across the rooftop, taking off his own helmet as a result. Stark was then left almost defenseless with barely any power left in his suit to fight back against Stane, who opened up his armor and revealed himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark blocks \nObadiah Stane\n's gunshots\n \n \nWhile he crushed Stark's helmet, Stane began mocking Stark by claiming he had finally made his father proud before shooting at him, with Stark managed to block with his gauntlet before the glass floor underneath him was destroyed. While Stark held on, Potts told him to get off the roof. Stane noted that by trying to rid Stark Industries of weapons, Stark had inadvertently created the greatest one ever which Stane would then use to finally kill him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark nearly dies after the \nbattle\n \n \nWhile Stane struggled to aim his missiles at him, Stark ordered Potts to overload the Arc Reactor, which caused a burst of electricity which blasted Stark out of the way while frying the Stane's armor, also killing Stane inside. Stane then fell inside the Arc Reactor, causing a massive explosion while Stark fell unconscious from the ordeal. Stark almost died from the lack of power to his Arc Reactor, but \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n managed to keep him alive long enough to be rescued.\n[\n3\n]\nI Am Iron Man\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to make a public statement\n \n \n\"I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.\"\n\"Just stick to the cards, man.\"\n\"Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is I am Iron Man.\"\nTony Stark and \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nIn the wake of the \nDuel of Los Angeles\n as well as his own near-death experience, Stark was aided by \nJames Rhodes\n who tried to get Stark into an ambulance to see if he had any internal injuries. However, the ambulance was a fake one sent by \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n to retrieve him. Now that they could finally get to talk to Stark, \nPhil Coulson\n talked to him after they had dropped him off at a small theater. Coulson viewed Stark's fighting strategy from his fight with \nObadiah Stane\n on a projector screen. He told him he needed to become a real fighter and that he would be trained by skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.\n[\n23\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells the entire world he is Iron Man\n \n \nThe next morning, news had spread of Stark's new alter ego, dubbed \"Iron Man\" by the press. Stark then held a press conference where Agent Coulson gave him a detailed fabricated cover story about his and Stane's whereabouts and advised him to state that Iron Man was his personal bodyguard. However, during the course of the conference, in a moment of self-clarity, Stark instead announced to the public that he himself was indeed Iron Man.\n[\n3\n]\nMeeting Nick Fury\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is introduced to Director \nNick Fury\n \n \n\"You think you're the only superhero in the world?

He revealed himself as \nNick Fury\n, Director of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, and assured him that he was not the only 'superhero' in the world, intending to discuss the \nAvengers Initiative\n with Stark.\n[\n3\n]\n However, Stark, uninterested in having the government offering him opportunities, ordered Fury out of the house.\n[\n24\n]\nArmored Adventures\n[\n]\nTesting his Armor\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tests the \nMark III armor\n \n \nStark then returned to his workshop and continued developing the \nMark III Iron Man armor\n. First, he fully assembled his armor. He then tested flight controls by maintaining a consistent height. He then tested his directional controls and weapons targeting, both of which were successful.\n[\n25\n]\nStark reached a desert area at one point while wearing the \nMark III Iron Man armor\n and was approached by a series of mechanized assault vehicles. He destroyed each vehicle.\n[\n26\n]\nAerial Assault Training\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark participates in a training program\n \n \n\"How about something a little more challenging?\"\n\"Targets adopting evasive maneuvers.\"\nIron Man and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nStark had \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n program several training exercises for him, and one morning donned the \nIron Man armor\n to go through them. J.A.R.V.I.S. recommended that Stark keep himself steady, which Stark agreed to. Stark had J.A.R.V.I.S. begin with drones activating to work as target practice. Stark took down both drones and received a compliment from J.A.R.V.I.S. Stark destroyed several more drones, so J.A.R.V.I.S. began deploying armored drones which Stark would need to use his repulsors to destroy. Stark requested a bigger challenge, so J.A.R.V.I.S. had the drones employ evasive maneuvers, but Stark still managed to destroy them. Stark asked for real-world conditions, prompting J.A.R.V.I.S. make the drones hostile and capable of launching missiles at Stark. As a final challenge for the exercise, J.A.R.V.I.S. programmed a large airship to fire a missile at Stark, who destroyed the airship. J.A.R.V.I.S. told Stark that he would arm the warheads for the next round, exciting Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark practices his unibeam\n \n \nStark entered the next training exercise and started working on charging and using his unibeam while in flight. J.A.R.V.I.S. introduced \"Commander\" drones that could only be destroyed by the unibeam. He destroyed a commander drone and celebrated completing the exercise. Stark entered the next exercise and began fighting. Stark then saw a much larger ship pass over him and fly away. He resumed fighting and flew toward the large ship, completing the challenge.\n[\n27\n]\nSmartbomb\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tests his \nSmartbomb\n \n \n\"Let's break out one of the new toys, J.A.R.V.I.S.\"\n\"Smartbomb now online, sir.\"\nTony Stark and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nStark asked \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to incorporate one of the newer features into the training, so J.A.R.V.I.S. activated Stark's \nSmartbomb\n. Stark fought through the drones and charged the Smartbomb, releasing it as the large ship from the previous exercise appeared, destroying the drones released by the ship. He continued to the next exercise, fighting trough the drones and another large ship like the one from the previous exercise. He repeated this and then told J.A.R.V.I.S. he wanted to spare his paint job, prompting J.A.R.V.I.S. to activate the armor's shields. The ship appeared again and released an Omega Drone that Stark destroyed.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fights using his enhanced shields\n \n \nStark went through two more training exercises successfully. J.A.R.V.I.S. enhanced Stark's shields, allowing them to recharge faster, which excited Stark. He practiced with the shields and entered the next part of the exercise, in which he was confronted by a part of the large ship that had been dropping off drones, which the exercise called a Gomeran Carrier. The carrier deployed more drones, but Stark destroyed them and the Carrier. Stark stated that he was impressed with himself and celebrated. Stark's shields were again enhanced as he entered the final training exercise, which ended with Stark being confronted by the large ship itself. Stark blasted the outside and made his way into the ship and flew out of it as the ship crashed. Stark then celebrated, having completed all of the exercises.\n[\n27\n]\nDealing with a Public Identity\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man faces \nSomalian\n pirates\n \n \n\"Back already?

Stark also helped General \nThaddeus Ross\n in saving the pilot of the \nAerodynamic Marvel\n that crashed in the \nCongo\n. Senator \nStern\n also expressed his concerns of the Iron Man suit as a topic in national security.\n[\n28\n]\n When \nNick Fury\n sent a team of \nUnited States Navy SEALs\n to board a ship controlled by the Ten Rings in the port of \nAden\n, Iron Man suddenly appeared and attacked the terrorists.

Later, back in his house, Stark talked with \nPepper Potts\n about his latest action.\n[\n29\n]\nDating Lina\n[\n]\nTrying to have a serious relationship after the revelation that he is Iron Man, Stark started a relationship with \nLina\n, a beautiful girl.

You'll have to write it down somewhere else, or enter it into my phone, or\"\n\"or we could wait until fate brings us back together.\"\nTony Stark and \nEvetta Gorani\n[src]\nWhen Stark went to \nGermany\n to a meeting with the representatives of \nGorani Insurance\n, a company that was financially backing most of his foreign factories, to talk about the new rates, he encountered a roadblock in the \nGerman autobahns\n. The policemen then told him that some thieves had stolen paintings worth over 100 million dollars. Later, he encountered a girl with a small problem  a flat car tire. He helped her to change the tire but when he asked her for her phone number, she said he would have to wait until fate brought them back together.\nAfter the girl left, Stark saw a vehicle in the forest that matched the description of the van that the thieves used in their robbery. He decided to check and saw the whole gang. Though he did not bring his entire \nIron Man Armor\n, he had the left glove and used it to defeat and capture all of the thieves.Stark then called the police, who arrested the criminals, and then he took the paintings back to the museum, but did not take any reward for returning the paintings. He then rushed to arrive on time to his meeting.\nLater, when he arrived at his postponed meeting, he was reunited with the girl he met in the autobahns, and discovered that she was \nEvetta Gorani\n, the vice president of Gorani Insurance, who was eventually going to take the mantle of president from her father, \nMichael\n. Michael told Stark that the museum that owned the stolen paintings was insured by Gorani Insurance. When he asked Evetta again for her phone number, she said they would \"negotiate\" after the meeting.\n[\n34\n]\nPerson of the Year\n[\n]\nAs Iron Man, Stark performed numerous acts of heroism around the world, including savingthe crew of a \nRussian\n submarine, pulling a woman out of a burning building, and saving12 miners from a hematite mine in Tianjin, \nChina\n.These acts spread like wildfire, increasing the amount of publicity he received and making him the focus of countless newspaper articles. Many began crediting him as the manwho \"[stabilized] East-West relations\" while\nTime magazine\nfeatured him as their \"Person of the Year.\"\n[\n12\n]\nFacing Health Problems\n[\n]\nPalladium Poisoning\n[\n]\n\"It appears that the continued use of the \nIron Man suit\n is accelerating your condition.

You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the \ndevice\n that's keeping you alive is also killing you.\"\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nUnfortunately, Stark's own life was not as good as it appeared, as he was facing a double threat. The first was in the form of his own heart: the \nArc Reactor\n \npalladium\n core was poisoning Stark due to overuse of the \nIron Man Armor\n. To maintain appearances, he was forced to drink homemade medicine to counteract the symptoms. Meanwhile, Stark was also aware that the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n were constantly looking to confiscate all his technology.\n[\n12\n]\nStarting the Stark Expo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man enters the \nStark Expo\n conference\n \n \n\"I'm not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.

Treating the crowd to the \nIronette Dancers\n and a speech in which he boasted about giving the world its longest running period of uninterrupted peace, Stark left the stage with a video of his father playing.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHappy Hogan\n leave the \nExpo\n \n \nStark then left the Expo with \nHappy Hogan\n helping to keep the \npress\n at bay, signing autographs and meeting \nLarry Ellison\n and \nLarry King\n on their way out before he was then confronted by a beautiful \nU.S. Marshal\n who was waiting beside his car. The Marshal then informed Stark and Hogan that he was now required to attend a congressional meeting in \nWashington, D.C.\n the very next day in order to discuss the future of his work as the well-known superhero Iron Man.\n[\n12\n]\nMeeting with Senator Stern\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nPepper Potts\n at the hearing\n \n \n\"I am Iron Man.

Stark refused, believing it was not in the best interest of the American people for the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n to possess it since they would use it as a weapon that could very well be used against America if other various countries were able to recreate the \nArc Reactor\n technology.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark humiliates \nStern\n and \nJustin Hammer\n \n \nSenator Stern tried to turn Lt. Colonel \nJames Rhodes\n against Stark in an effort to force his decision. Competitor \nJustin Hammer\n tried to plead his case on the matter; Stark took this opportunity to embarrass both Hammer and Stern with a collection of footage of \nHammer Industries\n and other entities around the world attempting to \nrecreate the technology\n. Stark arrogantly stated that it would be years before anyone would be able to successfully recreate his tech and he had \"privatized\" world peace.\n[\n12\n]\nMaking Pepper Potts CEO\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark returns to \nhis Malibu mansion\n \n \n\"I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of \nStark Industries\n effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I've actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realized it's you. It's always been you.\"\nTony Stark to \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nReturning to \nhis mansion\n, Stark was greeted by \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n who updated him on the fallout from his meeting with Senator \nStern\n. While Stark listened to the news, he pulled out his \nArc Reactor\n and examined the damaged \npalladium\n core which was slowly killing him, with J.A.R.V.I.S. noting that a replacement had not yet been found that could power his many \nIron Man Armors\n and also still keep him alive.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark appoints \nPepper Potts\n as CEO\n \n \nUncertain of his chances of survival, Stark decided to appoint his former personal assistant \nPepper Potts\n into the role he no longer was interested in, the CEO of \nStark Industries\n, while he was still the owner of the company, but being only a figurehead. When Potts arrived in his workshop, she and Stark had an argument about his own lack of interest in his company and their resources ever since becoming Iron Man, at which point Stark informed her that he had decided to promote her. Although Potts did not at first believe that he was being serious with this idea, Stark had \nDum-E\n deliver some champagne to them as he confirmed that this would be happening and she was the perfect person to take over the job from him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nHappy Hogan\n box together\n \n \nWhile doing some boxing training with \nHappy Hogan\n, during which he used dirty boxing techniques to gain the upper hand, Stark saw the arrival of Potts and a notary from the company, \"Natalie Rushman\", who was actually \nNatasha Romanoff\n, an Agent of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n Although Hogan hit Stark around the head, he proceeded to kick him away and beat him into surrendering before inviting Romanoff into the ring. Stark looked into Romanoff's eyes before inviting Hogan to train with her instead.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark looks at \n\"Natalie Rushman\"\n \n \nStark then sat down with Potts to discuss \"Rushman,\" with him bringing up her \"history files\" and noting that she even spoke \nLatin\n and had once been a lingerie model. While they were speaking, Stark and Potts witnessed Romanoff using a leg move to pin Hogan to the floor, before she exited the ring and asked Stark to sign the paperwork handing Stark Industries over to Potts. Once Romanoff was gone, Stark told Potts that he needed her as his new assistant.\n[\n12\n]\nMonaco Grand Prix\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark meets \nJustin Hammer\n \n \n\"Well, what's the use of having and owning a race car if you don't drive it?\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nJust before travelling to \nMonaco\n with \nPepper Potts\n and \nHappy Hogan\n, Stark finished work on his \nMark V Armor\n. There, Stark and Potts encountered \nJustin Hammer\n, who smugly tried to show off that he was being interviewed by \nChristine Everhart\n for an upcoming piece with \nVanity Fair\n; Stark quickly made it clear of his own romantic history with Everhart and noted that \nHammer Industries\n had lost their contract with the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n due to Hammer's embarrassing performance at the senate committee hearing.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark questions his difficult life choices\n \n \nTaking some time away from Hammer, Stark excused himself to check his blood toxicity level in the bathroom. He saw that the \nArc Reactor\n's poisoning of his body due to the levels of \npalladium\n was now emitting into his skin. Looking up at the mirror and seeing that he likely did not have much time left until he would eventually die from this poisoning, Stark began questioning what he would like to do with these last few months that he likely had left.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark decides to race in \nMonaco Grand Prix\n \n \nGrowing increasingly despondent and thrill-seeking as a direct consequence of what he believed to be his impending death, Stark decided to take the \nStark Industries\n car intended for the track and race it at the \nMonaco Grand Prix\n. As he stepped into the car, with all the cameras now facing him, Stark gave a look which he knew would be viewed by Hammer, much to his annoyance as Stark would once again be taking the spotlight away from him.\n[\n12\n]\nDuel of Monaco\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark's car is destroyed by \nIvan Vanko\n \n \n\"Were you heading for me or \nhim\n?\"\n\"I was trying to scare him!\"\n\"Because I can't tell! Better security! I was attacked!\"\nTony Stark and \nHappy Hogan\n[src]\nAs Stark drove around the track, \nIvan Vanko\n, who had successfully constructed an \nArc Reactor\n of his own, along with \nwhip-like energy weapons\n, attacked him, using the whips to cut off the front of his car and cause it to crash along with several other race cars. Stark had managed to crawl out of the car before it could be sliced in half. Despite his best efforts to fight back, Vanko's armored weapons managed to get the better of Stark, who was defenseless.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark considers how to escape\n \n \nAs Vanko prepared to rip Stark apart, he was forced to use his own wits and cunning to escape the deadly whips Vanko was using. Managing to get behind Vanko, Stark struck him on the back of the head with a car door, but Vanko proved to be unaffected, forcing Stark to dodge out of the way of his attacks. He then tricked Vanko into striking the whips onto gasoline, causing an explosion which separated the pair from each other for a brief time.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is saved by \nHappy Hogan\n's arrival\n \n \nWith Vanko proving himself too strong to be beaten without his armor, Stark seemed to be running out of options as he was backed into a corner. However, he received aid with the sudden arrival of both \nPepper Potts\n and \nHappy Hogan\n, who had driven their own car into the race track and successfully managed to crash it into Vanko, pinning him against the wall and briefly knocking him out cold. Stark then prepared to quickly make his escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man dons his \nMark V Armor\n \n \nHowever, while Stark moaned about \nStark Industries\n' seeming lack of security at the event, Vanko continued to fight despite still being pinned to the wall and began ripping Hogan's car apart with furious strikes from his electric whips. This forced the terrified Potts to then hand Stark his \nportable briefcase armor\n, allowing him to don the Mark V Armor ready to do battle against his would-be assassin in the middle of the track, with Iron Man having the upper hand.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man being electrocuted by \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nUsing his new suit, Iron Man attempted to subdue Vanko by firing his repulsor rays at his attacker, but Vanko was able to block those blows with his own armor before using his whips to strangle Iron Man. Vanko flung him across the racetrack into Hogan's car and then back the other way, tightening the whips around Iron Man's neck and shocking him with volts of electricity, which were slowly destroying the suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man successfully defeats \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nNot allowing himself to be defeated, Iron Man managed to build up his own strength and began wrapping the whips around himself in order to get closer towards Vanko. Once he was close enough, Iron Man punched Vanko in the face a few times before ripping the Arc Reactor out of his chest and crushing it. As Vanko was being dragged away by the police, he laughingly claimed that Iron Man had now lost while Iron Man studied Vanko's Arc Reactor, crushing it in shock.\n[\n12\n]\nMeeting with Ivan Vanko\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark visits \nIvan Vanko\n's prison cell\n \n \n\"Where will you be watching the world consume me from? Oh, that's right, a prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap.\"\n\"Hey, Tony. Before you go, \npalladium\n in the chest, painful way to die.\"\nTony Stark and \nIvan Vanko\n[src]\nAfterward, Stark decided to pay a visit to \nIvan Vanko\n personally while he was being held in \nBatiment B3\n, \nFrance\n to learn how he had acquired the \nArc Reactor\n technology, being led there by \nLemieux\n. Once they were alone, Stark commented on \nVanko's armor\n and even suggested ways that he could improve it, thinking that he would never actually get a chance to. Stark wondered why Vanko would use the technology to kill him rather than for more tangible personal gain.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nIvan Vanko\n speak in private\n \n \nVanko revealed that he was the son of \nAnton Vanko\n, who had collaborated with \nHoward Stark\n on the first Arc Reactor but was deported back to the \nSoviet Union\n and died in poverty. Vanko blamed the Stark family for his family's fate, and sought revenge, warning that Stark would die now that he proved Iron Man was not invincible. Stark retorted that Vanko would still be in prison either way. As he left, Vanko mentioned Stark's current blood poisoning, taunting that it was a terrible way to die.\n[\n12\n]\nIvan Vanko's Attack Aftermath\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark speaks to \nPepper Potts\n on his \njet\n \n \n\"You said no one else would possess this technology for twenty years. Well, guess what? \nSomebody else\n had it yesterday. It's not theoretical anymore.\"\n\nJames Rhodes\n to Tony Stark\n[src]\nDespite \nIvan Vanko\n having been imprisoned for his crimes, the response to another man using the \nArc Reactor\n technology was immediate, with many people, including Senator \nStern\n, commenting on Stark's failure. While on his \nprivate jet\n returning to the \nUnited States\n, Stark made breakfast for \nPepper Potts\n as they discussed the aftermath of the attack. Stark even suggested that he quit being Iron Man from now on and almost confessed to Potts of his current state, but backed out.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is berated by \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nStark returned to \nhis mansion\n where he and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n continued searching for a new \nArc Reactor\n power source while looking over records of \nIvan Vanko\n and his father, \nAnton Vanko\n. Stark learned Anton had worked for \nStark Industries\n in the \n1960s\n before being deported under the orders of \nHoward Stark\n whilst Vanko was a \nSoviet\n physicist arrested for illegal weapons dealing. He was later visited by \nJames Rhodes\n, who came to warn Stark about the military's wish to take his suits. However, he recognized Stark's unwell state and assisted him by changing the Arc Reactor's \npalladium\n core. Rhodes then tried to convince Stark that he did not have to go through his journey alone but Stark remained skeptical.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shares a drink with \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \nThe next night, feeling more depressed about his future as the poisoning neared its peak, Stark considered canceling his birthday party after learning he had only a week left to live. He was then visited by \nNatasha Romanoff\n, undercover as \"Natalie Rushman,\" who prepared Stark a drink and gave him a choice of watches to wear. He posed these questions to Romanoff, asking what she would do on her final birthday. Romanoff replied that she would do whatever she wanted, with whomever she wanted to do it with.\n[\n12\n]\n40th Birthday Party\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark openly flirts with \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \n\"You think you got what it takes to wear \nthat suit\n?\"\n\"We don't have to do this, Tony.\"\n\"You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot!\"\nIron Man and \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nStark decided to attend what could very well be his last ever birthday party and quickly got himself very drunk, partying with the many guests who had come to celebrate. He invited \nNatasha Romanoff\n, still known to Stark as \"Natalie Rushman,\" to wear one of his gauntlets and fire it at an ice sculpture, taking great pleasure in the destruction before joining the other attendees. Stark then drank even more alcohol shots to become further intoxicated and even harder to keep in control.\n[\n36\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man gets drunk at his birthday party\n \n \nWhile wearing the \nMark IV Iron Man Armor\n and indulging in many dangerous activities, such as using his repulsor blasts to destroy a watermelon, Iron Man was watched by \nPepper Potts\n who attempted to make him stop, being advised by \nJames Rhodes\n that this was a terrible time to be acting so reckless. Despite Potts taking the microphone away from Iron Man and trying to tell the guests that it was time to go home, Iron Man would not listen to reason and instead insisted that his party keep going as he continued to misuse his suit to entertain his drunk guests within \nhis mansion\n, much to Potts' and Rhodes' dismay as they looked on in concern.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man faces down \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nIn the end, Iron Man's actions became more and more dangerous and foolish, forcing his friend, Rhodes, to intervene. Rhodes donned the \nMark II Iron Man Armor\n and ordered the guests out of the room before demanding that Iron Man get out of the suit. Iron Man ignored him and instead requested that \nAdam Goldstein\n put on a good song for the incoming fight. The pair clashed as they flew through room to room, using whatever weapons they could find to try and subdue the other, including throwing heavy weights at each other before Rhodes managed to throw Iron Man into his upstairs bedroom.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man threatens to shoot \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nEventually, after almost destroying the entire mansion in the \nresulting fight\n, Iron Man managed to subdue Rhodes by smashing his head down on the kitchen counter, before roaring at the onlookers to force them to flee the scene. After Rhodes recovered and knocked him against the fireplace, Iron Man dared his friend to take his shot as they both fired their repulsors at each other, causing a massive explosion. With Iron Man weakened the fight, he could only look on while Rhodes flew away to deliver the armor to the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n.\n[\n12\n]\nRediscovering the Element\n[\n]\nNick Fury's Help\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is greeted by Director \nNick Fury\n \n \n\"That \nthing\n in your chest is based on unfinished technology.\"\n\"No, it was finished.

While he was relaxing in the morning sun, \nNick Fury\n, Director of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, approached Iron Man and ordered him to come inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man talks with Director \nNick Fury\n \n \nTaking a seat inside, Iron Man once again informed Fury that he was not interested in joining the \nAvengers\n before rudely asking if he should look at Fury's eye or patch. Changing the subject, Fury then revealed to Iron Man that \"Natalie Rushman\" was in fact undercover Agent \nNatasha Romanoff\n in her Black Widow outfit, who Iron Man tried and failed to fire from \nStark Industries\n. As he and Fury continued their conversation, Black Widow injected Iron Man with \nlithium dioxide\n to slow down the poisoning in his veins caused by his \nArc Reactor\n. Fury reassured Iron Man that somewhere there was a cure and he simply had not discovered it yet, despite Iron Man insisting that he had already looked everywhere and found nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nNick Fury\n discuss \nHoward Stark\n \n \nReturning to \nStark's mansion\n, they discussed the history of \nAnton Vanko\n who had been working with \nHoward Stark\n in creating the Arc Reactor before he was deported for selling secrets on the black market, where he then raised his son, \nIvan Vanko\n, in \nSiberia\n. Before he departed, Fury revealed that Howard was one of the founders of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and left a skeptical Stark to go through his father's belongings to find the cure, with Agent \nPhil Coulson\n watching over him.\n[\n12\n]\nResearching His Family\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark watches \nhis father\n's various film reels\n \n \n\"Dead for almost twenty years, still taking me to school.\"\n\"The proposed \nelement\n should serve as a viable replacement for \npalladium\n.\"\n\"Thanks, \nDad\n.\"\nTony Stark and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nNick Fury\n gave Stark some of \nhis father\n's old material to aid in finding a cure for the \npalladium\n poisoning. Stark found several items, including Howard's notebook with drawings of a \"\nhypercube\n\" and two \nCaptain America\n comic books\n. He remained dismissive and bitter over these past relics until watching an old tape of his father, in which Stark discovered a hidden message where Howard told him that he was proud of his son and viewed Stark as his greatest creation.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark has a meeting with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nStark then drove to the \nStark Industries Headquarters\n, buying some strawberries along the way and met with \nPepper Potts\n, though \nBambi Arbogast\n tried to inform him she was too busy to talk. Once Stark got her attention, he attempted to apologize in his own way, which Potts struggled to believe and insisted she needed to focus on \nStark Industries\n' future. They were interrupted by \nHappy Hogan\n and \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who were both now working only for Potts.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark spots a hidden message in a diorama\n \n \nAs Potts and Hogan left the office, Stark spoke with Romanoff and questioned how she could keep this lie going and she subtly insulted him before leaving. Stark prepared to leave the office, dumping the strawberries into the bin, but then he noticed the diorama of the \n1974\n \nStark Expo\n, which he had seen in his father's film reels. Stark disassembled the model and drove it back to his mansion for further study.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finally discovers the \nsecret element\n \n \nPutting the model on his desk, Stark ordered \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to make a scan of the model, removing all the trees and buildings from the holographic image so he could focus just on the model itself. As J.A.R.V.I.S. questioned what Stark's plan was, he explained that he believed he had found a hidden message. Eventually, Stark realized that the new element was hidden inside the Expo globe in the center and thanked his father for gifting him with it as it would soon save his life.\n[\n12\n]\nA New Element\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says goodbye to \nPhil Coulson\n \n \n\"That was easy.\"\n\"Congratulations, sir. You have created a \nnew element\n. Sir, the \nReactor\n has accepted the modified core.\"\nTony Stark and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nAs Stark put the final pieces together to begin his experiment, he was greeted by \nPhil Coulson\n, who asked where he had been before discovering a prototype for \nCaptain America's Shield\n which Stark took and used to straighten some of his machinery with Coulson's assistance. Coulson then informed Stark that he was leaving to head to \nNew Mexico\n to investigate a \nmysterious object\n that had been found there.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark begins creating the \nnew element\n \n \nWith the aid of his A.I. \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n, Stark put his experiment into action, assembling a large \nlaser\n in the center of his workshop in \nhis mansion\n. Stark pushed the laser into position, struggling to hold it in place as it shot through the walls while he aimed it at its target. As the laser hit the newly designed \nArc Reactor\n Stark had made, it finally synthesized the \nnew element\n. As Stark picked up his creation and studied it, J.A.R.V.I.S. confirmed that the new element would indeed be a suitable replacement for \npalladium\n and be able to keep him alive while powering his \nIron Man Armors\n for the foreseeable future. Stark then continued upgrading the Reactor and his next suit.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns that \nIvan Vanko\n is still alive\n \n \nAfterwards while Stark continued his work on his new suit, he received a call which turned out to come from \nIvan Vanko\n, despite having last been heard dying in a prison explosion, revealing he was still alive and bent on revenge. While Stark attempted to trace the call and locate the dangerous terrorist, Vanko promised that he would soon have his revenge for what \nHoward Stark\n had done to his father \nAnton Vanko\n before hanging up the call.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark puts on his newly built \nArc Reactor\n \n \nAs Vanko had warned that he had taken Stark's scientific advice and improved \nhis own armor\n to be ready for their next battle, Stark donned the \nMark VI Iron Man Armor\n. Despite J.A.R.V.I.S.' objections, Stark wore his new Arc Reactor and commented on how it felt putting it on for the first time, noting he got a distinct taste of both coconut and metal. Remembering \nJustin Hammer\n's new presentation for the military at the \nStark Expo\n, Stark suited up and flew off to then confront Vanko and stop his evil plans.\n[\n12\n]\nBattle at Stark Expo\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man arrives to confront \nJustin Hammer\n \n \n\"Rhodey, you still locked on?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We're about to get wet on this ride.\"\nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n[src]\nAt the \nStark Expo\n, Iron Man arrived to confront \nJustin Hammer\n, who was busy unveiling his \nHammer Drones\n, captained by \nJames Rhodes\n in a heavily weaponized \narmored suit\n, which was a modified version of the \nMark II Iron Man Armor\n. While trying to keep the audience calm, Iron Man demanded to know where \nIvan Vanko\n was, although Hammer denied all knowledge of him and tried to play off the incident to the audience. Iron Man then approached Rhodes, warning him that Vanko was still alive.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to control \nWar Machine\n \n \nSuddenly, Vanko seized control of both the Drones and Rhodes' armor, directing them all to attack Iron Man, who then flew across the Expo in a desperate attempt to lose his attackers and cause them all to crash, while ordering \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to regain control of Rhodes. During the \nbattle\n, Iron Man did all he could to save the hundreds of attendees fleeing during the chaos,\n[\n12\n]\n including \nPeter Parker\n, who was mistaken for him by a Drone for wearing an Iron Man mask.\n[\n37\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man outruns the \nHammer Drones\n \n \nQuickly running out of options as Rhodes continued to fire upon him using \nHammer Industries\n weapons, Iron Man tried his best to take out the Drones, flying them all away from the civilians before leading them straight into the \nUnisphere\n. Using the his \nMark VI Armor\n's superior maneuvering abilities, Iron Man had managed to escape and cause the bulkier Hammer Drones to crash into the globe and explode all together in a massive fireball.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man blocks \nWar Machine\n's attacks\n \n \nHowever, before Iron Man could relax, he was knocked out of the sky and into an \nOracle Corporation\n dome by Rhodes, who was still being controlled by Vanko. Iron Man attempted to block Rhodes' attacks, holding his mini gun at bay until \nBlack Widow\n successfully overrode Vanko's programming, having broken into the \nHammer Industries Headquarters\n with a little help from \nHappy Hogan\n, despite failing to arrest Vanko.\n[\n12\n]\nShowdown with Ivan Vanko\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man helps \nWar Machine\n getting up\n \n \n\"You have a big gun, you are not the big gun.\"\n\"Tony, don't be jealous.\"\n\"No, it's subtle. All the bells and whistles.\"\n\"Yeah, it's called being a badass.\"\nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n[src]\nIron Man knocked \nJames Rhodes\n back before \nBlack Widow\n confirmed that he was safe at last and in control of his own \narmor\n. She also complimented Iron Man on his \nnew element\n which had now stopped his \npalladium\n poisoning, causing \nPepper Potts\n to confront Iron Man for not telling her he was dying. While Potts had \nJustin Hammer\n arrested, Iron Man helped Rhodes back onto his feet.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n ready to fight\n \n \nKnowing that the remaining \nHammer Drones\n would be coming to their location, both Iron Man and Rhodes then came up with a plan to battle them; however, this only led to an argument between the two friends over who should take the better position in the area, with both of them believing that they had the superior armor and skills. However, before they could make up their minds, the Drones then arrived and surrounded Iron Man and Rhodes; with nowhere to escape to, the pair donned their own helmets and prepared for battle, firing their weapons at the attacking Drones.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fighting against \nHammer Drones\n \n \nAs the \nbattle\n then commenced, Iron Man and Rhodes found that although they could easily defeat each Drone, the numbers began to overwhelm them. While Rhodes used his impressive weaponry provided by \nHammer Industries\n to destroy the attackers, Iron Man used his top-of-the-range \narmor\n to fight back and destroy multiple targets at once, eventually using his lasers to slice all of the remaining Drones in half and finally win the fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n face \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nUpon eliminating the drones, Iron Man and Rhodes were then informed by Black Widow that they had a new enemy coming in, who she warned appeared to be much stronger than all of the previous ones. This was revealed to be \nIvan Vanko\n in his new, more powerful \nsuit of armor\n. Attempting to kill Vanko before the fight could even begin, Rhodes armed the \nEx-Wife Missile\n, only for it to fail and not even dent Vanko's armor, with Iron Man then noting that it was clearly a Hammer Industries weapon due to being useless in battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights against \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nIron Man then engaged in a fierce battle with Vanko, with himself and Rhodes throwing all they had at defeating him or damaging his armor enough to cause him to surrender. However, they both found that not only was Vanko's armor too strong, but he had upgraded his whips to the point they were more dangerous than ever before. The pair soon found themselves overpowered by Vanko's improved technology and weapons.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man finds a way to defeat \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nVanko soon managed to gain the upper hand in the battle when he succeeded in wrapping his electrified whips around Iron Man and Rhodes' throats and slowly tightened them, hoping to break their necks. With no other choice, Iron Man called on Rhodes to use the technique they discovered during the \nduel at his mansion\n and fired their own repulsor rays at each other, triggering an explosion in front of Vanko and knocking them all back.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man stands over \nIvan Vanko\n \n \nRecovering from the shockwave and getting back onto their feet, Iron Man and Rhodes found Vanko lying on the battlefield, with not only his Mark II Armor but his own body damaged beyond repair. Too injured to continue the fight, Vanko claimed that Stark had in fact lost this fight before he ignited his and all of the Hammer Drones' self-destruct bombs, including one in his own armor. Knowing that these Drones were littered across \nStark Expo\n since he had shot many of them out of the sky, Iron Man quickly flew to rescue anyone remaining there before the Drones exploded and caused major casualties.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man shares a kiss with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nIron Man raced to save Potts amid the series of explosions, pulling her away just in time. Seeing the chaos that he brought with him, Potts quit her position as CEO of \nStark Industries\n, but Iron Man only teased her about the concept of leaving him before finally confessing how important she was to him, and the couple then kissed each other. Rhodes then revealed he was on the roof too before departing with his armor without serious objection from Iron Man, leaving them where he refused to accept Potts' resignation.\n[\n12\n]\nMaking the New War Machine Armor\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nRhodes\n and Stark with the new armor.\n \n \n\"Nevertheless, you, James Rhodes, are never wearing the \nMark II armor\n againbecause I made \nthis\n for you instead.\"\n\nTony Stark\n[src]\nSome time later, Stark retrieved the \nWar Machine armor\n and stripped it of the \nHammer Industries\n weapons and turned it back into the \nMark II\n. When \nJames Rhodes\n arrived, Stark informed him he would never wear that armor again because he made him a \nnew one\n with better technology and weaponry.\n[\n38\n]\nNot a Suitable Candidate\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nNick Fury\n discuss the \nInitiative\n \n \n\"How can you approve me but not approve me?

A couple of hours later in exchange, Stark got his wish and took the job as consultant. He took great pleasure in Senator Stern's annoyance at being forced to give him a new medal, smiling for the pictures and offering a peace sign to the crowd of onlookers.\n[\n12\n]\nConsultant for S.H.I.E.L.D.\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark searches for General \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \n\"The smell of stale beer and defeat.

The task was then completed with Ross refusing to release Blonsky from his custody out of pure spite.\n[\n39\n]\nStark eventually went back to work on improving his armor. He looked back at his previous failures and noted what needed to be improved for his \nMark VII armor\n. Eventually, \nPepper Potts\n gifted him \nColantotte Bracelets\n which were magnetic bracelets. He decided to work them into his armor so he can quickly have his armor come to him if needed.\n[\n15\n]\nPublic Superhero\n[\n]\nIn \nJuly 2011\n, Stark was interviewed by \nWHiH World News\n about his dual identity as Iron Man.\n[\n41\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fights the \nGlider Harness\n \n \nIn early \n2012\n, Stark made a bet against \nGlobal Incorporated\n that he could beat their newly developed \nGlider Harness\n. Stark easily outsmarted them by throwing restraints at their gliders, sending them into a billboard. The owner of the company, \nOmar\n, angrily demanded that he'd pay for the billboard.\n[\n42\n]\nChitauri Invasion\n[\n]\nAvengers Initiation\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man completes his work on \nStark Tower\n \n \n\"You have reached the \nLife-Model Decoy\n of Tony Stark.

Stark was then informed by \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n that Agent \nPhil Coulson\n had arrived and now wished to speak with him, to which he refused and even claimed to be a \nLife-Model Decoy\n, but Coulson still insisted that he needed to speak to Stark urgently and then let himself into the tower, much to Stark's dismay as he blamed Potts for the security breach.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns of \nLoki\n's invasion of \nEarth\n \n \nCoulson informed Stark that the \nAvengers Initiative\n was now active in the wake of the \nDestruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.\n at the hands of \nLoki\n, an \nAsgardian\n who had attacked some \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n Agents, stolen the \nTesseract\n, and took \nErik Selvig\n and \nClint Barton\n as his mind-controlled slaves with the power of his \nScepter\n. Coulson explained that they needed him to come in despite having previously been rejected from the \nAvengers\n, handing Stark holographic screens with information about \nCaptain America\n, \nThor\n, \nHulk\n and Loki for him to study. While Potts and Coulson left the tower, Stark began examining the Tesseract design.\n[\n15\n]\nCapturing Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nCaptain America\n capture \nLoki\n \n \n\"Do not touch me again.\"\n\"Then don't take \nmy stuff\n.\"\n\"You don't know what you're dealing with.\"\n\"\nShakespeare\n in the Park?

Iron Man jetted right in and blasted Loki with his repulsors and stood tall next to Captain America, aiming every weapon he had and forcing Loki to surrender as they took him into custody.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man witnesses \nThor\n kidnapping \nLoki\n \n \nEscorting Loki onto the Quinjet in handcuffs, the team headed back towards the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's \nHelicarrier\n. Iron Man commented on Captain America' fighting skills and subtly mocked his lack of knowledge of modern society since returning from \nWorld War II\n, questioning if he had taken up \nPilates\n. As they were discussing why Loki had surrendered, a sudden thunderstorm had occurred, seemingly unnerving Loki. The Quinjet was then attacked by \nThor\n, the adoptive brother of Loki, who broke in and subdued Iron Man before he could fight back before ripping Loki out from his seat before flying away, leaving Iron Man and Captain America behind.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attacks and confronts \nThor\n \n \nWhile Thor threatened Loki atop a mountain in order to learn exactly who Loki's master is, Iron Man blasted straight into him, hurling him onto the forest floor away from Loki. While Thor got his bearings, Iron Man revealed himself and was warned to not touch Thor again, to which he told him not to take his things, referring to Loki. Thor then informed Iron Man he did not understand what was happening, and Iron Man mockingly claimed that Thor looked like he was in a \nWilliam Shakespeare\n production in the park, telling him that he looked like he was wearing \nhis mother\n's own clothing.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is electrocuted by \nMjlnir\n \n \nThe two began to \nbattle\n as Thor refused to not be allowed to take Loki was to the \nAsgardian Dungeons\n as he struck Iron Man who defended himself. During the fight, Thor summoned lightning to his hammer, \nMjlnir\n, and electrocuted Stark; however, this only succeeded in super-charging Stark's suit. \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n inform him that his suit was at four-hundred percent capacity, allowing him to blast Thor off his feet. When Thor attempted to charge at him, Iron Man charged back and managed to push him straight into a mountain, but Thor continued to fight back and caused them to crash land back in the forest where they then continued fighting each other.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is locked into \nbattle\n against \nThor\n \n \nIron Man's armor took a beating during the battle as Thor easily began to crush one of the gauntlets with just his bare hands. Fearing his arm would be shattered, Iron Man responded by shooting Thor in the face, which merely knocked his head back, before head butting him with his helmet. However, Thor's own \nAsgardian\n strength allowed him to withstand all of Iron Man's blows and be unaffected as they continued their fight with Iron Man using all the advantages of his suit to try and subdue Thor without killing him so that he could then take him and Loki back into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man with \nThor\n and \nCaptain America\n \n \nTheir fight was broken up by Captain America who demanded that they stop fighting and questioned what Thor was doing on \nEarth\n, in which he explained he had come to put an end to Loki's \nschemes\n. Captain America then insisted that Thor prove that he was on their side by putting down his hammer, to which Iron Man noted that was a bad move as Thor loved his hammer, just before he was struck by Mjlnir and knocked through a tree just when Thor attacked Captain America. After Captain America matched Mjlnir with \nhis shield\n, the three managed to calm and Thor got recruited, recapturing Loki and taking him away.\n[\n15\n]\nMeeting the Avengers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark arrives on board the \nHelicarrier\n \n \n\"\nThat\n's the guy \nmy dad\n never shut up about?

Stark then joined the group, complimenting \nThor\n on his fighting skills and pointing out an \nAgent playing Galaga\n before noting that Loki needed \nIridium\n in order to control the \nTesseract\n's power. As Stark explained why Loki needed \nErik Selvig\n and \nClint Barton\n, he was questioned about his newfound expertise by \nMaria Hill\n and revealed that he had done his research the night before, noting that all Loki needed was a \npower source\n to control the Tesseract.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is introduced to Doctor \nBruce Banner\n \n \nStark was introduced to \nBruce Banner\n who understood all of his own theories, delighting Stark who then complimented Banner on his own intelligence and ability to turn into \nHulk\n. Director \nNick Fury\n then suggested Stark and Banner work together to try and understand Loki's \nScepter\n, with \nCaptain America\n comparing it to a \nHYDRA\n weapon. While Captain America still struggled to understand a lot of the team's new modern references, Stark and Banner departed for the lap to begin their research, but not before Stark planted a hacking device and allowed \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to begin searching \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's database to find out its secrets about why the \nAvengers\n were assembled.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tests \nBruce Banner\n's temper control\n \n \nStark talked with Banner in their new lab as they discussed all of Selvig's work and inviting him to come work at \nStark Tower\n for a stress free work place, despite Banner claiming that he \nbroke\n \nHarlem\n last time he was in \nNew York City\n. Stark then tried once to annoy Banner by poking him with a prod in order to test his ability to resist his transformation, only to get no response apart from pain before Captain America entered and demanded he stop, as Banner's transformation would put all the lives on the Helicarrier at risk.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark still continues mocking \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nStark wondered if Banner used jazz or marijuana to keep his cool, to which Captain America found less than funny, telling Stark he was risking the lives of everyone on board the Helicarrier and should be focusing on the issues at hand. Stark, however, suggested that Fury might have other motives for restarting the \nAvengers Initiative\n, although Captain America was unconvinced. Banner noted that Loki's comments could have been referring to Stark Tower and the power it supplied. Captain America once again told Stark to remain focused on locating the Tesseract, only for Stark to insult his \nuniform\n and send him out of his lab. Stark rudely commented on how \nhis father\n had so often admired Captain America having worked with him back in \nWorld War II\n.\n[\n15\n]\nTeam Tension\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nBruce Banner\n discuss Hulk\n \n \n\"You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.\"\n\"I think I would just cut the wire.\"\n\"Always a way out.

Stark then told Banner about how his \nArc Reactor\n was keeping the shrapnel he gained from \nhis kidnapping\n away from his heart, calling it a terrible privilege, with Banner claiming his situation was not the same. Stark noted all the \ngamma radiation\n Banner was exposed to should have killed him and maybe Hulk saved his life.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark manages to hack into \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \n \nStark and Banner learned that \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n was trying to harness the \nTesseract\n's powers to begin \nPhase 2\n and create weapons of mass destruction. \nNick Fury\n soon learned of their schemes and challenged them both, with them soon being joined by \nCaptain America\n who had also found out that S.H.I.E.L.D. was using \nHYDRA\n's technology to learn how to harness it, based on the \nRed Skull\n's designs. Just as Fury tried to defend his actions, Stark contradicted him, forcing Fury to confess they were building the weapons in response to \nThor\n and the recent \nBattle of Puente Antiguo\n which they were unprepared for.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark debating heroism with \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nWhile Banner called their new team a time bomb, Stark got into a heated argument with Captain America who claimed that Stark was not a hero but a selfish man in a \nsuit of armor\n, while Stark noted that Captain America was only a hero because of the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n given to him by \nStark's father\n and \nAbraham Erskine\n, leading to Stark challenging him to a fight. During an ensuing argument between the \nAvengers\n, Banner inadvertently picked up \nLoki\n's \nScepter\n, revealing Loki's control over him. All of Loki's troops then arrived, led by the brainwashed \nClint Barton\n, and attacked the \nHelicarrier\n in order to free Loki.\n[\n15\n]\nDefending the Helicarrier\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man begins repairing the \nHelicarrier\n \n \n\"Cap, hit the lever.\"\n\"I need a minute here!\"\n\"Lever.

Iron Man arrived and soon assessed the damage, recruiting \nCaptain America\n to help him by checking all the main controls while Iron Man went inside the engine: However, Iron Man was soon frustrated when Captain America struggled to understand the modern technology that he was currently looking at due to his lack of exposure to any of it.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man cuts the damaged propeller\n \n \nWhile Iron Man and Captain America were working together by the damaged engine, \nNick Fury\n and \nMaria Hill\n were unable to stop Hawkeye using one of \nhis arrows\n to shut down the Helicarrier's power, causing it to fall out of the sky, dramatically shortening the time Iron Man had to save the day. Upon arriving at the engine itself, Iron Man used his laser to cut through the damaged propeller and decided to use his armor's \nArc Reactor\n to restart the engine by hand, telling Captain America to pull a lever in order to free him from the engine before he got shredded inside it when it moved too fast.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man restarts the \nHelicarrier\n's engine\n \n \nIron Man put all of his might into pushing the engine in order to get in spinning fast enough to lift the Helicarrier back up into the air, saving all of the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n Agents on board. However, Iron Man soon found it was beginning to move too fast for him to keep up and then asked Captain America to pull the lever, only to learn Captain America was now busy fighting \nLoki\n's mind-controlled soldiers. Iron Man was briefly trapped and badly damaged by the propeller until Captain America managed to free him just in time.

When medical assistance was called in for Coulson, it was soon confirmed that he had in fact died from all of his wounds, news which shook Stark to his very core.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens to \nNick Fury\n's speech\n \n \nStark and \nSteve Rogers\n were then gathered together in the control room where \nNick Fury\n expressed his own deep regret for Coulson's death, presenting Rogers with the \nCaptain America Card Collection\n he had asked him to sign. While Stark listened in silence, Fury then explained they could not locate the \nTesseract\n, confessing that he was planning on recreating \nHYDRA\n weapons with its power before he informed the two that the \nAvengers Initiative\n was started so the isolated individuals could become something more and that Coulson died still believing this. Hearing this, Stark got to his feet.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark refuses to follow \nNick Fury\n's orders\n \n \nVisiting the site of Coulson's murder at Loki's hand, Stark began talking with Rogers about how Coulson did not have family, but was dating \nAudrey Nathan\n. When Rogers called him a good man, Stark called him an idiot for challenging Loki with the \nDestroyer Armor Prototype Gun\n on his own. Stark began claiming that they were not soldiers in a war and he would not be following Fury any longer, noting about how Loki made it personal to draw them in. Rogers went to dismiss the comment but Stark noted that making it personal was Loki's plan, to rip their new team apart.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark realizes \nLoki\n is at \nStark Tower\n \n \nWhile rambling on about the theatrics that Loki has pulled off as part of his grand plan for \nworld domination\n, Stark began to draw closer to finding out where the \nAsgardian\n God of Mischief would set off the portal to bring his \nalien army\n forth, commenting on how Loki wanted his victory to be seen by the world. At that moment, Stark realized he had built something out of ego, \nStark Tower\n, and it would provide both the perfect source of energy to open the portal and serve as a taunt. With a \"son of a bitch\" escaping his lips, Stark then informed Rogers of his epiphany before quickly walking out of the room.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark repairs \nMark VI Iron Man Armor\n \n \nWith this new lead, Rogers put on his \nuniform\n and regrouped with the other available \nAvengers\n while Stark repaired the \nMark VI Iron Man Armor\n so it was battle ready again. Fueled by a desire to avenge Agent Coulson's death, Stark soon had his armor ready to go into battle. While Captain America, \nBlack Widow\n, and \nHawkeye\n, who had now been freed from Loki's mind control, left on board a \nQuinjet\n which they had stolen from \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, Iron Man flew himself straight to \nNew York City\n in order to finally confront Loki and end his attack, although he found the armor still lost some power along the way.\n[\n15\n]\nConfronting Loki\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to destroy the portal device\n \n \n\"There's no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top.

Iron Man ordered \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to cut the power from the tower, only learn the portal device was already self-sustaining. Failing to convince Selvig to shut down the device, Iron Man blasted it; however, the barrier around the device bounced the blast back.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark engages a battle of wits against \nLoki\n \n \nIron Man saw that \nLoki\n was watching in amusement from the balcony of Stark's penthouse and, seeing that there was now nothing else he could do to stop the \ninvasion\n, Stark decided to change tactics, land on a platform, remove the \nMark VI Iron Man Armor\n and face off against Loki without any defenses. In a sense of hospitality, Stark offered Loki a drink, but he declined before Stark \"threatened\" Loki. To buy time to put on his two \nColantotte Bracelets\n, Stark then promised Loki that he would be stopped by the \nAvengers\n no matter how long it took them, although Loki still remained unintimidated by the concept.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is protected from \nLoki\n's \nScepter\n \n \nStark listed off all the Avengers members to show what Loki was up against, seeing Loki cringe at the mention of \nThor\n. Loki insisted that his \nChitauri\n army would overcome them with ease, so Stark then noted that they had a \nHulk\n on their own side. Stark then promised that even if the Avengers failed to protect the \nEarth\n, they would at least avenge it by defeating Loki. The now furious Loki promised that the Avengers would have no time for him when they were fighting a brainwashed Stark. When Loki attempted to enthrall him, the \nArc Reactor\n in Stark's chest was blocking the \nScepter\n from Stark's heart.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man shoots \nLoki\n in \nPhil Coulson\n's name\n \n \nMaking a performance joke, Stark was suddenly attacked by Loki who vowed to destroy the Avengers before Stark was then thrown out of the window hundreds of feet above the ground. However, Stark just managed to call for the \nMark VII Iron Man Armor\n; it was rocket-propelled to him, and formed the suit around him by connecting to the Colantotte Bracelets he had put on right before he could hit the ground. Iron Man flew back up to Loki and told him there was one other person Loki had pissed off; \nPhil Coulson\n, and blasted Loki backwards before he could even react in the name of the late Agent Coulson.\n[\n15\n]\nBattle of New York\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attacking all the incoming \nChitauri\n \n \n\"Call it, Captain.\"\n\"All right, listen up.

Amazed at what he was witnessing, Iron Man charged upwards and fired all of the \nMark VII Iron Man Armor\n's weapons upon the attacking alien forces. Iron Man recruited the help of \nHawkeye\n by flying by the \nQuinjet\n and having him shoot the aliens out of the sky behind him while mockingly asking if they had stopped for drive-thru as they were so late to the fight.\n[\n15\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man successfully destroys a \nLeviathan\n \n \nIron Man fought off the \nChitauri\n and tried to call \nWar Machine\n, who told Iron Man that he was too busy fighting soldiers working for the \nTen Rings\n, but would come to help as soon as possible.\n[\n38\n]\n Iron Man then began to chase after a \nLeviathan\n, a flying giant alien serpent and the warship to dozens of Chitauri. When he was notified of the arrival of \nBruce Banner\n on the field, Iron Man led the flying serpent towards him, saying he was bringing the party to the others, so that Banner would transform into Hulk and defeat it, with Iron Man firing a tank missile at the Leviathan to destroy it's body and finally kill it.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man listens to \nCaptain America\n's orders\n \n \nIron Man landed on the ground alongside his fellow \nAvengers\n. The team were then confronted by hundreds of Chitauri who flew in through the portal as well as several more Leviathans. \nCaptain America\n gave out orders and instructed Iron Man to take to the skies and fend off more Chitauri as well as keep them within \nNew York City\n. Captain America then ordered Hawkeye to get onto the roof of one of the skyscrapers in order to inform them of the Chitauri's movements during the battle while also sharpshooting them, so Iron Man flew him up there while Captain America gave out his orders to the other Avengers.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is chased by \nChitauri Chariots\n \n \nAs the \nBattle of New York\n began, Iron Man focused on his task of insuring that the Chitauri forces did not leave the city and wreak havoc elsewhere. He soon found himself being chased down by multiple \nChitauri Chariots\n which attempted to shoot him out of the sky, until Hawkeye advised Iron Man to fly towards a tight corner as he noted the Chitauri weren't as good at maneuvering their craft as he was. Iron Man did as recommended and successfully caused the Chitauri Chariots to crash into nearby buildings. However, despite \nThor\n's best efforts to block the portal, they still continued coming through.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights alongside \nCaptain America\n \n \nCharging throughout the entire battlefield, Iron Man came to the aid of \nBlack Widow\n who was currently riding one of the Chitauri Chariots to try and reach \nStark Tower\n, who Iron Man soon shot the pursuing Chitauri out of the sky to ensure she could get there. Iron Man then charged through multiple aliens to team up with Captain America, as they used \nhis shield\n to deflect Iron Man's gauntlet blasts across the multiple enemies, increasing its power as a result. Iron Man then aided Hawkeye by knocking several Chitauri off the building he was on before they could get to him as he continued flying.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to destroy another \nLeviathan\n \n \nHaving been told by \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n that all his lasers were not cutting through a Leviathan's armored skin, Iron Man took inspiration from the tale of \nJonah\n by taking out the Leviathan by flying head-first into its mouth and launching missiles from the inside, tearing it apart before crash landing on the street.\n[\n15\n]\n However, Iron Man soon got battered by numerous attacks. Iron Man asked Thor if he had ever seen \nGame of Thrones\n, saying he reminded him of it. Thor asked him how he can joke around during the battle, but was then eaten by a Leviathan. Out of rage, Thor used \nMjlnir\n to get out of the Leviathan.\n[\n43\n]\nStopping the Nuke\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man just intercepts a nuclear missile\n \n \n\"I got a \nnuke\n coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.

Iron Man hindered this as \nNick Fury\n had instructed him that \nGideon Malick\n and the \nWorld Security Council\n had fired a \nnuclear missile\n to blow up Manhattan in hopes of ending the invasion. Iron Man soon intercepted the missile and demanded that Black Widow keep the portal open, despite \nCaptain America\n wishing to close it as soon as possible to end the invasion while they still could.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark falls back through the \nwormhole\n \n \nIron Man flew it up through \nNew York City\n and up alongside \nStark Tower\n and finally straight through the portal as he was taken into deep space. Iron Man looked in amazement at what was before him, all while he lost contact with \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n and the oxygen swiftly ran out. As he lost consciousness, Iron Man released the nuclear missile and blew up the \nChitauri Command Center\n, which resulted in the deaths of the \nChitauri\n and \nLeviathans\n across the city. However, Iron Man lost power in the \nMark VII Iron Man Armor\n in the process and then fell unconscious back through the portal just before it closed.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark regains consciousness\n \n \nAs Iron Man fell back to Earth, he was caught midair by \nHulk\n who landed with him back on the ground. Captain America and \nThor\n ran over to Iron Man who appeared to be dead, only for Hulk to scream in his face, waking him up. Iron Man said they should get some \nshawarma\n to celebrate, despite not knowing what shawarma was. Thor told him they'd do that later, since \nLoki\n still needed to be apprehended.\n[\n15\n]\nBattle Aftermath\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and the \nAvengers\n confront \nLoki\n \n \n\"If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now.\"\n\"All right, get him on his feet. \nWe\n can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up.\"\n\nLoki\n and Iron Man\n[src]\nIron Man and the rest of the \nAvengers\n returned to \nStark Tower\n, where they found the defeated Loki. As Loki asked if he could have the drink Iron Man offered earlier, Iron Man merely told the other Avengers to apprehend Loki while noting the mess around him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark with the captured \nLoki\n \n \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n's \nSTRIKE\n team then showed up to take possession of the \nScepter\n, while Stark focused on safely securing the \nTesseract\n in a silver case, with \nThor\n intending it to bring it back to \nAsgard\n. Stark, Thor and Loki, along with a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, began to take the elevator down the lobby, but as \nHulk\n moved to join them, Stark reminded him that the elevator had a weight capacity and motioned that he take the stairs instead, angering Hulk.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark helps escort \nLoki\n out of \nStark Tower\n \n \nAs Stark and Thor made their way through the lobby, they were halted by \nAlexander Pierce\n of the \nWorld Security Council\n, which oversaw S.H.I.E.L.D. Pierce demanded that Thor and Stark relinquish custody of Loki and the Tesseract respectively to him, although Thor refused, citing that Loki would be returning to Asgard and would be punished by \nOdin\n. Pierce then ordered Stark to hand over the Tesseract, citing that it had been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for seventy years.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and the others eat \nShawarma Palace\n \n \nAfter Stark and Thor refused to relinquish the Tesseract, Pierce attempted to grab the case when Stark would not comply. Pierce's efforts were in naught, as Thor was allowed to take Loki and the Tesseract back with him to Asgard.\n[\n8\n]\n Following the altercation, Stark and the other Avengers went into the \nShawarma Palace\n where they all ate silently.\n[\n15\n]\n They were soon interrupted by \nWar Machine\n, who arrived from the \nBattle of Hong Kong\n, and too late to aid Stark and the rest of the Avengers in battle.\n[\n44\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says his goodbyes to \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nAfter their meal, the Avengers met in \nCentral Park\n, witnessing Thor and Loki's return to Asgard using the Tesseract. The team then went their separate ways; with Stark saying goodbye to \nSteve Rogers\n and shaking his hand before he drove away in his \nAcura 2012 Stark Industries Super Car\n with Banner by his side. Stark was later with \nPepper Potts\n in \nStark Tower\n ready to rebuild after the damage that was done.\n[\n15\n]\nAfter New York\n[\n]\nDamage Control\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark founding \nDamage Control\n \n \nFeeling all the guilt of his recent actions involving the \nBattle of New York\n, Stark announced to the public that he has committed funds and resources to aid and helping \nNew York City\n rebuild its infrastructure after the battle.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\n He also invested into the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n in order to clear up the wreckage left behind by the \nChitauri\n and the \nLeviathans\n that now littered \nNew York City\n. Putting \nAnne Marie Hoag\n in charge of the newly established Damage Control, Stark had Hoag take control away from \nAdrian Toomes' Crew\n to work on the clear up of the battle's aftermath, much to \nAdrian Toomes\n' great dismay.\n[\n47\n]\nStealing B.A.R.F.\n[\n]\nStark discovered that \nQuentin Beck\n, an employee at \nStark Industries\n, created holographic technology capable of producing powerful, realistic illusions. Stark decided to use Beck's invention for therapeutic pursuits and renamed the technology as \nBinarily Augmented Retro-Framing\n, or B.A.R.F. for short.\n[\n7\n]\n Beck filed a patent for his invention, although it did not go through.\n[\n48\n]\n Stark then filed a patent for B.A.R.F. himself, although he took out Beck's name and listed himself as the inventor; the patent then went through, legally listing Stark as the creator for the technology.\n[\n49\n]\nThe Iron Legion\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark showing off the \nIron Legion\n \n \n\"Iron Man's not enough.

For what's coming, we're gonna need an \nIron Legion\n.\"\nTony Stark to \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nStark invited \nJames Rhodes\n to his workshop in \nMalibu\n. Seeing that not even the combined powers of Iron Man and \nWar Machine\n would be enough to protect the \nEarth\n from the next threat from the \nNine Realms\n, Stark showed Rhodes several Iron Man armors that could be remotely controlled. He called them the \"\nIron Legion\n\".\n[\n44\n]\n When Stark was presenting how he could now charge his new \narmor\n from solar energy at \nStark Tower\n, when he was suddenly attacked by a villain called the \nMelter\n, who he defeated and put him in the \nUnited States Armed Forces\n' custody with \nWar Machine\n's assistance.\n[\n50\n]\nMandarin Threat\n[\n]\nArmor Obsession\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tests out the new \nMark XLII\n armor\n \n \n\"I guess seventy-two hours is a long time between siestas.

That's when \nhe\n happened.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nBy Christmastime \n2013\n,\n[\n35\n]\n Stark had built up the \nIron Legion\n, creating new suits for all possible eventualities. While in his \nMalibu Mansion\n, Stark tested out the new \nMark XLII\n, which was built so that he could now activate and summon various pieces of the armor when needed using micro-repeaters implanted in his body. Stark ignored \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n's concern about his lack of sleep and the armor's safety briefing, recruiting \nDum-E and U\n to assist him in filming the newest test to \nBombay Dub Orchestra\n's \"Jingle Bells.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man suits up with his latest armor\n \n \nStark successfully summoned both of his gauntlets, deciding to have the entire armor assemble at once. However, due to glitches, the pieces started coming too fast to properly attach, forcing Stark to dodge the flying projectiles as they damaged his workshop, with the face and crotch plates hurting him if they impacted by themselves. After slowing down the armor assembly, Stark only had the face plate left and noticed it was upside down, so he flipped himself over to help it fit. Just as Stark celebrated, a final piece for his backside knocked him over, causing the entire suit to fall apart.\nRight after testing the new armor, Stark watched the television, only to see that the terrorist the \nMandarin\n had made yet another attack on the \nUnited States of America\n. At the same time, \nJames Rhodes\n had his own \nsuit\n rebranded as \nIron Patriot\n under President \nMatthew Ellis\n' direct orders.\n[\n4\n]\nMental Struggle\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark has lunch with \nJames Rhodes\n \n \n\"You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech. I got a prehensile, I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.\"\n\"When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?\"\n\"\nEinstein\n slept three hours a year. Look what he did.\"\nTony Stark and \nJames Rhodes\n[src]\nStark met with \nJames Rhodes\n at \nNeptune's Net\n for lunch, where he spent much of his time mocking the new \nIron Patriot\n identity, being told that it had tested well with focus groups; the government felt that \"\nWar Machine\n\" was too violent a name, which would send the wrong message. Stark then asked Rhodes about the \nMandarin\n's attacks, wanting to know the facts regarding the terrorist.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark asks to help \nJames Rhodes\n \n \nRhodes revealed the explosions' origins were unknown due to no bomb casings left behind. Stark argued that he was more than capable of helping with the mission thanks to his advanced \nIron Legion\n, though Rhodes worried that his friend's recent actions were negatively impacting his health. \nTwo\n \nchildren\n then approached and asked Stark to sign a drawn picture, which he agreed to. The picture showed him in the \nBattle of New York\n diverting the missile into the \nportal\n above \nStark Tower\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark runs into his armor for getting anxiety\n \n \nAs Rhodes continued insisting that Stark let the \nPentagon\n handle the Mandarin since the public is still on edge from the \nChitauri Invasion\n, Stark suddenly lost focus and scribbled a message for help on the drawing, reminded of his near-death experience. The boy asked how Stark escaped the wormhole, leading him to experience a severe anxiety attack as he recalled what he had seen in the battle. Stark rushed to put on his \nMark VII\n suit to test for any faults in his physiology, only to learn nothing was wrong. Taken aback, he then left to return \nhome\n and resume work on his suits.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is updated on things by \nHappy Hogan\n \n \nAfter completing and storing away the \nMark XLII\n, Stark called \nHappy Hogan\n to get an update on what was happening at \nStark Industries\n, where Hogan was now head of security. After Hogan complained about all of his experiences and embarrassments as Iron Man's bodyguard, he told Stark that \nPepper Potts\n was currently having a pitch meeting with \nAldrich Killian\n at the \nheadquarters\n, although he failed to flip the screen to show Stark their conversation.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark studies \nAldrich Killian\n's new research\n \n \nHaving discussed meeting Killian in \nSwitzerland\n back in \n1999\n, Stark and Hogan then conferred if Hogan should follow him, as he did not trust Killian nor the man's bodyguard, \nEric Savin\n. While Hogan advised Stark to pay more attention to Potts, Stark said he missed his friend, with Hogan noting that he missed him too but also how Stark spent more time with the \nAvengers\n now. Stark promptly hung up the call and left his phone inside the wine cellar to continue working.\n[\n4\n]\nAnxiety Confession\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark remotely controls his newest \narmor\n \n \n\"I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know. I tinker. But, threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you.\"\nTony Stark to \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nAs Christmas was nearing, Stark decided to show \nPepper Potts\n his love for her by buying a large stuffed bunny as her gift. Unfortunately, it was too big to fit through \nhis mansion\n's door, so he would need to have the wall taken down to get it inside. Deciding to test his new \nremote-control unit\n, Stark had his \nMark XLII\n armor sit on the sofa and wait for Potts to come home. Once she arrived and greeted him, Stark lied that he was breaking in the armor.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is soon caught out by \nPepper Potts\n \n \nHowever, his ruse fell apart when Potts wanted to open the armor to kiss him; she went down to Stark's workshop, catching him watching news reports on the \nMandarin\n. Stark managed to quell Potts' anger by explaining how he's been feeling like an amateur in the big leagues since the \nBattle of New York\n; he's just a man in a suit against \nAsgardians\n, \nportals\n to other worlds and the \nChitauri\n coming through. Stark then admitted that probably the only reason he had not snapped is because Potts moved in with him, for which he is greatly thankful. However, he was also been plagued by nightmares about these hostile forces attacking what he loves most: her.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark confesses the truth to \nPepper Potts\n \n \nBecause of this, Stark spent most of his time, even when Potts is asleep, building more and more of the \nIron Legion\n to help protect her. Potts comforted him, understanding why he'd been so distant from her since getting involved with the \nAvengers\n. As she then left to wash up for bed, Potts turned around and offered to have Stark join her in the shower to cheer him up. Stark agreed, hoping not only to lighten his mood, but try closing the gap forming between them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark suffers from nightmares\n \n \nLater that night, Stark attempted to have a good night's sleep, but suffered visions of himself in the \nChitauri Invasion\n, causing him to go into distress as he recalled almost dying while destroying the \nChitauri Command Center\n. Potts tried to rouse Stark until the Mark XLII armor came to his aid due to responding to his brainwaves, seeing her as a threat. Stark awoke and deactivated the armor before apologizing to a terrified Potts, who left him alone in bed.\n[\n4\n]\nThreatening Mandarin\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark stays by \nHappy Hogan\n's hospital bed\n \n \n\"My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of \nyou\n.

There's no \nPentagon\n, it's just you and me.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nHappy Hogan\n was caught up in the \nDestruction of the Chinese Theatre\n, seemingly caused by the \nTen Rings\n working under the orders of the \nMandarin\n. Stark visited his friend at the \nCedars-Sinai Hospital\n, ensuring that the nurses kept \nDownton Abbey\n, Hogan's favorite program, on television and they all wore ID tags since Hogan was a \"stickler\" for those.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is surrounded outside by all the media\n \n \nHaving ensured that Hogan's health recovery was as comfortable as it could be, a distressed Stark prepared to return home while he was mobbed by the press who had requested a statement about the true cause of the blast. Stark ignored all of the questions and made his way to his car until he was stopped upon being asked if he would kill the Mandarin and put an end to his war against the \nUnited States of America\n. Stark immediately turned around upon being asked this.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark publicly threatens the \nMandarin\n's life\n \n \nHe then issued a public threat to the Mandarin, calling him a coward who hid behind the Ten Rings and would not dare face him alone. Without a second thought due to his rage at Hogan's injuries, Stark revealed the address of his \nMalibu Mansion\n so they could face off. As he left, Stark smashed the reporter's phone and told him to send him the bill. This resulted in numerous news choppers flying around Stark's home, waiting to film \nIron Man\n vs. the Mandarin.\n[\n4\n]\nMandarin Research\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark researches the \nMandarin\n's attacks\n \n \n\"Okay. What do we got here? \nHis\n name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning 'Adviser to the King'. South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here.\"\nTony Stark to \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nStark ended up fighting with \nPepper Potts\n over leaving the \nMalibu Mansion\n for their own safety, since he carelessly gave up his real address. Stark spent his time in the workshop creating a database on the \nMandarin\n, and recreated the \nexplosion\n which left \nHappy Hogan\n in a coma, searching for any clues that he could find as to what \ncaused\n the fireball that had killed several people.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finds a vital clue about the explosion\n \n \nWith new information from \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n databases, Stark tried to learn who the Mandarin really was. Viewing the holograph of Hogan, Stark found he was pointing at a dog tag belonging to \nJack Taggart\n near the center of the explosion; using this clue, he looked for records of similar explosions of 3,000C. Ruling out the Mandarin attacks, Stark eventually found one case in \nRose Hill\n, \nTennessee\n, seemingly caused by \nChad Davis\n committing suicide with a bomb vest.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man being reunited with \nMaya Hansen\n \n \nTo Stark's surprise, the doorbell rang; \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n informed him that there was only so much he could do since Stark had told the world his address. Donning the \nMark XLII\n, Stark confronted his visitor, only to find \nMaya Hansen\n instead of the Mandarin. Stark eventually realized she was the \"botanist\" he met in \nSwitzerland\n but initially mistook Hansen's comments about needing to get him alone as an offer for sex. Stark turned her down, explaining that he was now in a happily committed relationship with Potts, which amused Hansen.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark has an argument with \nPepper Potts\n \n \nAt that moment, Potts dropped luggage from the second floor. Stark nervously asked Hansen if their one-night-stand had resulted in a child. After teasing him by hinting this might be true, Hansen assured Stark that it was not the case and she needed to talk to him about the Mandarin, bluntly warning that he would be killed otherwise. As Hansen met Potts, Stark continued protesting her desire for them to leave the city, insisting he needed to confront the Mandarin and could better protect Potts if they stayed. When Hansen tried to help move them out, Stark stopped her and ended up yelling in frustration about the rabbit he had bought Potts.\n[\n4\n]\nAttacked by the Mandarin\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nPepper Potts\n witness the attack\n \n \n\"J.A.R.V.I.S., where's my flight power?\"\n\"Working on it, sir. \nThis\n is a prototype.\"\nTony Stark and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n[src]\nHowever, as Stark and \nPepper Potts\n were still arguing about what action they should take next, \nMaya Hansen\n turned their attention towards their television, which showed a missile currently heading straight towards the \nmansion\n fired by \nEric Savin\n. Before they could react, the missile struck the side of the Mansion and sent the pair flying back. With seconds to spare before hitting the wall, Stark signaled his \nMark XLII\n armor onto Potts, protecting her as they slammed into it, with Stark taking the brunt of the impact.\n \n \n \n \n \nPepper Potts\n saves Stark from debris\n \n \nHaving been winded by the impact of striking the wall hard, Stark attempted to crawl away but noticed a large chunk of the ceiling was about to fall and crush him. However, Potts appeared wearing his armor and saved his life. Stark claimed to have always said it was not safe to stay in the Mansion and told Potts that they needed to get out. Upon being separated as the Mansion \nfell apart\n, Stark ordered Potts to get an unconscious Hansen to safety outside.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man prepares to fight all the attackers\n \n \nWhile Potts pulled Hansen from the rubble, Stark was forced to avoid the helicopters' attacks as they tried to shoot him down. Once \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n confirmed that Potts and Hansen made it outside, Stark summoned the armor back to himself. Still avoiding the gunshots, Stark collected all the sections of the Iron Man armor, getting saved from a bullet in the back just in time, before triumphantly rising to his feet as he prepared to fight back against his attackers.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights back against the helicopters\n \n \nIron Man was unable to call upon the \nIron Legion\n due to the Mansion falling apart around him and trapping them under rubble, so he was forced to defend himself using the new prototype armor, which lacked the offensive abilities of his battle armors. Despite being warned by J.A.R.V.I.S. that both the suit's flight and weapons protocols were not ready and needed time to charge, Iron Man continued fending off the helicopters surrounding him. When a missile had failed to fire, he then simply threw it at the helicopter and shot it with his repulsor, destroying the helicopter in the resulting explosion while the others still fired.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is dragged down into the ocean\n \n \nTaking out a second helicopter by launching his grand piano at it, Iron Man had another missile fire at him and fell through the floor into his workshop. Iron Man helplessly watched as \nDum-E and U\n were destroyed along with his armors from \nMark I\n to \nMark VII\n, which were consumed in fireballs. Having been outgunned, Iron Man was pulled into the ocean while his home and possessions were all demolished over him, as the suit was still without adequate power to fly himself to safety.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man manages to escape from drowning\n \n \nAs the Mark XLII began filling with water, causing Iron Man begin drowning, Savin and the other attack choppers circled above the wreckage, looking for any signs of life. Iron Man was saved when J.A.R.V.I.S. took control of his gauntlet and used it to pull him out of the wreckage and fly away just in time as the power had been restored. Escaping, Iron Man lost consciousness from the strain and left J.A.R.V.I.S. in charge of the suit's flight path.\n[\n4\n]\nStranded in Tennessee\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man crash lands into the snow\n \n \n\"Pepper, it's me.

Unfortunately, since the \nMark XLII\n was still a prototype and highly damaged from use, it lacked the link to the \nArc Reactor\n to sustain its own power. Therefore, Stark awoke just as the suit crash-landed in the middle of rural Ross Hill and lost power, including the link to J.A.R.V.I.S. This left Stark in the cold, with nothing left but his own genius to help him find a solution.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is forced to pull his armor behind him\n \n \nLacking the power to return to \nCalifornia\n and with the world at large believing him to be dead from the \ndestruction of his mansion\n, Stark dragged the Mark XLII behind him as he looked for shelter. Finding a phone booth, Stark called his system back home, leaving a private message for \nPepper Potts\n. Apologizing for putting her in harm's way, Stark stated that he still had to find the Mandarin and therefore, he could not return home just yet, urging Potts to protect herself in the meantime.\n[\n4\n]\nMeeting Harley Keener\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark relaxes beside his damaged armor\n \n \n\"Which happens.

A laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.\"\nTony Stark to \nHarley Keener\n[src]\nStark broke into a garage belonging to the family of ten-year-old \nHarley Keener\n, where he laid down the Mark XLII and attempted to fix the damaged parts until he was discovered by Keener. Despite being threatened with a potato gun, Stark found that he got along well with Keener, who soon reminded Stark of a younger version of himself, a child genius; Keener admired the Mark XLII armor and had recommended using new retro-reflection panels to create a stealth armor, although he claimed to prefer the \nIron Patriot\n name over \nWar Machine\n for \nJames Rhodes\n, which Stark highly disagreed with.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark blackmails \nHarley Keener\n into helping\n \n \nHaving discussed Keener's home life where he was growing up without a father, Stark mocked him by noting his own \nfather\n was not there for him. Stark then requested that Keener find him a digital watch, a cell phone, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich. Stark offered Keener a flash grenade from his suit in exchange, recognizing the signs of a kid being \nbullied\n, which Keener accepted while Stark demanded he get his sandwich.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark visits the site of \nChad Davis\n' suicide\n \n \nStark enlisted Keener's help in finding the truth behind the terrorist bombings seemingly involving the \nTen Rings\n and the \nMandarin\n. While being led to the site, Stark complained about the \nDora the Explorer\n watch he was given. Upon examining the site of the explosion, Stark realized something was amiss as there was no ash-imprint of \nChad Davis\n, who died, and the blast was similar to the \nDestruction of the Chinese Theatre\n, with no bomb parts being found.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark suffers from yet another panic attack\n \n \nHowever, when Keener started asking him about the \nBattle of New York\n, the \nAvengers\n and whether or not the \nChitauri\n would return, Stark started having another panic attack. At this point, Stark admitted that he should have been on medication to deal with his \nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n. Having pulled himself back together and thrown a snowball at Keener, Stark asked where \nMrs. Davis\n could be found, with Keener directing him to a local \nbar\n.\n[\n4\n]\nBattle of Rose Hill\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark accidentally bumps into \nEllen Brandt\n \n \n\"Do you like that, \nWestworld\n? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass.\"\nTony Stark to \nEric Savin\n[src]\nSeeking information, Stark set up a meeting with \nMrs. Davis\n, the mother of recently killed \nExtremis\n-infected soldier \nChad Davis\n. Arriving outside \nWalker's\n where he had been told he could find Davis, Stark bumped into \nEllen Brandt\n, who complimented his \nDora the Explorer\n watch, which he proudly noted was limited edition while also complimenting Brandt.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark asks \nMrs. Davis\n about her \nson\n's death\n \n \nInside, Stark soon found Mrs. Davis, offering her his condolences for the death of her son. To Stark's surprise, Davis handed him a file on her son's work with \nA.I.M.\n, which he had not asked for and held key information regarding Chad's death, showing that he had worked along with \nJack Taggart\n. Stark told Davis that he believed her son did not commit suicide but was instead used as a weapon, at which point Davis realized Stark was not who she expected.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark runs from \nEllen Brandt\n and \nEric Savin\n \n \nStark and Davis were then interrupted by Brandt, who revealed she was the one that contacted Davis and attempted to arrest Stark. When the \nRose Hill Sheriff\n tried to stop this and questioned what was happening, Brandt claimed to be from \nHomeland Security\n before she suddenly used her \nExtremis\n powers to murder the Sheriff while Davis hid the file and Stark ran out, still handcuffed. Outside, Stark encountered \nEric Savin\n, forcing him to run for his safety.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to fight against \nEllen Brandt\n \n \nHarley Keener\n briefly distracted Savin before he could shoot Stark. Pursued by Brandt into a restaurant, Stark was forced to \nfight against\n the highly trained soldier with no weapons to defend himself. As they fought, Stark noticed that Brandt could heal from most injuries and super-heat anything she touched, using this to burn through his handcuffs. Stark bought himself time to set up a bomb by igniting some fuel with his cuffs to block Brandt's way.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tricks and defeats \nEllen Brandt\n \n \nWhile Brandt walked through the flames, Stark put Chad's dog tags in the microwave and opened a gas valve. As she stepped inside the kitchen, Stark joked that he had dated hotter girls than Brandt, who was currently on fire, and she questioned if those would be his final words. Stark replied that they could be the title of his autobiography before fleeing outside and hiding behind an ice machine. An explosion then erupted, killing Brandt.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark saves \nHarley Keener\n from \nEric Savin\n \n \nAs Stark recovered from his fight with Brandt, he suddenly witnessed Savin using his own Extremis powers to bring a water tower crashing down, trapping Stark underneath all of the debris. Savin then held Keener hostage in order to regain Davis' file, but Stark reminded Keener about the flash grenade he had given him from the \nMark XLII\n Armor; this allowed Keener to escape, allowing Stark to then blast Savin with a secret spare repulsor.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says his goodbyes to \nHarley Keener\n \n \nStealing Savin's car keys from his pocket, Stark commandeered his car, taking off with the file from Davis. As Stark prepared to leave, he was followed by Keener, who insisted that Stark thank him for saving him from Savin, but Stark insisted that Keener instead go home to his mother and protect the Mark XLII armor until Stark contacted him. As he left, Stark did thank Keener for all his help but teased him as he drove out of \nRose Hill\n.\n[\n4\n]\nLocating Mandarin\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark calls \nJames Rhodes\n for assistance\n \n \n\"I'm chasing bad guys.

Pump it up by about 40%.\"\nTony Stark to \nGary\n[src]\nWhile driving \nEric Savin\n's car, Stark called \nJames Rhodes\n, who was overseas hunting down the \nMandarin\n as well. Stark reminded Rhodes how \nlast time\n he had vanished, Rhodes had searched for him before requesting the login to his Comsat. Rhodes eventually revealed that his password was \"\nWARMACHINEROX\n,\" much to Stark's great amusement and Rhodes' own embarrassment.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is discovered by the excitable \nGary\n \n \nStark found a nearby pageant and broke into a \nWZPZ\n van in order to use their computers to find out what he needed to know. While inside, Stark was confronted by the cameraman \nGary\n, who froze upon realizing who was there as he was a huge fan of Stark and the \nAvengers\n, noting that he had not believed Stark was killed in the \ndestruction of his mansion\n. Stark amused all of Gary's requests to show his tattoo of Stark and recruited his help.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns about all \nAldrich Killian\n's plans\n \n \nStark used Gary's own satellite connection to hack into \nA.I.M.\n's systems, which the file reported was responsible for \nChad Davis\n' death. He watched footage of \nAldrich Killian\n recruiting Davis along with \nEllen Brandt\n and \nJack Taggart\n before they were injected with \nExtremis\n, which enhanced their strength and regrew their limbs. Upon seeing one test subject exploding, Stark realized Killian must have sold his technology to the \nTen Rings\n to use as human weapons.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is mentally helped by \nHarley Keener\n \n \nStark called \nHarley Keener\n to check on how the suit was doing; the armor was now 58% charged, and \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n kept saying the wrong word at the end of each sentence. Asking for Mandarin's location, Stark heard \nMiami\n was it; thinking J.A.R.V.I.S. had misspoken again, Stark asked Keener to read it aloud. To Stark's shock, the location was correct; this sent him into a panic attack, as he did not have any of his armors or a way to call in the Avengers to help.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to confront \nMandarin\n \n \nTrying to keep Stark calm as he recalled the \nBattle of New York\n, which made him panic even more, Keener suggested that Stark build his own gadgets if he would now have to defend himself when he would \nconfront\n both Killian and \nMandarin\n. The sudden thought of being independent and focusing on his work snapped Stark out of his panic attack as he drove away towards a gardening store to buy some supplies, \nmacgyvering\n them into makeshift weapons.\n[\n4\n]\nLearning the Truth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark scouts out the \nMandarin\n's mansion\n \n \n\"What are you, a decoy?

Fill it with words.\"\nTony Stark and \nTrevor Slattery\n[src]\nWith all of his new homemade gadgets now ready, Stark prepared to infiltrate the \nMandarin\n's \nhome\n and finally confront and possibly even kill the terrorist in revenge for all of the lives he had endangered, including \nHappy Hogan\n. Taking position outside the walls, Stark used binoculars to spy on the compound, spotting several guards watching the entire area as he planned to get past them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark gets past all of the \nMandarin\ns guards\n \n \nJumping over the wall, Stark \ninfiltrated the mansion\n as quickly as he could. Using all his wits and fighting skills, Stark successfully and swiftly knocked out several of the guards, using his newly-made gadgets to gain the advantage as he fired knockout darts at the guards, and used an electrified glove and homemade grenades to get past them all. Stark eventually made it inside the building, where he continued to search through the rooms for the Mandarin.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark meets and threatens \nTrevor Slattery\n \n \nStark eventually found a large bedroom filled with movie props, along with the \nMandarin\n's wardrobe; there were also signs that someone was living inside, and Stark came upon two half-naked women in the bed. Hearing someone enter from the bathroom, Stark then hid; the Mandarin entered, speaking in a British accent. Stark ambushed him, holding the Mandarin at gunpoint, and was surprised by the sudden cowardly reaction from the terrorist, demanding answers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is found and ambushed by \nEric Savin\n \n \nTo his horror, Stark soon learned that \"the Mandarin\" was nothing more than a character the actor, \nTrevor Slattery\n, had been hired to play; Slattery was given endless amounts of drugs and anything else he desired in return for taking the blame for the explosions. The person who had employed him was \nAldrich Killian\n, who needed to cover up the failures of his \nExtremis\n program. Just then, Stark was knocked unconscious by \nEric Savin\n, who took him hostage.\n[\n4\n]\nAldrich Killian's Hostage\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is questioned by \nMaya Hansen\n \n \n\"What's next for you in your world?\"\n\"Well, I wanted to repay you with the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me: Desperation.\"\nTony Stark and \nAldrich Killian\n[src]\nUpon awakening in captivity at \nAldrich Killian\n's \nmansion\n, Stark was shocked and angered to learn that \nMaya Hansen\n was working for \nA.I.M.\n; she had used the formula he wrote down in a drunken daze after their night together to better stabilize \nExtremis\n but needed money so she joined Killian. Although having forgotten all about that equation, Stark refused to help Hansen better understand it and expressed his disgust over her losing her soul, since he remembered her as a woman who used to have a moral psychology and a sense of right and wrong. Stark tried to appeal to what remained of Hansen's humanity to make her help him escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark's life is threatened by \nAldrich Killian\n \n \nTheir conversation was interrupted when Killian arrived and revealed the reasons behind A.I.M.'s actions, and how he was grateful to Stark for teaching him that he needed to control the chaos from behind the scenes. Killian expressed that since Stark left him behind on the roof in \nSwitzerland\n, it gave him a sense of desperation, which changed his life. Killian went on to discuss \nTrevor Slattery\n's role as the Mandarin, acknowledging his over-the-top personality.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns \nPepper Potts\n is being tortured\n \n \nKillian compared Slattery's Mandarin performance to him creating a terrorist like \nOsama Bin Laden\n or \nMuammar Gaddafi\n to blame his failures on. Expressing his desire for Stark to suffer desperation, Killian revealed he had captured \nPepper Potts\n and was infecting her with Extremis, leaving her in danger of exploding; Stark would be now forced to help improve Extremis in order to save Potts' life, with Killian cruelly noting how much pain she was currently in.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark witnesses Hansen betraying Killian\n \n \nWhile Stark struggled to look at the video feed of the woman he loved suffering, Killian offered to pay him for helping them and began to strangle Stark. Hansen, realizing he had gone too far, demanded Stark's release by threatening to kill herself with an overdose of Extremis and wound Killian in the blast, whilst depriving him of his chief researcher. Stark watched in horror and sadness as Killian murdered her without any remorse. As Killian left Stark to think about his next move, Stark angrily called him a maniac for killing Hansen while Killian claimed to be a \"visionary.\"\n[\n4\n]\nBreak Out\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to intimidate his guards\n \n \n\"Put down your weapons, tie yourselves to those chairs, I'll let you live. In five, four Bang! You should be gone by now. You should have already been gone.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nStark was left guarded by two of \nAldrich Killian\n's henchmen, one of whom broke \nHarley Keener\n's sister's watch. Once he learned the correct time, Stark worked out that his \nsuit\n would be charged by now and offered the henchmen, one of whom he nicknamed \nPonytail Express\n, a chance to escape, believing that it would arrive in seconds; however, this led to an awkward period of Stark awaiting his suit which took considerably longer than he expected to arrive.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark collects parts of his \nMark XVII\n armor\n \n \nThe reason being that the doors to Keener's barn the pieces were being kept in were chained shut, and therefore the rest of the armor was trapped. Summoning his \nMark XLII\n all the way from Keener's home, Stark was given one of his gauntlets, which he used to shoot Ponytail Express and free himself. A boot then attached itself onto Stark's leg to give him the advantage in the fight against his captors, although Stark still questioned where the rest of the armor was.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fights all \nAldrich Killian\n's henchmen\n \n \nHaving escaped captivity, Stark was forced to battle several guards from \nA.I.M.\n, despite only getting a hand and leg part of his suit for the duration of the fight. Stark found that this greatly affected how he could fight, as he struggled to maintain control of flying while wearing only the pieces of armor he had. When one guard grabbed Stark from behind, Stark used the boot's repulsor to launch himself backwards and knock out the guard, stealing his gun in the process.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark allows the final \nA.I.M.\n guard to leave\n \n \nKeener soon freed the rest of the parts of the Mark XLII, knowing that Stark was in need of his armor. Once the guards were all knocked out, Stark prepared to shoot the last one, only to be amused when the man quickly surrendered to him as he claimed to hate working for Killian and A.I.M. The rest of the suit arrived and Stark made his way through the facility. He greeted \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n while seeing the \nIron Patriot Armor\n fly off, with his own suit failing to fly.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nRhodes\n question \nTrevor Slattery\n \n \nTo Stark's surprise, he ran into \nJames Rhodes\n, who he thought was in the armor; it turned out that the Iron Patriot suit was stolen by \nEric Savin\n in order to kidnap President \nMatthew Ellis\n. Needing a way to go after Killian, Stark and Rhodes interrogated \nTrevor Slattery\n, waking him from another drunken stupor. Seeking to save the President, Stark remembered that Slattery had been given a speedboat from Killian and demanded it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nRhodes\n discuss the rescue\n \n \nOnboard Slattery's boat, Stark called Vice President \nRodriguez\n to warn him that President Ellis was about to be attacked by Savin posing as the \nIron Patriot\n, with Rodriguez informing them that Ellis was about to board \nAir Force One\n. After Rodriguez promised to handle the situation, Stark and Rhodes next discussed who they had time to save, \nPepper Potts\n or President Ellis. Stark decided to \nremote control\n his armor so they could save both of them.\n[\n4\n]\nSaving the Air Force One Crew\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nEric Savin\n battle to death\n \n \n\"Eleven more to go.

Fighting Savin, Iron Man's armor was briefly disabled by the man's \nExtremis\n powers, but he soon managed to shoot directly through Savin's chest and kill him, though at the cost of the plane falling apart around him.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man catches the falling passengers\n \n \nTo his horror, Iron Man witnessed all of the passengers onboard being sucked out of the plane through a hole caused by a bomb Savin had planted and now plummeting thousands of feet to the ocean below. With everyone else falling, Iron Man flew out of Air Force One just before it exploded, asking \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n how he could save them all. J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him that the \nMark XLII\n could not carry that many people at the same time.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man saves all of the other passengers\n \n \nWith no time to spare, Iron Man grabbed ahold of \nHeather\n and told her to in turn grab whoever she could reach, explaining that he would send a shockwave through her body so that Heather could not let go of them. Iron Man \nsaved two other passengers\n while diving down to collect the others, quickly running out of time as they fell towards the ocean. Forming a human chain by the passengers grabbing each other, Iron Man dove for the final passenger once everyone was linked.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man successfully saves all the people\n \n \nWith everyone now connected, Iron Man used his thrusters to give them more height before he then safely deposited them in a river. As the people cheered in celebration, Iron Man ensured that they were all okay and complimented the group before turning around to return to the boat and save \nPepper Potts\n. However, when Iron Man was not looking, the armor was knocked apart by an incoming truck, smashing into pieces across the road.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark losing his connection to the \nMark XLII\n \n \nStill back on board the boat, Stark took off his \nMark XLII Telepresence Headset\n and confirmed to \nJames Rhodes\n that he had indeed saved the passengers. As they prepared to move on to find Potts and \nAldrich Killian\n, Stark was then informed by J.A.R.V.I.S. that the rubble had been cleared out from his \nMalibu Mansion\n, finally allowing him to reactivate the \nIron Legion\n.

Sneaking in, they were attacked by several \nExtremis Soldiers\n. Stark fired his gun at the soldiers, but was unable to stop them due to poor aim, which Rhodes mocked him about. Taking out a light from a long distance, Rhodes quickly proved himself to be the superior marksman due to his training in the \nAir Force\n which greatly annoyed Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark calls upon the entire \nIron Legion\n \n \nOutnumbered, Stark summoned the \nIron Legion\n to their aid, all of which were currently being controlled by \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n, except the \nMark XLII\n, which was running late after trying to save the president in \nAir Force One\n. Rhodes looked on in amazement as all the armors flew in together and lined up, awaiting the orders of Stark. Taking delight in his achievements, Stark then wished J.A.R.V.I.S. a Merry Christmas before sending all of the armors into \nbattle\n, ordering them to target the Extremis Soldiers with extreme prejudice. Stark watched the battle unfolding, ordering \nMark XXXVIII\n to hold up the platform under them and \nMark XVII\n to assist \nMark XXXV\n in the fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark dons his new \nMark XXXIII\n armor\n \n \nStark donned the \nMark XXXIII\n suit and prepared to fly into battle, as Rhodes requested his own armor to fight in. Stark, however, revealed that the armors were only coded to himself and therefore, he had to send the Mark XVII to carry Rhodes to find both President Ellis and the \nIron Patriot Armor\n, much to Rhodes' annoyance. Stark then flew across the battlefield in search for \nPepper Potts\n so that he could take her away from the battle towards safety.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to rescue \nPepper Potts\n \n \nWhile his suits continued to fight all of the enhanced soldiers, with several of the armors being torn apart by their Extremis powers, Iron Man eventually found Potts unharmed underneath wreckage from a recent explosion. He mocked her about all of this happening because she spent time with \nMaya Hansen\n, while trying to get her out without risking the structure falling and crushing her. Reaching out, Iron Man and Potts were able to grab each other's hands.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is ambushed by \nAldrich Killian\n \n \nHowever, before Stark could free Potts, \nAldrich Killian\n unexpectedly attacked him and damaged the armor's \nArc Reactor\n. Pinning Iron Man down, Killian began slowly burning through his suit with his finger, taunting that Stark should close his eyes and die. Refusing to give in, however, Stark was forced to cut off Killian's arm with the armor's hidden blade and eject from the suit, only for Killian's still red-hot severed arm to burn through the floor underneath Potts.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark chases closely behind \nPepper Potts\n \n \nSeeing that Potts was trapped and being pulled towards a sheer edge, Stark charged through the battlefield as he demanded that \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n provide him with a new suit. As he ran across the \nNorco\n, Stark failed to get a new armor and was informed that Rhodes had rescued President Ellis and was taking him to safety. With all of the Extremis Soldiers being kept at bay, Stark began catching up with Potts and leaped from one platform to the other to get to her.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sees \nPepper Potts\n' seeming death\n \n \nApproaching as close as he could, Stark was still unable to quite reach Potts and begged her to reach out for him as he stretched as far as he could to try and save her life. However, Stark was then forced to watch in utter horror as a jolt from the platform Potts was on caused her to lose her grip and she fell into a pit of fire 200 feet below to a certain death. Stark looked on with complete heartbreak and devastation as he failed to protect the one person he could not live without.\n[\n4\n]\nShowdown with Aldrich Killian\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man prepares to fight \nAldrich Killian\n \n \n\"Okay, okay!

Infuriated, Stark then ran forward in order to engage in a final fight with Killian. When Killian leaped into the air to strike Stark, he then dived underneath him and donned the \nMark XVI\n armor.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights against \nAldrich Killian\n \n \nEven with his armor on, Stark found out Killian was the superior fighter and the situation was made even worse by his \nExtremis\n abilities, which could penetrate any armor with relative ease. Killian used his red-hot limbs to cut through the metal armor and attempt to kill Iron Man. As their \nduel\n continued, Iron Man did all he could to subdue Killian, but found that the man could withstand and heal from any strike and his strength also surpassed Stark's, even tearing off part of the Armor from Stark's left hand and healing from having his own left hand broken when they clashed their fists. When he was pinned down, Iron Man again exited his suit to avoid Killian's burning fist.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man dons yet another armor in the fight\n \n \nHaving launched himself off the edge of the platform, Iron Man then donned the \nMark XL\n in midair and attacked Killian once again. Iron Man flew Killian across the battlefield but was still unable to tire him out, as all his attempts to stop Killian were met with superhuman combat attacks and his armor was once again cut to pieces by Killian's Extremis powers. Killian almost cut off Iron Man's leg before Stark was finally able to gain the upper hand.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to don the \nMark XLII\n armor\n \n \nIron Man was able to avoid death once again by ejecting out of his suit seconds before Killian ripped it apart with his bare hands, falling hard on his back onto the platform below. Standing alone on the platform, Stark, now armor-less due to the rest of the \nIron Legion\n being preoccupied with his command to destroy all of Killian's \nExtremis Soldiers\n, awaited the arrival of the \nMark XLII\n but was soon deflated when it crashed and disassembled once again.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark traps \nAldrich Killian\n inside his armor\n \n \nAmused at Stark's failed attempt to don another armor to continuing fighting against him, Killian mockingly spoke to Stark about him not deserving Potts and claiming that he was close to making her \"perfect\" in his eyes by experimenting on her with Extremis. Stark agreed that Killian was right and he did not deserve Potts, but retorted that she already was perfect before sending the Mark XLII onto Killian, trapping him with all the thrusters on full power, eventually pinning him against the wall.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attempts to escape the explosions\n \n \nAs Killian yelled out in anger at seemingly being defeated, Stark then ordered \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to activate the armor's self-destruct protocol while he escaped. Diving off the platform, Stark avoided the massive explosion behind him, which seemingly destroyed Killian once and for all. As the fireball continued to grow and destroyed most of the \nNorco\n, Stark summoned the \nMark XV\n to catch him as he jumped to safety, only for the armor to fail on the way down by crashing into the platform, causing Stark to crash-land, barely avoiding all of the flames and the debris that followed him down from the explosion.\n[\n4\n]\nClean Slate Protocol\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark recovers from surviving the battle\n \n \n\"Who's the hot mess now?\"\n\"It's still debatable.

Suddenly, \nAldrich Killian\n emerged from the flames with most of his own skin destroyed seemingly beyond \nExtremis\n' ability of reconstruction and still intent on Stark's death. Stark was now powerless and at the mercy of Killian, who proclaimed himself the \nMandarin\n, saying that he was from the start.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sees \nPepper Potts\n kill \nAldrich Killian\n \n \nDuring this tirade, \nPepper Potts\n, still alive due to the Extremis in her system, struck Killian to the ground with a large metal pipe, to which Stark was left speechless. The \nMark IX\n armor flew downward in an attack position, and Stark failed to tell \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to disengage due to losing his earpiece. Potts then jumped off his knee to impale the suit and don one of its gauntlets. Stark watched as Potts sent Killian flying backwards and threw a missile at him, blowing it up with a repulsor blast.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to reassure \nPepper Potts\n \n \nWith Killian and all the \nExtremis Soldiers\n now dead for good, Stark approached the confused Potts, who took a minute to realize the violence of what she had done while under the influence of Extremis. Stark and Potts teased each other about how he had thought she was dead while she joked about who was the bigger \"hot mess\" now. Stark apologized to Potts and promised to find a cure for her powers, joking that a relationship with him would always be a mess.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark initiates the \nClean Slate Protocol\n \n \nSeeing that Potts was still worried about their future together, Stark decided to give her another early Christmas present and finally ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all his remaining \nIron Legion\n armors in Operation: \nClean Slate Protocol\n. Surrounded by the firework-like explosions in the sky, the couple embraced, with Stark asking if Potts was enjoying the show, which she said she did, as he accepted a life without such an obsession of being Iron Man.\n[\n4\n]\nTemporary Retirement\n[\n]\nA Step Further\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shortly before his heart surgery\n \n \n\"As promised, I got \nPepper\n sorted out.

And now, neither will I.\"\nTony Stark to \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nAs \n2014\n began, Stark was able to use his vast resources to cure \nPepper Potts\n of the \nExtremis\n, removing her superhuman abilities.

Since \nTony Stark's Mansion\n had been destroyed by \nAldrich Killian\n and \nEric Savin\n, Stark and Potts moved in together at \nStark Tower\n, which he had now redesigned and renamed \nAvengers Tower\n ready if he would ever again need to rejoin the \nAvengers\n for a future mission to save the world again.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to begin his next chapter\n \n \nReturning to his home's wreckage, Stark threw his \nArc Reactor\n into the ocean, vowing that he was still Iron Man.

Stark retired from the hero \"business\" for at least a year, but continued to work as a consultant for \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n and run \nStark Industries\n.\n[\n4\n]\n He began helping \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n by making repulsor technology for their three new \nHelicarriers\n, to avoid the issue that happened during the \nAttack on the Helicarrier\n.\n[\n51\n]\nTherapy Session\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sees \nBruce Banner\n is falling asleep\n \n \n\"Where did I lose you?\"\n\"Elevator in \nSwitzerland\n.\"\n\"So, you heard none of it?\"\nTony Stark and \nBruce Banner\n[src]\nIn the wake of his \nbattle\n with \nAldrich Killian\n and all of the stress he had endured from the \nBattle of New York\n aftermath, Stark retold the entire story to \nBruce Banner\n in the \nAvengers Tower\n. Much to Stark's great annoyance, Banner had fallen asleep during the tale, telling his friend that he was not that kind of doctor.

However, they are shot down by HYDRA's forces and, after the Quinjet crashes, they all, with the exception of \nBruce Banner\n, exit the Quinjet to fight. A HYDRA soldier notices there is still an Avenger in the Quinjet and orders it to be fired at, which makes Banner turn into \nHulk\n.

While the other Avengers fought the soldiers on the ground, Iron Man worked on destroying the base's shields to allow the team access. When Iron Man swore during the mission, \nCaptain America\n told him to watch his language, much to Iron Man's amusement. When the people of \nSokovia\n began being targeted by all Strucker's guns, Iron Man ordered \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to send out the \nIron Legion\n in order to get the innocent people back to the safety of their homes.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man breaks into the \nHYDRA\n base\n \n \nIron Man soon managed to disable the shields and entered the base; subduing all of Strucker's soldier's with ease. Once inside, Iron Man killed \nList\n who was attempting to delete his files before making his way through the hallways. Removing the \nMark XLIII\n, Stark scanned the room in order to find a secret hallway, hoping to find all of Strucker and List's secret experiments, while being informed that during the battle \nHawkeye\n had been badly injured.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark's mind is attacked by \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nWhile Captain America had successfully captured Baron Strucker, Stark located inside the base the corpse of a \nLeviathan\n, which HYDRA had stolen after the \nBattle of New York\n, and the \nScepter\n, which had last been seen in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hands having been taken away from \nLoki\n. While Stark was looking at the Scepter and prepared to take it back into the Avengers' custody, \nWanda Maximoff\n snuck up behind him and gave him a vision of the future with her powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is given a vision of the future\n \n \nIn the vision, Stark saw the Avengers lying dead after a \nmysterious battle\n against a \npowerful enemy\n. As Stark explored the battlefield, he saw the deaths of his teammates, with \nCaptain America's Shield\n lying broken in half. Going to \nSteve Rogers\n, Stark was surprised when Rogers grabbed his hand, telling him that Stark could have saved them before dying. Stark looked up and saw the Leviathans and \nChitauri\n heading to \nEarth\n through a portal in space.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finds and recaptures the \nScepter\n \n \nShaken by what he had seen, Maximoff allowed Stark to retrieve the Scepter, knowing its power would ultimately cause his own downfall. Unaware that he was now being watched by Maximoff and her twin brother \nPietro Maximoff\n, Stark reclaimed the Mark XLIII gauntlet and used it to snatch the Scepter away, originally planning on giving it back to \nThor\n to take back to \nAsgard\n to keep the Earth safe from its power, but Stark now had some new ideas about using it.\n[\n5\n]\nCreation of Ultron\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark flies back towards \nAvengers Tower\n \n \n\"I see a suit of armor around the world.\"\n\"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.\"\n\"I've seen colder.

Along the way, Stark asked \nBruce Banner\n if it was okay for Doctor \nHelen Cho\n to set up all of her own equipment in his lab so she could begin the operation to save \nClint Barton\n's life in the wake of his injuries during the battle.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark asks \nThor\n for the use of the \nScepter\n \n \nAs they came closer to their destination, Stark had put \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n in charge of flying while he spoke with \nThor\n and \nCaptain America\n about what was to happen with \nLoki\n's \nScepter\n now that they had finally recovered it from \nHYDRA\n. Stark requested that he be allowed the chance to study the Scepter before Thor returned it to \nAsgard\n to be kept safe, which Thor agreed with before they all discussed having a party to celebrate the capture of Baron Strucker.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark returns to the \nAvengers Tower\n \n \nUpon arriving at \nAvengers Tower\n, Stark was greeted by both Doctor Cho and \nMaria Hill\n, with Stark correcting Hill when she called him boss, claiming that Rogers was the boss despite Stark paying for every they did. While the \nIron Legion\n returned to the tower, Stark checked on Barton's condition while Cho used the \nRegeneration Cradle\n to repair his damaged skin tissue, with Stark teasing Barton that he was dying while Barton insisted that he would now live forever.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nBruce Banner\n discussing \nUltron\n \n \nContinuing his mindset toward protecting humanity while realizing the void that the \ndownfall\n of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n created, Stark created an intelligence with the mandate to ensure global peace at any cost. The intelligence, \nUltron\n, who in turn took control on the \nUltron Sentries\n to defend humanity as a sort of makeshift army and allow the Avengers to retire. Seeking to push the \nUltron Program\n forward, Stark recruited Banner by pitching the Program to him and showing him a detailed breakdown of the \nMind Stone\n inside the Scepter, claiming that they could use its detailed brain waves to give life to Ultron, something they had failed to do in all of their past experiments.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark explains his vision for \nUltron\n's future\n \n \nWhen Banner expressed his doubts about the Ultron Program, Stark argued if they were successful, they could finally retire and Banner may not have to worry about facing \nVeronica\n. Claiming that with Ultron, the next \nChitauri Invasion\n would never happen again, Stark told Banner that he had a vision of a suit of armor around the \nEarth\n, when Banner claimed this sounded like a cold world, Stark said he had seen colder, referring to \nWanda Maximoff\n's vision.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and Banner try to give life into \nUltron\n \n \nWith Banner now on board, he and Stark spent the next three days before it was returned to \nAsgard\n attempted to sync the Mind Stone from the Scepter into the Ultron Program in order to finally give life to Ultron. However, after three days of constant experimentation with the system, Stark and Banner admitted defeat, believing that there was no way for Ultron to be given life. \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n recommended that Stark leave the project and attend to his party guests.\n[\n5\n]\nThe Avengers Party\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark hosts a party for all of the \nAvengers\n \n \n\"Right, so, if I lift \nit\n, I I then rule \nAsgard\n?\"\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\"I will be re-instituting \nprima nocta\n.\"\nTony Stark and \nThor\n[src]\nAt a party hosted at \nAvengers Tower\n, celebrating their recent defeat of \nHYDRA\n and the capture of the \nScepter\n and HYDRA's current leader \nBaron Strucker\n, Stark welcomed not only his own teammates, but also several allies of the team such as \nSam Wilson\n and \nMaria Hill\n, with Doctor \nHelen Cho\n agreeing to attend the party as she had heard that \nThor\n would also be attending. Stark also decided to invite several \nWorld War II\n veterans to the party who spent their time with Thor and \nSteve Rogers\n, drinking ancient \nAsgardian\n alcohol which got one \nattendee\n too drunk to walk.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nThor\n compares their girlfriends\n \n \nWhile drinking with Thor, Stark listened as \nJames Rhodes\n attempted to impress them with stories of how he had secured a tank while in his \nWar Machine Armor\n, with nobody impressed. Stark and Thor then began debating if either \nPepper Potts\n or \nJane Foster\n was the more impressive girlfriend, with Stark noting all of Potts' work with \nStark Industries\n which caused Rhodes to walk away with Hill, leaving Stark and Thor to continue the girlfriend debate alone.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and his \nteammates\n discuss \nMjlnir\n \n \nAs the party went through the night, many of the attendees returned to their home, including Wilson, leaving Stark and the \nAvengers\n along with Hill and Cho as the only remaining non-team members there. As the remaining group joked and drank together around a table, they began to discuss Thor and his power to lift \nMjlnir\n. As the debate went on, \nClint Barton\n decided to try to lift Mjlnir himself, with Stark joking about him not being able to get it up. Stark then stepped up, joking that he wanted to rule \nAsgard\n if he picked it up.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nJames Rhodes\n pull at \nMjlnir\n \n \nStark initially tried to lift it on his own, when that failed he called for the help of \nJames Rhodes\n to no more avail, even with the \nMark XLIII\n gauntlet. All the other Avengers then each decided to have a go at lifting the hammer, with \nBruce Banner\n joking about \nHulking\n out and \nSteve Rogers\n only slightly moved it while \nNatasha Romanoff\n refused it even try.

While Stark tried to get \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to shut down the robot, it introduced itself as \nUltron\n, claiming that it was there for peace in their time. When questioned about its true intentions, Ultron told them it intended to destroy the \nAvengers\n in order to achieve peace as they listened in horror.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark fights against the new \nUltron Sentries\n \n \nUltron then sent out all his \nSentries\n to attack the Avengers. Without his \nMark XLIII\n armor to defend himself, Stark was quickly separated from \nJames Rhodes\n and was forced to use whatever had come to hand to battle the robots.

Refusing to listen to the robot's threats to them any longer, \nThor\n then destroyed Ultron's robot body with \nMjlnir\n, although one of its own Sentries had already escaped with the \nScepter\n in its hand and had claimed that it would attack all of the Avengers again.\n[\n5\n]\nTeam Argument\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark examines the broken \nUltron\n robot\n \n \n\"A \nhostile alien army\n came charging through a \nhole in space\n.

He listened closely as it was soon learned that Ultron had successfully accessed \nAvengers Tower\n's files and escaped through the internet, with \nJames Rhodes\n and \nMaria Hill\n worrying that he may also gain access into the nuclear codes. When it was noted that Ultron had claimed to have killed somebody, Stark revealed that he had learned that Ultron had destroyed \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n' mainframe in a rage.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is confronted by \nThor\n \n \nWhile Stark and \nHelen Cho\n discussed Ultron's possible motives for turning against him, \nThor\n then stormed in and grabbed Stark by the throat, accusing him of bringing destruction onto the \nEarth\n. Thor explained he had lost the \nScepter\n, claiming Ultron was created by Stark messing with something he did not understand.

Stark then recalled the \nBattle of New York\n, claiming that what was out in space would destroy them all if they did not plan ahead. As \nSteve Rogers\n claimed they could beat that threat as a team, Stark claimed that they would fail, with Rogers telling him they would still be a team.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns of \nBaron Strucker\n's death\n \n \nSeeking leads, the team began searching for wherever Ultron was heading next and later learned that Ultron had built himself a new body and had \nmurdered\n \nBaron Strucker\n in his prison cell and had recruited the aid of \nWanda\n and \nPietro Maximoff\n. Upon learning of Baron Strucker's death, it was noted that this was likely a smokescreen to throw them off, with all of their own information on Strucker having been deleted off their computers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark noting on \nUlysses Klaue\n's past history\n \n \nForced to use old \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n files, the team researched anyone who was connected to Strucker who may be able to find a new lead. Stark soon pointed out \nUlysses Klaue\n, noting that he had almost done a deal with him to sell \nStark Industries\n weapons. Stark explained that Klaue was known for having a brand on his neck that marked him as a thief of \nWakanda\n, the land where \nvibranium\n was made, so they all assumed that Ultron would go to him for the metal.\n[\n5\n]\nHunting Ultron\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and the \nAvengers\n engage \nUltron\n \n \n\"Don't compare me with Stark!

Hulk launched a car at Iron Man, knocking him back, so Iron Man responded by flying to Hulk and dragging him face first through the concrete.

As they continued fighting, Iron Man was aware that behind him an elevator filled with people were standing just feet away from the battle as they attempted to escape.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man saves a group of innocent civilians\n \n \nWhen he was kicked back with incredible force, Iron Man crashed into the elevator filled with innocent people, forcing him to catch it before it hit the ground as he ordered everyone to get out while they still could. Iron Man then proceeded to use the elevator as a weapon as he slammed it down onto Hulk's head. Once Hulk was stunned, Iron Man hit him across the face, knocking out one of his teeth, an action which Iron Man then soon regretted.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man manages to knock out \nHulk\n \n \nThe enraged Hulk then proceeded to smash Iron Man across the city, attempting to rip out the \nArc Reactors\n powering the \nMark XLIV\n armor.

Although Stark at first assumed it was a lie as Barton was a \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n spy, Barton explained to them that the reason the team were still unaware of his family was due to Director \nNick Fury\n helping him to have this second peaceful life just outside S.H.I.E.L.D. where his family could be safe.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark has an argument with \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nStark and \nSteve Rogers\n went outside and chopped wood together.

While Stark played darts, being outplayed by \nClint Barton\n, he told the group he would go to NEXUS to find Ultron's new enemy.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discusses \nUltron\n's next possible move\n \n \nWhen \nNatasha Romanoff\n noted she had hoped Fury had more to offer, Fury gave them a speech to inspire them to get up and fight against Ultron, telling them to stand up and fight as a team once again. This led to them discussing Ultron's motives at which point, \nBruce Banner\n then realized that Ultron wanted always to improved his body, so he needed \nHelen Cho\n and her \nRegeneration Cradle\n device to create his \nultimate body\n which he could use to become unbeatable.\n[\n5\n]\nHacking the NEXUS\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark speaks to \nSteve Rogers\n and \nNick Fury\n \n \n\"I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.\"\n\"How do you find it?\"\n\"Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.\"\nTony Stark and World Hub Tech\n[src]\nStark then made it clear to \nSteve Rogers\n that if \nUltron\n succeeded in uploading himself to the \nsynthetic body\n, he might be stronger than any of them. \nNick Fury\n then told them that he will take \nBruce Banner\n to the \nAvengers Tower\n and said to Stark that he needed \nMaria Hill\n. As the Avengers flew to \nSeoul\n, Stark was inside the \nNEXUS Internet Hub\n searching for the person who prevented \nUltron\n from obtaining launch codes for nuclear missiles.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark successfully hacks into the \nNEXUS\n \n \nWhile hacking into the NEXUS to find Ultron's new enemy, Stark was shocked to find out it was \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n, who erased his memory and had scattered himself all across the Internet to block Ultron. It turned out that Ultron was afraid of J.A.R.V.I.S. and of what he could do, so J.A.R.V.I.S. went underground and prevent from Ultron from getting the codes. Restoring J.A.R.V.I.S.'s memory, Stark then sent his own programming back towards Avengers Tower.\n[\n5\n]\nBirth of Vision\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark reveals the survival of \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n \n \n\"So, you want me to help you put \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n into this \nthing\n?\"\n\"No, of course not.

Greeting Stark upon his arrival at the Tower, Barton was with the \nRegeneration Cradle\n with the \nsynthetic body\n inside it. Barton informed Stark that \nUltron\n had also successfully kidnapped \nNatasha Romanoff\n during the \nBattle of Seoul\n, so Barton began his search for her. Stark then told Banner everything he discovered and he asked for his help him upload J.A.R.V.I.S. to the synthetic body.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nBanner\n discuss the \nnew body\n \n \nBanner was against the idea of messing with the body, finding the situation to be a time-loop they were all now stuck inside since first activating the \nUltron Program\n; however, Stark argued that this was the right move and they did not have the time for the decision to be argued by the other \nAvengers\n. Stark was able to convince Banner that the new being Ultron had created could be a benefit by giving it J.A.R.V.I.S. as a core persona, and prevent megalomania.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is confronted by \nCaptain America\n \n \nAs the two were almost finished preparing to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into the Cradle, \nSteve Rogers\n with \nWanda\n and \nPietro Maximoff\n came and ordered him to shut it down. Stark and Banner refused, shocked that Rogers had recruited the Maximoffs as they recalled how Wanda's powers had caused the \nDuel of Johannesburg\n. When Rogers tried to convince them, Stark argued that whatever had already happened was nothing compared to what was still incoming.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempts to fight off \nCaptain America\n \n \nTo try and end the dispute before it got out of hand, \nQuicksilver\n then responded by speeding around the Cradle and unplugging all of the cables, until he was then subdued by \nHawkeye\n's quick thinking. This action then led to a brief clash between the group, with Stark calling on parts of his \nMark XLIII\n armor and shooting at Rogers, who in turn threw \nhis shield\n at Stark, while Banner and Wanda Maximoff had a brief fight in which she knocked him back with her powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark witnesses the birth of \nVision\n \n \nJust as their fight was getting underway, \nThor\n had suddenly charged straight into \nAvengers Tower\n and revived the synthetic body with a massive bolt of his lightning as Stark and the others looked on in shock and horror. The living body then jumped out of the Cradle and looked around its surroundings while the group looked on. The being then briefly attacked Thor until he looked out over \nNew York City\n and calmed down as the Avengers moved down to speak to it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens closely to \nVision\n's speech\n \n \nThe living body apologized and called itself \nVision\n and claimed to wish to assist them in their fight against \nUltron\n. Thor explained that while in the \nWater of Sight\n he had seen Vision in his dream and the \nMind Stone\n, one of the six \nInfinity Stones\n, that is in Vision's forehead. At first, the team did not trust Vision's motives, but as proof of his honor, Vision handed Thor \nMjlnir\n. A shocked Stark was congratulated by Thor for creating a new worthy ally.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nVision\n agree \nUltron\n's hatred\n \n \nHaving successfully tracked down Ultron to \nSokovia\n where he was planning on using \nBaron Strucker\n's former base to begin his schemes, Stark and the other Avengers got themselves prepared for what could be possibly their \nfinal battle\n. As Stark was talking with Rogers and Banner, he noted that if any of the \nUltron Sentries\n got away, then they had lost. When Stark noted Ultron was waiting for him, Vision confirmed that Ultron hated Stark most of all.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens to \nCaptain America\n's speech\n \n \nGetting on board the \nQuinjet\n in order to fly to Sokovia and confront Ultron for the final time, Stark and the other Avengers listened as \nCaptain America\n gave a speech in which he told the team that their priority would be to get the people of \nNovi Grad\n to safety before fighting Ultron's army. Looking at Stark, Rogers noted that Ultron believed the Avengers were what was wrong with the world, and this was their chance to prove that he was wrong.\n[\n5\n]\nBattle of Sokovia\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man arrives in \nSokovia\n to face \nUltron\n \n \n\"Come to confess your sins?\"\n\"I don't know, how much time you got?\"\n\"More than you.\"\n\nUltron\n and Iron Man\n[src]\nThe \nAvengers\n had eventually tracked \nUltron\n down in \nSokovia\n, where he had taken \nNatasha Romanoff\n to be held in a secret cell. Before leaving, Stark first installed a new AI, \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, into his \nnewest suit\n as he no longer had \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to assist him. As the rest of the Avengers helped to evacuate the civilians out of \nNovi Grad\n and \nBruce Banner\n went to free Romanoff from her cell, Iron Man confronted Ultron in the city's church right in the center of Sokovia.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is found and confronted by \nUltron\n \n \nUltron revealed himself to Iron Man, showing that he had created a new near indestructible body for himself made from the \nvibranium\n he had stolen from \nUlysses Klaue\n, and a drill that had emerged from the center of the church which dug deep underground, also revealing a vibranium detonator with a mechanism located underground. As the machine was activated, Iron Man went to understand how to stop it while \nVision\n then came to confront Ultron himself.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man flies above the rising \nNovi Grad\n \n \nAs Vision succeeded to disconnect Ultron from the internet. Ultron activated the drill and a part from the city flew to the sky. F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed Stark that if the city would get high enough, the impact of its fall to the ground would cause a global extinction. While all the Avengers \nfought against\n the \nUltron Sentries\n and made sure that the civilians were safe, Stark and F.R.I.D.A.Y. debated about a way to make sure the city would not be able to hit the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man saves a family during the battle\n \n \nWhile flying around the still rising Novi Grad, Iron Man witnesses one building falling off the edge of the drop, with \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n informing him that there were still people trapped inside. Without a moment to spare, Iron Man flew into the building to find a terrified family, so he ordered them to get into the bathtub as he flew them down to the ground to safety. Iron Man warned \nCaptain America\n of more Sentries heading his way, although Rogers was hit regardless.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man flies into battle with \nWar Machine\n \n \nEventually through lots of planning with F.R.I.D.A.Y., Iron Man came to the idea that he and \nThor\n can destroy the entire city in the air by attacking it from the top and the bottom. With it seeming there was no hope of saving all of the civilians, \nNick Fury\n and \nMaria Hill\n arrived with a new \nHelicarrier\n and a fleet of \nLifeboats\n, helping all of the Avengers with evacuating \nNovi Grad\n while \nWar Machine\n helped with the battle as he and Iron Man fought the Sentries together.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man saves a falling \nLifeboat\n \n \nAs Iron Man did all that he could to keep the Lifeboats filling with civilians safe, he continued discussing how to destroy Ultron's core, coming out with a plan to supercharge the inside from below. When one Lifeboat was damaged, Iron Man flew up and pushed it the rest of the way to the Helicarrier. Iron Man was informed by \nThor\n that Ultron was now heading towards the core so Iron Man called on the \nAvengers\n to come together and stop him from activating it.\n[\n5\n]\nProtecting the Drill\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights against the \nUltron Sentries\n \n \n\"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that \ncarrier\n.\"\n\"On it.\"\n\"\nAvengers\n time to work for a living.\"\nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n[src]\nThe \nAvengers\n came together to guard the \nvibranium\n drill in order to keep the \nUltron Sentries\n from activating it to prevent the city from falling. As they prepared for the battle and destroyed the nearby Sentries, Iron Man mocked \nBlack Widow\n for taking too long to arrive and joked she was messing about with \nBruce Banner\n, while she noted that not every member of their team could fly.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man prepares for the last stand\n \n \nWith all the Avengers assembled around the core, Iron Man looked on as \nUltron\n gathered his army of Sentries, with \nThor\n challenging his might by questioning if this was the best he could do. Having shown off his entire army, Ultron questioned how they possibly hoped to stop him, with Iron Man then quoting back \nCaptain America\n's earlier words by telling Ultron that they would do it together, which caused Ultron to send in his hordes of Ultron Sentries.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man destroys all of the \nUltron Sentries\n \n \nAs the army of \nUltron Sentries\n charged into the church in an attempt to rip the Avengers apart and activate the key, Iron Man and the rest of the team used all of their might to \nfight back\n against the hordes of robots. As Iron Man flew around the church in his \nMark XLV\n army, he assisted \nWanda Maximoff\n and all of the other Avengers by shooting the Sentries, cutting down their numbers swiftly. Using teamwork, the Avengers soon began defeating the entire Ultron army.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man destroys \nUltron\n's body armor\n \n \nSeeing the he was losing the battle, Ultron attempted to get involved himself in order to regain control, attacking \nVision\n; however, he was soon knocked back out of the church when Vision used the power of the \nMind Stone\n to push him down. Seeing this, Iron Man and Thor joined in, using the armor beams and \nMjlnir\n's lightning to destroy Ultron's \nvibranium\n armor before \nHulk\n then smashed him across the city and scared off the remaining Sentries.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man successfully destroys \nNovi Grad\n \n \nWith Ultron seemingly defeated, Iron Man ensured that the civilians were evacuated onto the \nHelicarrier\n while he went under the rock to overload the core. However, while Iron Man was cutting through the metal, \nQuicksilver\n was killed by Ultron before one sentry caused the city to fall. Iron Man and \nThor\n succeeded in exploding up \nSokovia\n before it hit the ground. The \nUltron Offensive\n was then ended when the final Ultron Sentry was then destroyed by Vision.\n[\n5\n]\nLeaving the Avengers\n[\n]\nSaying His Goodbyes\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark drives to the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"I will miss you, Tony.\"\n\"Yeah?

Stark met with \nSteve Rogers\n and \nThor\n at the facility where they all discussed \nVision\n keeping the \nMind Stone\n inside his head; Thor insisted that he could as he had proven himself worthy by managing to lift \nMjlnir\n, although Rogers questioned if this counted as Vision was a machine. Thor informed the pair that he intended to return to \nAsgard\n to learn more about the \nInfinity Stones\n and \nwho\n had been recently manipulating them into locating the stones.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark says goodbye to \nCaptain America\n \n \nAs he bade farewell to Rogers, Stark mentioned that perhaps he would build \nPepper Potts\n a house in the country like \nClint Barton\n did and told Rogers that one day he too would retire before driving off.\n[\n5\n]\n Later, Stark was asked by the media about the \nHulk incident\n, to which he responded that public concerns about \nBruce Banner\n were \"baseless\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n[\n55\n]\n Because of his activities as Iron Man, Stark and Potts took a break from their relationship while Stark continued his own work.\n[\n6\n]\nInvestigating Spider-Man\n[\n]\nThrough \nYouTube\n, Stark soon became aware of the existence of a masked superhero in \nNew York City\n named \nSpider-Man\n, who was strong enough to catch a speeding vehicle with his bare hands. Impressed, Stark noted that Spider-Man's strength was stronger than some of the Avengers and began looking into him. He then discovered that he was a fourteen-year-old student named \nPeter Parker\n who resided in Queens, and that he had gained his abilities after being bit a spider. Stark was further impressed after discovering that Parker had created his \nSynthetic Webbing\n and \nWeb-Shooters\n on his own using over-the-counter materials, and wondered what Parker could do if he had access to the resources the Avengers had. As a result, Stark considered Spider-Man as a candidate for a potential future Avenger, and created an \nupgraded suit\n for him.\n[\n20\n]\nFacing the Consequences\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark gives his lecture to \nMIT\n students\n \n \n\"That was nice, what you did for those young people.\"\n\"Oh, they deserve it. Plus, it helps to ease my conscience.\"\n\nMiriam Sharpe\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nIn \n2016\n, Stark presented a guest lecture at his alma mater, \nMIT\n, where demonstrated the students B.A.R.F. as being his invention, which aimed to recreate and relive traumatic memories to help with regret. The demonstration of the technology included Stark's last meeting with his \nmother\n and \nfather\n. Then he followed with a speech where he introduced the \nSeptember Foundation\n grant and announced that every student had been made an equal recipient of it, giving them all the proper funding to move forward with their own inventions and ideas.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark bidding farewell to the \nMIT\n students\n \n \nHe then read from the teleprompter and was shocked to read that he should be presenting \nPepper Potts\n to the stage. Seeing this made Stark briefly pause as he and Potts had broken up due to his own previous commitments to the \nAvengers\n and obsession with building new \nIron Man Armors\n. Stark then said his final words before stepping off stage where the MIT Liaison then attempted to get some money from Stark Industries for the school's funding.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is confronted by \nMiriam Sharpe\n \n \nAs he walked outside, he encountered a \nwoman\n who complimented his funding. She reached to her purse and Stark, thinking she was about to pull a gun, grabbed her hand. But instead, she pulled a photo of her \nson\n and told him that he had been killed during the \nBattle of Sokovia\n. She then told Stark her son's name and that she did not actually blame \nUltron\n for her son's death, but blamed Stark and the Avengers instead; which deeply unnerved him.\n[\n6\n]\nAvengers Civil War\n[\n]\nSokovia Accords\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens to \nThaddeus Ross\n' speech\n \n \n\"\nWe\n need to be put in check.

Stark, haunted by the massive damage he had caused by creating \nUltron\n, agreed to sign the Accords. One month after the \nIncident on Lagos\n involving \nCrossbones\n, both Stark and Ross went to the \nAvengers Compound\n, where he tried to convince the Avengers to sign the Accords.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark checks on \nSteve Rogers\n' reaction\n \n \nThe following month, the Avengers were briefed on the Accords by Ross, who explained that the Accords were created as a result of the catastrophic events in which they were involved, including the \nBattle of New York\n and the \nBattle of Sokovia\n, with Ross presenting them with both the number of casualties caused and the expense of the damages. While the presentation was stopped for upsetting \nWanda Maximoff\n, Ross told them the Accords would be signed in just a few days.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens to all the \nAvengers\n arguments\n \n \nWith Ross gone, the Avengers moved into another room to read and debate the Accords, with \nSam Wilson\n and \nJames Rhodes\n almost immediately clashing on their different views. \nVision\n then noted that perhaps their own existence had caused the conflicts they were fighting. As all the Avengers debated whether to sign it or not, Stark remained silent, with \nSteve Rogers\n realizing that Stark had already chosen his own side, which was to be pro-Accords.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark argues for signing the \nAccords\n \n \nStark gave them the story of \nCharlie Spencer\n and how he had been killed in \nSokovia\n. He pointed out that the group needed to be put in check or they were no better than the bad guys, while also pointing out his role in Ultron's creation. However, Rogers saw the Accords as a block to keep the Avengers from where they needed to be, while Stark noted that if they did not decide to make this decision themselves, it would be done to them soon with far graver consequences for all of them.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark being surprised by \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \nStark and Rogers both argued with each other and then Stark even got surprising support from \nNatasha Romanoff\n, who had previously expressed her disdain for this kind of government oversight in the wake of the \nHYDRA Uprising\n and the \nBattle at the Triskelion\n. Their argument ended when Rogers left the room upon hearing news that \nPeggy Carter\n had died in her sleep, while Stark remained unchanged in his opinion that signing was the right decision.\n[\n6\n]\nFighting with a Friend\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark gives an update to \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \n\"I'm glad \nHoward\n got married.

God, I hated you.\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nSeeking to continue supporting the \nSokovia Accords\n, Stark went into the \nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre\n where he assisted with the fallout from the \nBombing of the Vienna International Centre\n. When Stark was informed that \nCaptain America\n and \nFalcon\n had tried and failed to save the \nWinter Soldier\n from being arrested, Stark greeted them both upon their arrival, noting that Secretary \nThaddeus Ross\n wanted them both prosecuted for their all of actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark debates with \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nHaving also asked \nVision\n to keep \nWanda Maximoff\n inside the \nAvengers Compound\n in order to protect her, in the wake of her \naccident\n in \nLagos\n had resulted in her US Visa being removed. Sitting down with \nSteve Rogers\n, where he once again attempted to convince him to sign the Sokovia Accords. Presenting \nHoward Stark\n's pens which had been used by \nFranklin D. Roosevelt\n to sign the \nLend-Lease\n bill, hoping this could help to change Rogers' mindset on the Accords. When Rogers asked about \nPepper Potts\n, Stark revealed that now they were taking a break from their relationship, with Rogers then apologizing for bringing it up as he did not know.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark makes his argument for the \nAccords\n \n \nAs Stark noted how after \nAldrich Killian's False Flag Attacks\n he had destroyed the \nIron Legion\n for Potts, but since then he had armored up again and again to stop \nHYDRA\n and \nUltron\n, admitting that Ultron was his own doing and that he did not want to stop being Iron Man, and he had hoped signing the Accords could win Potts back. They then briefly discussed his own father's relationship to \nhis mother\n before Rogers admitted he could not ignore bad situations from happening.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is again turned down by \nSteve Rogers\n \n \nBegging Rogers to sign, Stark promised that \nBucky Barnes\n would not be sent to a \nWakandan\n prison. As Rogers seemed to consider signing, they discussed adding safeguards to the Accords. However, when Stark noted that Maximoff was locked up, Rogers confronted him about locking up a child, something Rogers saw akin to \nJapanese\n Internment during \nWorld War II\n, with Stark insisting that he was just doing what needed to be done for the \nAvengers\n, until Rogers walked out.\n[\n6\n]\nWinter Soldier's Escape\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark goes to hunt down the \nWinter Soldier\n \n \n\"Please tell me you brought a suit.\"\n\"Sure did.

During the questioning, however, a power failure occurred and Barnes \nfreed himself\n and tried to escape. While \nEverett Ross\n tried to sort out their situation, Stark contacted \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n and went to confront Barnes himself without his \nIron Man Armor\n to defend himself with from the furious Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is attacked by the \nWinter Soldier\n \n \nStark engaged Barnes, backed up by \nNatasha Romanoff\n and \nSharon Carter\n. Stark used his \ngauntlet\n to fight him by first firing flash beam towards the \nWinter Soldier\n which briefly blinded him before blocking a gunshot with the gauntlet and then ripping the gun apart: However, Barnes managed to overpower him. Barnes escaped, but Stark knew Barnes was most likely still with \nSteve Rogers\n, who, along with \nSam Wilson\n, had also managed to escape from their custody.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark is confronted by \nThaddeus Ross\n \n \nWhile the base recovered from Winter Soldier's \nescape\n, Stark was greeted by Secretary \nThaddeus Ross\n who informed him that due to his involvement in helping their target escape, a special force unit would deal with Rogers. Stark, however, convinced Ross to let him bring them in, promising to wear the \nMark XLVI\n to bring him in, which Ross accepted. As he left the base, Ross gave Stark thirty-six hours before lethal force would be utilized.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark decides to call in \nSpider-Man\n for help\n \n \nAs Stark considered what to do, Romanoff reminded him that they were understaffed, with Stark questioning if she knew where \nHulk\n was, despite Romanoff noting that \nBruce Banner\n would not be on their side. Thinking of possible allies, Stark informed Romanoff that he knew of someone, and as Romanoff approached \nT'Challa\n to ask for his help, Stark flew to \nNew York City\n to recruit \nSpider-Man\n.\n[\n6\n]\nRecruiting Peter Parker\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark has tea with \nPeter Parker\n's \nAunt May\n \n \n\"Better tell \nAunt Hottie\n I'm taking you on a field trip.\"\n\"Don't tell Aunt May.\"\n\"All right, Spider-Man.\"\nTony Stark and \nPeter Parker\n[src]\nHaving deduced Spider-Man's true identity as \nPeter Parker\n, Stark decided to pay him a visit at home.

As Parker returned, Stark persuaded him to trick his aunt into thinking that Parker had applied for Stark's \nscholarship\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shows Parker footage of \nSpider-Man\n \n \nStark entered his room with Parker and was soon impressed by how Parker used the technology he had retrieved from the trash to build himself computers and other technology. When Parker attempted to explain that he had not applied for the grant, Stark stopped him before he then showed Parker videos of him as Spider-Man saving civilians, complimenting him on his powers as they watched footage of him stopping a car with his bare hands; stating that the car was three thousand pounds and going forty miles per hour when Parker stopped it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discusses \nPeter Parker\n's equipment\n \n \nParker denied that the person in the video was him, claiming it was edited footage, but Stark quickly found his \nSpider-Man Suit\n and equipment, forcing him to admit the truth. Stark asked him if anyone knew who he was, to which Parker informed him that nobody else knew. Stark then complimented Parker on his \nWeb-Shooters\n and was surprised to learn that Parker had built the webbing himself before Stark joked about Parker's suit and told him he needed an upgrade.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark recruits \nSpider-Man\n to his team\n \n \nStark questioned why Parker became Spider-Man, being told that he only wanted to use his powers for the benefit of the people, noting that he believed that if he did not do the right thing with his powers, then \ngood people\n would get hurt as a result, which Stark understood completely.

Iron Man noted that Barnes was responsible for the \nBombing of the Vienna International Centre\n which had killed \nT'Chaka\n and many others, and therefore needed to face justice, while Rogers claimed that Zemo was planning on unleashing more of the \nWinter Soldiers\n. Stark soon found that their negotiation was going nowhere.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark gives his new orders to \nSpider-Man\n \n \nAs a result, Stark called in \nSpider-Man\n to steal \nCaptain America's Shield\n and to tie Rogers' hands using his \nWeb-Shooters\n. Much to Iron Man's annoyance, Spider-Man was more concerned about meeting his hero, \nCaptain America\n, and therefore acting immaturely during the encounter, forcing Iron Man to tell him to calm down. With Rogers now trapped, Iron Man ordering him to listen to his views on the \nSokovia Accords\n, but Rogers remained uncompromising.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shoots at \nHawkeye\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nBefore they could take in Rogers, \nHawkeye\n used an \narrow\n to free him before \nAnt-Man\n returned the shield to Captain America. As the Mark XLVI's sensors then detected the rest of the renegades making their way towards the \nQuinjet\n, Iron Man flew off to confront Hawkeye and \nWanda Maximoff\n, telling \nWar Machine\n to take on Captain America before ordering Spider-Man to keep his distance and web up his foes from afar. Iron Man quickly caught up with Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, managing to block their path with missile strikes.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man traps \nHawkeye\n and \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nWith his two former allies now seemingly trapped, Iron Man began joking that Scarlet Witch had hurt \nVision\n's feeling as she \nescaped\n from the \nAvengers Compound\n, with Scarlet Witch expressing her disgust at being locked away while Iron Man claimed it was for her own protection after the \nLagos Catastrophe\n. Iron Man then casually greeted Hawkeye and asking about what he had been up to during his retirement from the \nAvengers\n, asking if he played golf.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is trapped by \nWanda Maximoff\n \n \nAs they were talking, Hawkeye then deliberately fired \nan arrow\n to miss Iron Man, which he shot out of the sky and joked that Hawkeye had finally missed a shot. Hawkeye, however, then revealed that this was a deception as it had now left Iron Man open to being pinned under several cars by Scarlet Witch. With Iron Man now trapped underneath all of the crashed cars, \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n alerted him he was in danger which Iron Man noted he was already aware of.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man helps \nBlack Widow\n onto her feet\n \n \nFreeing himself, Iron Man helped \nBlack Widow\n up after she, \nBlack Panther\n, and War Machine had nearly been killed by Captain America and Ant-Man using the \nPym Particle Discs\n to throw a truck at them. Seeing the single mindedness that was driving Rogers, Iron Man was left with no choice but to call in his trump card: \nVision\n to come into the \nbattle\n and give them the advantage they needed to finally bring all of Captain America's team members into their custody.\n[\n6\n]\nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man leads his own \nAvengers\n team\n \n \n\"Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestions.\"\nIron Man\n[src]\nEventually, \nVision\n fired a powerful burst from the \nMind Stone\n to attempt to cow \nCaptain America\n into submission before offering him a final chance to surrender. Regrouping his team, Iron Man stood across from Captain America's team to try and force his ally to stand down. However, Captain America refused again, forcing Iron Man to order his team into \nbattle\n with the directive to capture their renegade teammates alive.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attacks \nCaptain America\n \n \nIron Man engaged Captain America in one-on-one melee combat before \nHawkeye\n fired an \nexplosive arrow\n towards the \nMark XLVI\n to no effect other than knocking him back. As the \nAvengers\n all fought each other across the airport, Iron Man later chose to attack \nFalcon\n in a midair battle, before Hawkeye fired a volley of arrows towards Iron Man. The Mark XLVI's systems were able to easily trace the path of the arrows and then destroy them all one by one.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man's armor is hacked by \nAnt-Man\n \n \nAs Iron Man prepared to take down Hawkeye with a carefully aimed shot, the left repulsor failed. Demanding an update from \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, she tracked the problem to \nAnt-Man\n having entered the suit and was disabling it from the inside, teasing him that the voice he could hear was his conscience. Iron Man and Ant-Man continued to mock each other before, getting fed up, F.R.I.D.A.Y. ejected him via the usage of fire-retardant foam sending him falling back to the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man has a skirmish with \nFalcon\n \n \nWhen it became clear Iron Man's team would win the battle, Ant-Man inverted his powers and grew to sixty feet in height, turning himself into \nGiant-Man\n. Iron Man looked on in amazement as Giant-Man grabbed \nWar Machine\n out of the sky. As Iron Man ordered Giant-Man to free War Machine, he was then attacked by \nFalcon\n, who fired the \nRedwing\n drone to stun Iron Man in midair. While the drone threw off Iron Man's flight plan, it shattered apart against the armor.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nWar Machine\n hit \nGiant-Man\n \n \nWorking with War Machine and \nSpider-Man\n, the three attempted to find a way to stop Giant-Man while he helped \nCaptain America\n and \nBucky Barnes\n to get away. Spider-Man soon came up with an idea to manage to recreate a moment from \nThe Empire Strikes Back\n, calling it a really old movie which caused War Machine to question Iron Man on how old Spider-Man really was. While Spider-Man used his \nWeb-Shooters\n to tie up Giant-Man's legs, Iron Man and War Machine flew up and hit him hard in the chin.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man checks on \nSpider-Man\n's condition\n \n \nWhile they succeeded with knocking down the giant Ant-Man, as he fell, Ant-Man had managed to knock Spider-Man out of the air and onto the concrete from a great height prompting Iron Man to fly down to check on him. When he was satisfied with Spider-Man's state, he decided it was time to send him back to \nNew York City\n threatening to call his \nAunt May\n if the enhanced youth did not listen to him. Despite protesting, Spider-Man soon collapsed from exhaustion.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man chases down \nCaptain America\n \n \nIron Man flew off to chase after the now hijacked \nQuinjet\n containing Captain America and Barnes, who had managed to get away with the assistance of \nBlack Widow\n who had subdued \nBlack Panther\n from them. Iron Man was backed up by War Machine in his pursuit before Falcon began following them. Rhodes ordered Vision to destroy Falcon's flight gear with the Mind Stone, but the android miscalculated and shot out War Machine's \nArc Reactor\n, taking the power out of the suit in hundreds of feet above the ground.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man barely fails to save \nWar Machine\n \n \nAs War Machine fell towards the ground, Iron Man changed direction and tried to save his friend but was just unable to catch him in time before he crashed. He immediately ordered \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to scan for life signs and she contacted emergency medical personnel when she found War Machine was still alive, but was left paralyzed. Falcon also landed and told Iron Man he was sorry, but Iron Man vented his rage by blasting him with a repulsor beam, decisively ending the extended fight.\n[\n6\n]\nClash Aftermath\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark questions \nVision\n about his mistake\n \n \n\"It must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.\"\n\"Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?\"\nTony Stark and \nNatasha Romanoff\n[src]\nWith the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n over, Stark arrived at the \nColumbia University Medical Center\n, checking on \nJames Rhodes\n' current state as his body was X-Rayed. Stark then questioned exactly how \nVision\n could make a mistake like that and Vision admitted he had been distracted by \nWanda Maximoff\n, which neither he nor Stark had known could happen.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark confronts \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \nStark then stepped outside of the operating room when he was then approached by \nNatasha Romanoff\n, to whom he then explained Rhodes' condition before he told her that he was disappointed she allowed \nSteve Rogers\n and the \nWinter Soldier\n to escape, inadvertently leading to Rhodes' accident. Although Romanoff insisted that they had made all of the wrong actions in trying to resolve their situation, Stark insults her by calling her a double agent for assisting Rogers. Natasha, in turn, calls him over for letting his ego get the best of him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discusses with \nNatasha Romanoff\n \n \nStark gives her a half-hearted warning by telling her that \nT'Challa\n had informed \nThaddeus Ross\n about her betrayal and that the government and the \nJoint Counter Terrorist Centre\n would likely come to arrest her. When she insisted they went about this wrong, he then commented that betraying people was something Romanoff seemed unable to help. Stark then watched as she fled the facility to go underground, showing that he was losing faith in all of his former teammates.\n[\n6\n]\nThe Raft\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discovers \nHelmut Zemo\n's schemes\n \n \n\"Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.\"\n\"That's a first.\"\n\"\nCap\n is definitely off the reservation and he's about to need all the help he can get.\"\nTony Stark and \nSam Wilson\n[src]\nIn order to find \nSteve Rogers\n, Stark went to visit the \nRaft\n, where his teammates were imprisoned. On his way to the prison, \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n informed Stark that the \ntherapist\n who was supposed to do \nBucky Barnes\n' psychological evaluation, had been killed by \nHelmut Zemo\n from \nSokovia\n. She told him that Zemo had framed Barnes for the \nterrorist attacks\n as Stark realized that he had been wrong all along.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark meets \nThaddeus Ross\n inside the \nRaft\n \n \nUpon arriving at the Raft, \nThaddeus Ross\n greeted Stark who tried to immediately organize the hunt for Zemo in order to bring him to justice; however, Ross noted that in the wake of the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n he would not be taking orders from Stark, claiming that Stark was lucky not to be arrested himself. Although Ross did not believe Stark, he allowed him to speak to the prisoners, with Stark being noticeably disturbed at how \nWanda Maximoff\n's powers were being kept under control.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark confronts \nClint Barton\n in his cell\n \n \nAs Stark walked through the cell block, \nClint Barton\n got to his feet and expressed the fact that he was enraged at Stark's supposed betrayal of his former \nAvengers\n teammates. Stark argued that he did not know that Barton would end up there, with Barton noted the place was for criminals, which Stark had made them all. Stark argued that Barton had walked away from \nhis wife\n and \nchildren\n to break the law, accusing Barton of choosing the wrong side to fight for.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark walks away from \nClint Barton\n's insults\n \n \nAs Stark walked away, Barton slammed his hands against his cell wall and accused him of being willing to break their backs, referring \nJames Rhodes\n' injures during the recent fight. Stark then walked past \nScott Lang\n, who said \nHank Pym\n was right not to trust the Starks, due to his relationship with \nHoward Stark\n. Stark, however, calmly asked him who he is as he walked past, much to Lang's disappointment.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark makes a secret deal with \nSam Wilson\n \n \nAs he approached \nSam Wilson\n, who asked about Rhodes' condition, Stark asked him to tell him where \nSteve Rogers\n had gone. Wilson did not want to do it, but Stark admitted that since learning about Zemo he knew that he was wrong not to listen earlier and that he wanted to help Rogers. Stark knocked out the audio feed, so Wilson then told him that Rogers was heading for the \na HYDRA base\n in \nSiberia\n, telling Stark to go alone to assist Rogers in stopping Zemo.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark lies to \nThaddeus Ross\n as he leaves\n \n \nKnowing Ross would be of no aid with the hunt for Zemo due to his desire to bring the \nWinter Soldier\n in custody for his believed part in \nT'Chaka\n and many other deaths, Stark decided to withhold the information. As Stark made his way towards his helicopter, Ross questioned if Wilson had given him intel about where Rogers was, but Stark denied it and promised not to answer all Ross' calls if he contacted the \nAvengers Compound\n while he departed.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man flies away towards \nSiberia\n \n \nWhile onboard his own helicopter, Stark then considered how he now would approach Rogers in the wake of everything that had happened before he donned the \nMark XLVI\n in his helicopter and flew to \nSiberia\n, using the rain to cover his movements in the hope that Ross would not follow him and arrest Rogers. However, Iron Man was unaware that \nBlack Panther\n was actually following behind him while onboard his own \nJet\n to find and kill Barnes once and for all.\n[\n6\n]\nHelmut Zemo's Secret\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finds \nSteve Rogers\n and \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"Did you know?\"\n\"I didn't know it was \nhim\n.\"\n\"Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIron Man and \nCaptain America\n[src]\nEntering the \nHYDRA Siberian Facility\n, Iron Man pulled open the doors and saw \nCaptain America\n and \nBucky Barnes\n were waiting for him, ready with their defenses. Greeting the pair, Stark noted that Rogers seemed defensive, with Rogers noting it had been a long day, before Stark told Barnes that he was not currently targeting him because he had decided to listen to Rogers' points.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark makes peace with \nCaptain America\n \n \nNoting that \nThaddeus Ross\n did not know that he was there, and he wanted to keep it that way as he was currently violating the \nSokovia Accords\n by even talking with Rogers without Ross' approval. Stark agreed to put aside the arrest warrant for the two to help them find \nHelmut Zemo\n before he could unleash the \nWinter Soldiers\n, with Stark calling Barnes the \nManchurian Candidate\n and asking him to put down his weapon as he promised they would not fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man searches around for \nHelmut Zemo\n \n \nUpon reaching the main room, however, all the \nMark XLVI\n's thermal scanners revealed that Zemo had killed the Soldiers instead before the man revealed himself within a bunker where he explained that he had successfully managed to bring Stark to the base, after a year of planning. Rogers realized that Zemo was from \nSokovia\n and wanted revenge for the \nBattle of Sokovia\n. Blaming the \nAvengers\n for the loss of his family, he had orchestrated a plot to tear them apart.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark watches his own parents' murders\n \n \nZemo then played the video footage of the night that Stark's parents died, revealing that \nHYDRA\n used the \nWinter Soldier\n to assassinate them in order to steal the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n inside their car trunk. Stark watched in complete horror as the footage showed Winter Soldier brutally killing \nHoward Stark\n by using his \nProsthetic Arm\n to crack his skull as well as strangling \nMaria Stark\n before shooting the camera that had captured their deaths.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns \nRogers\n withheld the truth\n \n \nHaving finally learned the truth of what happened to his parents, Stark processed everything that he had just been shown before he then demanded Rogers to tell him if he had known that Barnes had \nkilled\n his parents. Rogers responded that he had known their deaths had been ordered by \nHYDRA\n, but was unaware that Barnes had been the killer. Stark instantly saw through the lie and demanded the truth, forcing Rogers to reveal that he had known it had been Barnes for years, but hid that fact. Horrified that his friend and fellow \nAvenger\n had been lying to him for years, Stark took a step back to consider his next actions in response to this news.\n[\n6\n]\nFinal Clash with Captain America\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man furiously attacking \nBucky Barnes\n \n \n\"This isn't gonna change \nwhat happened\n.\"\n\"I don't care. \nHe\n killed my \nmom\n.\"\n\nCaptain America\n and Iron Man\n[src]\nAlready enraged by the fallout of \nCaptain America\n' questionable and biased actions over the past few days, Iron Man snaps and attacked \nBucky Barnes\n to avenge his parents. Iron Man struck Captain America in the face and shot the gun out of Barnes' hand before flying him across the facility and pinning him down by forcing his foot against his arm and aiming his blaster shot at his skull.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to subdue \nCaptain America\n \n \nWhile they fought, \nHelmut Zemo\n made his escape from the facility. Iron Man attempted to shoot Barnes point blank in the face, but \nCaptain America\n ran to his aid and threw his \nshield\n at his to deflect the attack before he attempted to push Iron Man off Barnes. Acknowledging their friendship, Iron Man tried to force Rogers out of the fight using the leg clamps which Rogers soon broke free of. Iron Man grabbed Barnes and flew him into the wall.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man's shot is deflected by \nBarnes\n \n \nBarnes managed to use his \nprosthetic arm\n to damage Iron Man's repulsor beam in his hand by crushing it. In response, Iron Man aimed a missile directly at Barnes' face, which he managed to push out of the way, causing it to destroy much of the entire \nHYDRA Siberian Facility\n around them. While the pair became separated, the Barnes regrouped with Captain America while Iron Man was briefly trapped under all of the debris.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man orders \nCaptain America\n to move\n \n \nAs Barnes made his way towards the exit, Iron Man freed himself and chased after him, only for Captain America to stand in his way. Captain America insisted that \nHoward and Maria's deaths\n were not Barnes' fault as \nHYDRA\n had control of his mind and it had been ordered by \nVasily Karpov\n, but this falls on deaf ears as Iron Man ordered him to move. Captain America damaged Iron Man's leg stabilizers before Iron Man used the laser to trap Captain America while he went for Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is knocked down\n \n \nWhile Iron Man quickly caught up with his target, who was attempted to climb up the building to reach the helicopter hatch in the roof, Iron Man kicked him across the facility and took aim at him yet again with a deadly kill shot. However, Captain America refused to stand down from the fight, deflecting a lethal repulsor back at Iron Man, disabling the \nMark XLVI\n's targeting system and using a wire to pull him down when Iron Man continued to chase after Barnes.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to shoot at \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nWhen Captain America threw his shield at him, Iron Man was able to shoot it out of the air, leaving Captain America now defenseless and unable to aid Barnes. As he could no longer target Barnes with his missiles, Stark opted to trap Barnes within the bunker for their final showdown. With \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n informing him that his weapons systems could not target him, Iron Man used his own eye to aim and shoot at Barnes, destroying the main hatch and trapping him inside.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man tries to strangle the \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nWith Barnes now trapped inside, Iron Man charged towards him as they engaged in hand-to-hand combat until Iron Man began crushing him under the Mark XLVI's weight. Holding him there, Iron Man then questioned if he even remembered killing \nhis mother\n and \nfather\n, with Barnes insisting that he remembered everyone who he had killed for \nHYDRA\n. Captain America jumped at the pair, knocking himself and Iron Man back down to the ground floor.\n[\n6\n]\nFinal Showdown\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man stands against \nCaptain America\n \n \n\"That \nshield\n doesn't belong to you! You don't deserve it! My \nfather\n made that shield!\"\nTony Stark to \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nAs Iron Man and \nCaptain America\n faced each other, Captain America insisted that nothing would change what happened all those years ago. Here, Iron Man stated in no uncertain terms that he was done listening to Rogers as the \nWinter Soldier\n had killed his own \nmother\n, which he would not forgive before Stark then charged forward and attacked his former friend, willing to even kill him in order to get to the Winter Soldier.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fighting against \nBucky Barnes\n \n \nIron Man quickly overpowered him in melee combat before \nBucky Barnes\n intervened by striking him with \nCaptain America's Shield\n, turning the fight into a \ntwo on one brawl\n. Iron Man responded to the uneven odds by blasting Captain America with a repulsor before he was forced against the wall by Barnes. Barnes attempted to remove the suit's \nArc Reactor\n with his \nrobotic arm\n to which Iron Man unleashed a Unibeam that disintegrated the majority of the arm.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man battles against \nCaptain America\n \n \nA recovered and enraged Captain America then stormed at Iron Man in order to defend Barnes from being executed, deflecting repulsor fire with his \nshield\n before forcing Iron Man back against the wall and pummeling him relentlessly. Despite having the \nMark XLVI\n to protect himself from all of the attacks, Iron Man soon found himself outmatched due to the \nSuper Soldier Serum\n that had given Captain America all of his strength and his superior fighting skills.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man gains the upper hand in their fight\n \n \nRealizing he was incapable of competing with Captain America in close quarters hand-to-hand combat, Iron Man ordered \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to analyze Captain America's movement patterns to find weaknesses to exploit. Iron Man overpowered Captain America in combat and then blew away the shield and brutally beat him into submission, using his suit's strength and repulsors to give himself the advantage and attacks Captain America. Unable to counter them all, Rogers is overwhelmed.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark asks \nCaptain America\n to stand down\n \n \nExhausted from the fight, Captain America tried once again to reason with Iron Man, defending Barnes as his friend before Iron Man commented that he had also once been his friend. Iron Man then beat Captain America down even more and tossed him aside. When Captain America got to his feet to continue the fight, claiming that he could do this all day, Iron Man aimed his repulsor beam directly at his face and gave Captain America a final chance to stand down and end the fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man's \nArc Reactor\n is broken by Rogers\n \n \nAs Captain America stood unyielding, Iron Man realized he would never stand down and charged a repulsor. A wounded Barnes grabbed Iron Man's boot, distracting him and Iron Man kicked Barnes in the face. This diversion allowed Captain America to turn the tide of the battle, using his own shield to destroy the \nMark XLVI\n's helmet. Instead of killing Iron Man, however, Captain America smashed his shield into the main \nArc Reactor\n, destroying it and leaving his armor now completely powerless.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man sees \nCaptain America\n walks away\n \n \nLeft covered in blood and now running purely on the suit's backup miniature Arc Reactors, Iron Man was unable to continue fighting as Captain America reclaimed the shield and helped Barnes onto his feet. But as he watched them leaving, Iron Man claimed that Captain America did not deserve his shield, since \nhis father\n had made it in \nWorld War II\n. Captain America reluctantly drops his \nvibranium\n shield, returning it to the Stark family, and left the scene with Barnes, leaving Iron Man behind alone.\n[\n6\n]\nSpider-Man's Beginning\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark films a video message for \nMay Parker\n \n \n\"Don't do anything I would do.

Stark then hugged Parker, covering up by saying he was getting the door for him and he and Hogan drove off. For two months, Parker would report to Hogan about all his activities as Spider-Man, telling him about the crimes he stopped as the Spider-Man, which Hogan would then send to Stark himself along with Parker's activities as the Spider-Man.\n[\n47\n]\nPicking Up the Pieces\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark returns to the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"Tony, we have a problem.\"\n\"Ah, please hold.\"\n\nThaddeus Ross\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nWith his friendship with \nSteve Rogers\n seemingly done for and the rest of the team either on the run or locked away, Stark had started searching for a new purpose for the \nAvengers\n in the wake of their leadership falling apart all around them. Having taken \nPeter Parker\n to his \nhome\n, Stark returned to the \nAvengers Compound\n where he began considering what the Avengers could become without Captain America.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark helps \nJames Rhodes\n' rehabilitation\n \n \nAt the same time, Stark had also developed some new technology in order to help \nJames Rhodes\n to walk again in the wake of his injury during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n. When Rhodes fell while testing the technology, they discussed the fallout of the \nSokovia Accords\n and Rhodes' belief that they had done the right thing.

By this time, Rogers \nfreed\n the imprisoned Avengers team from the \nRaft\n and \nThaddeus Ross\n called Stark for help. Stark put Ross on hold by pretending to be busy with something else, thus letting Rogers and his Avengers team escape successfully.\n[\n6\n]\n Some time later, Stark was contacted again by Ross in regards to \nNatasha Romanoff\n, but he put him on hold once again.\n[\n57\n]\nLaunching a Satellite\n[\n]\n\"You've been in here for two days straight.

Stark refused and chose to focus on his new Iron Man armor instead, so Hogan put the fast food he had ordered on the table while Stark asked for the specifics of the food. Stark showed Hogan the schematics for the armor, and Hogan voiced his concern that Stark was pushing himself too hard. Stark simply replied that if he did not, people would die.\nAfter some time, Hogan asked if Stark had heard from \nSteve Rogers\n, and Stark replied that he had not. He took inventory on what needed to be done on the suit of armor, reflecting on the events that occurred during his \nkidnapping\n in \nAfghanistan\n. He concluded that the armor's repulsors were not getting enough power and asked Hogan for help. He took a gadget Hogan was holding from him and placed it down while Hogan asked about \nPeter Parker\n. They talked about how talkative Parker was, and Stark tested his gauntlet, blasting a wall that crumbled completely.\nStark continued to work, prompting Hogan to sarcastically comment about how it seemed effective. They went for a walk, and Stark suggested they keep track of the \nAvengers\n better so they could be prepared for future threats. Stark told Hogan about the time he attempted to lift \nMjlnir\n, and asked him to reach out to whomever he could. Hogan commented on how weird the world was getting due to the coming threats, so Stark said that he had thought about it. He described the feeling he felt during the \nBattle of New York\n, wanting a way to access technology at the same level as \nAsgard\n.\nStark returned to his workspace and received a call from \nPepper Potts\n, telling him that he was late to an interview. Stark prepared for the interview as he contemplated the fact that they would need both technology and \nmagic\n to protect the world. During the interview, Stark got distracted, and the interviewer, \nChalmers\n, asked how Stark spent his time. Chalmers talked about people viewing the Avengers as a threat, though Stark said that the \nSokovia Accords\n would handle that. Chalmers asked about the \nbattle\n between Stark and \nHulk\n in \nJohannesburg\n, so Stark quickly left the interview.\nHogan contacted Stark and reminded him that \nStark Industries\n would be launching their \ncommunications satellite\n and that he was meant to meet \nMaria Hill\n at the launch. On the ride to the launch, Stark explained to Hogan that the satellite would send nano-satellites in all directions to be able to detect anything that was coming. Stark and Hogan watched the launch, and Stark explained to Hill that it would take a month for the nano-satellites to reach their positions. Stark expressed his hope of not finding anything, prompting Hill to comment that nothing would be a waste of money. At Hill's prompting, Stark added that if they found anything, he hoped they would be friendly. On the return trip, Stark thought about the experience of flying and wondered if the Iron Man armor was space-worthy. He thought about the icing problem he experienced with the \nIron Man Armor: Mark II\n and determined that he would try to make one that could fly in space.\nSome time later, Stark spent the weekend at the \nAvengers Compound\n monitoring the nano-satellites he launched and thought the task to be impossible. He was joined by \nHappy Hogan\n, who had brought takeout, saying that he thought Stark needed company. Hogan told Stark that he finally spoke to \nPeter Parker\n and said that his heart was in the right place. The two watched the monitors and Hogan used his fork to emulate the computer pinging, which Stark and Hogan laughed at. Stark stepped outside to take a call, and returned to find Hogan wearing the gauntlets to one of his \nIron Man armors\n. Hogan said that they were heavier than he thought, and Stark commented that the same was true of the whole suit.\n[\n18\n]\nAdvising Spider-Man\n[\n]\nEncounter with Vulture\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man saving \nSpider-Man\n from drowning\n \n \n\"Can't you just be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man?\"\n\"But I'm ready for more than that now!\"\n\"No, you're not.\"\nTony Stark and \nSpider-Man\n[src]\nTwo months after the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Stark was attending a party in \nIndia\n, \nSpider-Man\n tried to stop illegal smugglers working for \nVulture\n, but only to end up being dropped and drowned in a lake. Stark used the tracker he installed in the \nSpider-Man Suit\n and sent \nMark XLVII\n remotely to save him, arriving just in time to pull Spider-Man out of the lake before he could drown.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to \nPeter Parker\n \n \nTaking Spider-Man to a nearby park to calm down, Stark then asked him what he had been thinking trying to take down those criminals instead of letting other people to handle this. Parker questioned if he had put a tracker in the suit, to which Stark admitted that he had put everything in his suit, including the heater which dried him. Parker asked if those people were the \nAvengers\n only to be told by Stark that it was below their own pay wage to go after Vulture.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark speaking with \nPeter Parker\n from \nIndia\n \n \nStark asked Parker to forget about Vulture because he said so, accidentally screaming in the middle of the party. He then said to him to continue helping the little people, but Parker was convinced he was ready for more now, claiming that Stark also thought so when had took on \nCaptain America\n during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n. Stark ensured him that if he had wanted to, Captain America would have defeated him with some ease during their previous fight.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells Parker to stay away from \nVulture\n \n \nStark finished the call by telling Parker that if he saw the weapons being sold by the \nVulture's Crew\n again, he was not to get involved himself and to immediately to call up \nHappy Hogan\n and let him deal with the situation. Having given Parker this advice, Stark then hung up the call and sent the Mark XLVII back to the \nAvengers Compound\n while he drove away from the party, leaving Parker then to consider everything that he had just been advised to do by Stark.\n[\n47\n]\nStaten Island Ferry Incident\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark calls \nSpider-Man\n during his mission\n \n \n\"Please, \nthis\n is all I have.

God, I sound like my \ndad\n.\"\n\nPeter Parker\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nDeciding to take \nPeter Parker\n's information seriously, Stark alerted the \nFBI\n to \nVulture\n's illegal activities. Days later, Stark called up Parker to apologize and praise him for his actions in \nsaving\n his classmates in \nWashington, D.C.\n. Parker, however, was in the middle of trying to stop Vulture's \ncrew\n in the middle of a weapons deal on the \nSpirit of America\n and spent the phone call trying to distract Stark before he eventually hung up on him, much to Stark's annoyance.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man arrives to assist \nSpider-Man\n \n \nSuspicious, Stark decided to suit up in his \n Mark XLVII\n and arrived just in time to see the Ferry; Parker was on about to be torn apart thanks in part to \nSpider-Man\n's and Vulture's recent battle, during which a rogue \nChitauri Gun\n had lost control and fired all the way down the ferry. As Spider-Man had already defeated both \nShocker\n as well as \nMac Gargan\n, Iron Man then proceeded to fix the Ferry by pushing it back together while Spider-Man could only just watch on.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man successfully saves the entire ferry\n \n \nBy using his own \nStark Industries\n technology and the lasers in his armor, Iron Man used them both to meld the cut in the Ferry back together. When Spider-Man had asked if there was anything he could do to help, Iron Man simply told him that he had done enough before finishing saving the ferry. Iron Man then ordered Spider-Man to meet him in \nNew York City\n so that he could then chastise Spider-Man for disobeying him and putting his own and other people's lives at risks by his own actions.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man finds and confronts \nSpider-Man\n \n \nParker accused Stark about not caring what was happening with the stolen weapons, only for Stark to step out of his suit and told Parker that he did listen to him and that he was the one who contacted the FBI. Furthermore, Stark revealed that he was in fact the only one who believed in Parker's potential, despite his age, and that if someone had died there due to his actions, it would be on his conscience and if Parker himself died, then his death would be on his mind forever.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells \nPeter Parker\n to return his suit\n \n \nParker told Stark that he was just trying to be like him, only for Stark to tell him that he wanted him to be better than him and demanded Parker give the \nSpider-Man Suit\n back, much to Parker's dismay as he claimed that he was nothing without the suit. Stark replied that if he was nothing without the suit, then he shouldn't have it, while noting that he's starting to sound like his own father. Parker - much to his reluctance - gave the suit back and Stark sent him home to his \nAunt May\n with some clothes Stark had bought him.\n[\n47\n]\nSpider-Man's Offer\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark praises \nPeter Parker\n on his heroics\n \n \n\"With a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.\"\n\"To the to the team?\"\n\"Yeah.

Upon arrival, Stark met up with Parker and apologized for being so harsh on him previously and told him that his actions in stopping Vulture proved he was ready to be a hero.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark invites \nPeter Parker\n into the \nAvengers\n \n \nStark explained that he had gathered together reporters to meet him before showing Parker the \nIron Spider Armor\n, as Stark told him to put it on, so he could introduce him to a bunch of reporters as the newest member of the Avengers, noting he would have a room by \nVision\n. However, Parker declined, wanting to stay on the streets and look out for the citizens of \nNew York City\n as a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, much to the great surprise of Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark accepts \nPeter Parker\n's own decision\n \n \nStark, although a little disappointed, accepted Parker's decision, still offering him one last chance to take his offer which Parker said no to, telling Hogan to take Parker back home. Before leaving, Parker then asked if that was a test, to which Stark lied and said it was. However, as soon as Parker exited the building, \nPepper Potts\n came through asking where Parker was as all of the reporters were waiting, only for Stark to say that he was now not going to be there after all.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nPepper Potts\n kiss\n \n \nNow wondering what they were going to tell the press, Stark asked Hogan for the engagement ring which the latter had been keeping for years. Potts, however, assured them that they would be able to come up with something better and kissed Stark before they went out to meet the press although Hogan still threw Stark the ring as a last resort. Stark had the \nsecond suit\n delivered back to Parker, believing that the young hero had earned the right to wear it again.\n[\n47\n]\nReturn to Stark Industries\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares for the worst\n \n \nMonths later\n, working at the \nAvengers Compound\n, Stark, guilty that he got distracted, began work on a suit that could be used by him to defend the world by himself.\n[\n58\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and Parker pose for a photo\n \n \nWhile working on his new \nMark L\n armor, Stark was visited by \nMaria Hill\n, who tried to convince him to call Rogers and work out their grievances. Stark briefly considered calling Rogers, but decided that he needed to prepare for the apocalypse on his own. Hill then informed Stark that \nVision\n had turned off his transponder, and was off-grid. Stark became irritated after Hill made a remark that the last \nuncontrolled robot\n he created almost wiped out humanity, and claimed that the world needed all Avengers. An embittered Stark sent Hill away, and fired her from her position at \nStark Industries\n.\n[\n59\n]\n Around this time, Stark also presented \nPeter Parker\n with an official Stark Industries certificate of internship completion, and the pair posed for a photo. Stark then framed the photograph and kept it amongst his personal belongings.\n[\n8\n]\nInfinity War\n[\n]\nMeeting Doctor Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to \nPepper Potts\n at Central Park\n \n \n\"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.

Despite Stark's claims on how real the dream felt, Potts assured him that she was not expecting a child and suggested that if he wanted to have a kid, he would not have made \nanother suit of armor\n. Stark reinforced that the armor was only there to protect her and their future children, but Potts rebuttaled by stating that the armor was not required in order to raise a normal family.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nPotts\n meet \nDoctor Strange\n \n \nStark then declared that there would not be any more surprises between them and promised Potts a dinner date in light of their recent engagement. \nDoctor Strange\n then appeared from a \nportal\n and told Stark that he would need to talk to him. Having never met Strange, Stark became skeptical at his statement, but Strange reiterated that the fate of the universe was at stake; bringing \nBruce Banner\n out to stress how urgent the matter was.\n[\n11\n]\nConvening at the Sanctum Sanctorum\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark being informed of the \nInfinity Stones\n \n \n\"\nThanos\n.

He was informed by \nWong\n, who explained the history of the \nInfinity Stones\n; Strange named all of the stones that were known such as the \nSpace\n, \nReality\n, \nPower\n, \nSoul\n, \nMind\n, and \nTime\n. Stark inquired the enemy's name and was informed by Banner that it was \nThanos\n, explaining that he had \nacquired\n the Power and Space Stones; making him the most powerful being in the universe.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nBruce Banner\n discussing \nThanos\n \n \nHaving learned that Thanos was the one who pulled the strings behind \nLoki\n and the \nChitauri Invasion\n, Stark realized that he was the one who was really responsible for his fear and anxiety in the ensuing years since the \nBattle of New York\n. Leaning and stretching against the \nCauldron of the Cosmos\n, Stark remarked on Strange's use of language, getting hit by the \nCloak of Levitation\n, much to his allowance. Stark suggested disposing the Time Stone, but Strange and Wong informed him they were sworn to protect it.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark notices ruckus coming from outside\n \n \nAs Thanos had two stones and the other two were not on \nEarth\n, the best move would be to protect \nVision\n, who had the Mind Stone embedded in his head; however, Vision had disappeared two weeks earlier. Only the fugitive \nCaptain America\n could possibly find him. Banner insisted that Stark call Rogers, only for Stark to explain to Banner that he and Rogers had \nfallen out\n, and that they were not on speaking terms. Banner would convince Stark to call Rogers by telling him that Thanos had killed their teammate \nThor\n. However, before Stark could place the call, they were interrupted by the sound of agitation in the streets and debris flying through the air.\n[\n11\n]\nProtecting Doctor Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark faces \nEbony Maw\n and \nCull Obsidian\n \n \n\"Hear me and rejoice.

Outside the \nNew York Sanctum\n, the Q-Ship was confronted by Tony Stark, \nBruce Banner\n, \nDoctor Strange\n and \nWong\n. As Stark commanded \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to evacuate the surrounding area and mobilize emergency response teams, Doctor Strange cast the \nWinds of Watoomb\n, neutralizing the powerful winds created by the Q-Ship.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man donning the \nMark L armor\n to fight\n \n \nAs \nEbony Maw\n and \nCull Obsidian\n arrived from their Q-Ship, they demanded the \nTime Stone\n, kept in the \nEye of Agamotto\n, from Strange, only for Stark to rudely rebuff and commanded the two to leave \nEarth\n. To Stark's embarrassment, Banner tried and failed to turn into Hulk; as they did not have time to understand why, Stark benched his friend from the fight. Stark donned his nanotech \nMark L armor\n and blasted away Obsidian, astonishing Banner.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man and \nStrange\n fight \nEbony Maw\n \n \nMaw then sent Iron Man flying into the air while directly assaulting Strange and Wong with his telekinetic powers, throwing debris at the Masters. As Strange began using an attack, Iron Man returned and blasted off a car that was aimed at him and Wong. He then commanded Strange to also flee and get the Time Stone away from the city, who refused. Iron Man attempted to assault Maw again, only to be engaged by Obsidian, who sent Iron Man flying into Washington Square Park, encountering Banner.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is saved by \nWong\n \n \nWhile holding off Obsidian to protect Banner, Iron Man was joined by an arriving \nSpider-Man\n and told him about what was going on with the situation. Iron Man tasked him with rescuing the unconscious Strange as he held off Obsidian. As the battle continued, Iron Man was caught by Obsidian's \nhammer\n and was about to be killed, only to be saved by Wong. Once Wong trapped Obsidian from \nanother location\n, Iron Man broke free and invited him to his wedding, flying afterwards.\n[\n11\n]\nAscent to Space\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man flies up to save \nSpider-Man\n \n \n\"Tony?

Beginning to run out of oxygen, \nSpider-Man\n removed his mask as he was unable to breathe as much as he could. Iron Man commanded Spider-Man to let go and fall in order to catch him. Spider-Man told Iron Man that he must save the \nwizard\n as he was told by him, but Iron Man retorted his statement that he would not be able to breathe as the ship moved upward.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man deploys \nSpider-Man\n's new armor\n \n \nAs he exhaustively started to pass out, Spider-Man was nearly suffocated as the ship left \nEarth\n's atmosphere and he fell off the ship as he could not breathe anymore. Falling down, Spider-Man was rescued by the intervention of Iron Man, who summoned the Iron Spider Armor. As the suit manifested around him with \nnanotech particles\n, Spider-Man swiftly recovered with an acrobatic landing and was able to breathe and contact Iron Man.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man going onboard inside the \nQ-Ship\n \n \nAs he caught up with Parker, Stark told him farewell up on the ship and commanded \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to send him back to Earth, using his parachute to descend into orbit. Stark latched onto the hull to cut a hole and board the Q-Ship, to look for wherever Doctor Strange and \nEbony Maw\n went. Getting a call from \nPepper Potts\n, Stark answered the call and told her that he was on the ship, only to lose reception halfway at Potts' expense.\n[\n11\n]\nRescue of Doctor Strange\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark notices \nSpider-Man\n onboard the \nQ-Ship\n \n \n\"Saving \nhis\n life is more of a professional courtesy.\"\n\"You've saved nothing.

As they prepared their next move, observing from above, they were surprised by the appearance of \nSpider-Man\n, who had also stowed away, much to Stark's horror. As Stark berated Peter Parker for disobeying his orders, Parker reasoned that he could not act as a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man without a neighborhood to defend.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listening to \nSpider-Man\n's latest plan\n \n \nListening to Parker's response and knowing that he could not argue against it, Stark had no choice but to team up with him and decided to give him assess of the situation. Walking towards the ledge, Stark told Parker where \nEbony Maw\n was holding Strange captive and asked for any ideas to distract him. Thinking quickly, Parker immediately suggested a plan that reminisced a scene from \nAliens\n. Once he listened, Stark would then follow the plan before Strange would be further tortured by Maw.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man interrupts \nMaw\n's interrogation\n \n \nAs Maw continued to probe Strange for the Time Stone, Iron Man suddenly appeared behind him. As part of Parker's plan, Stark fired a missile past Maw, into the wall of the Q-Ship. The missile caused a hull breach, instantly sucking a screaming Maw into the vacuum of space to his death. However, Strange himself was inadvertently caught in the vacuum, and the Cloak unsuccessfully attempted to rescue him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark considers his next course of action\n \n \nLeaping in, Spider-Man managed to grab Strange, and with aid from his new \narmor\n's artificial spider limbs, he was able to narrowly pull him to safety, allowing Iron Man to seal the breach using his \nnanobots\n. Stark noted that the Ship was on an automated course bound for an \nunknown location\n. Strange insisted that Stark commandeer the ship to return them and the Time Stone to \nEarth\n, although Stark was reluctant.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark declaring \nSpider-Man\n as an \nAvenger\n \n \nStark suggested a proposal for an attack on \nThanos\n' territory, where he would not be expecting. Although initially at odds, Strange reluctantly agreed with Stark's plan, after he told of his history over the years about Thanos' discourse. After agreeing, Strange reminded Stark that he would prioritize saving the Time Stone over either Stark or Parker's lives, asserting he would let them die if it would mean keeping the Stone from Thanos' hands. Satisfied by Strange's display of morality, Stark would then officially recruit Peter Parker to the \nAvengers\n.\n[\n11\n]\nEncountering the Guardians\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark attempting to steer the \nQ-Ship\n \n \n\"I'm gonna ask you this one time.

Despite the attempt to avoid contact with the planet's surroundings, the ship crash-landed. \nDoctor Strange\n protected Stark and Parker from the impact of the crash-landing by \nshielding\n them through holographic \nMandalas\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark scolding \nSpider-Man\n for his humor\n \n \nStark acknowledged that he owed Strange a debt for saving their lives from the crash. Parker appeared upside down and asked them if there was something that could implant eggs in his chest. Stark angrily commented to him to never say anything pop culture related, but Parker was stating that something was coming towards them. Following Parker's warning, a grenade rolled into view, and the three got thrown back when its energy pulse was fired.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man firing a missile at \nStar-Lord\n \n \nThe three were then immediately ambushed by the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, \nStar-Lord\n, \nDrax the Destroyer\n, and \nMantis\n, each believing the other to be working for \nThanos\n. Star-Lord immediately started firing at Iron Man, and a chase in the air ensued. Stark launched a missile at Star-Lord while in the air but was pinned by his \nGravity Mine\n in retaliation. Escaping Quill's Gravity Mine, Iron Man then flew over to Drax in order to capture and pin him down. As the brief scuffle ended at a stalemate, Spider-Man was held at gunpoint by Quill.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark questioning \nStar-Lord\n's interference\n \n \nTurning off his \nhelmet\n, Star-Lord then asked Stark where his missing teammate, \nGamora\n, was. Agitated with his abrupt attack, Stark replied with a question that confused Quill and then asked who the three \nhumans\n were that he was attacking. Parker answered his question by saying that they were the \nAvengers\n. Eventually, once Mantis informed Stark about being acknowledged by \nThor\n, both parties learned that they were both after Thanos and an alliance was formed between them.\n[\n11\n]\nMaking a Plan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark announces his plan against \nThanos\n \n \n\"Did you hear what I said?\"\n\"I stopped listening after you said, 'We need a plan.'\n\"Okay, \nMr. Clean\n is on his own page.\"\nTony Stark and \nDrax the Destroyer\n[src]\nAnalyzing the situation and the surroundings, Stark realized that their only advantage was that \nThanos\n was coming to them, and thus the element of surprise could be utilized. The plan was simple: draw Thanos in, pin him down, and take the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n. As Stark tried to come up with a plan to stop Thanos, \nDrax\n yawned at the middle of the plan. \nStar-Lord\n explained that listening and not winging it was not what they would do, and \nSpider-Man\n questioned what exactly the rest of the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n were doing.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark witnessing \nDoctor Strange\n's actions\n \n \nMantis\n explained what they would do in an uncomprehending statement to which both Parker and Stark were completely dumbfounded. Stark told Star-Lord to get his team together, and when Quill expressed that while the plan was solid, he should execute it instead of Stark for a better outcome. As the plan was being formulated, \nDoctor Strange\n used the \nTime Stone\n to view millions of different outcomes of the coming conflict against Thanos, to which he said there was only \none future conflict\n in which they won.\n[\n11\n]\nBattle of Titan\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attacking directly at \nThanos\n \n \n\"Piece of cake, Quill.\"\n\"Yeah, if your goal is to piss \nhim\n off!\"\nIron Man and \nStar-Lord\n[src]\nWhen \nThanos\n arrived on \nTitan\n, he was immediately greeted by \nDoctor Strange\n. Thanos recounted to the sorcerer how Titan was a beautiful planet with too little food and resources to go around for its \npeople\n. When the Titans faced extinction, Thanos' \"merciful\" resolution was genocide across multiple planets.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is attacked by \nThanos\n' power\n \n \nAt this moment, Thanos realized too late that Strange was not alone, and had lured the Titan into an ambush. Before he could react, he was immediately crushed underneath a massive piece of a spaceship hull, dropped on him by Iron Man. Using the \nPower\n and \nReality\n Stones, the Titan freed himself by violently detonating the debris, before instantly transforming the rubble into an enormous swarm of bats.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man aerially battling against \nThanos\n \n \nThe swarm quickly set upon Iron Man, forcing the \nAvenger\n to flee. Thanos was then bombarded by a renewed assault from Iron Man, who rained missiles down on the Titan. Unfazed, and with the \nGauntlet\n freed, Thanos activated the Power and \nSpace\n Stones. In a second, the explosive energy of Stark's missiles was absorbed by the Gauntlet and redirected at Iron Man in a concentrated beam of fire, blasting the Avenger far away into a spaceship husk.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man attempts to pull off the \nGauntlet\n \n \nWith Thanos restrained, the group had executed the final step of their plan, as \nMantis\n beckoned the others to hurry before Thanos broke her hold. Iron Man and \nSpider-Man\n moved to forcefully pull the Gauntlet from the Titan's hand. Flying in, \nStar-Lord\n confronted Thanos, before demanding the location of \nGamora\n. Thanos began to react in anguish, with Mantis sensing that he was mourning. \nNebula\n began to realize in horror that he \nsacrificed\n Gamora for the \nSoul Stone\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man stops \nStar-Lord\n from interfering\n \n \nIn denial, Star-Lord angrily asked Thanos to tell him that Gamora was alive, only for Thanos to lament that he had no choice but to kill her, confirming Nebula's suspicions. Enraged, Star-Lord began to question Thanos for his actions. Observing this, Iron Man attempted to restrain him from any contact with Thanos, only for Star-Lord to ruthlessly attack him without thinking, inadvertently breaking Mantis' control over the Titan.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man desperately attacks \nThanos\n \n \nFreed from his trance and now truly furious, Thanos quickly escaped his restraints and brutally overpowered the group. Iron Man made another desperate assault on Thanos, only for the Titan to turn to Titan's nearby moon. Using the Power and Space Stones, Thanos immediately pulverized the moon's surface, before hurling its fragments down on his opponents as a hail of meteors, incapacitating Iron Man.\n[\n11\n]\nLast Man Standing\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man stormily confronting \nThanos\n \n \n\"Stark.\"\n\"You know me?\"\n\"I do.

To the Avenger's surprise, Thanos recognized and called him by his name of Stark, before noting that they were both \"cursed with knowledge.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man aggressively fights against \nThanos\n \n \nUnfazed from Thanos' statements, Iron Man blamed him for his existences to be a curse, and attacked him first, blasting him with missiles. With Thanos distracted, Iron Man began attacking him relentlessly with his \nnanotech suit\n, kicking the Titan with his enhanced boosters before he could recover. Anchoring his feet to the ground, Iron Man immediately struck Thanos again with repulsor-powered battering rams, beating him back into a wall.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man blocking \nThanos\n' attacks\n \n \nRecovering quickly, Thanos tore off Iron Man's helmet with his bare hand and punched him to the ground. As Iron Man reformed his helmet just in time, Thanos quickly ripped the clamp from the Gauntlet, and blasted him with a concentrated beam from the \nPower Stone\n. Iron Man then managed to block the blast by forming a shield. Boosting towards Thanos, Iron Man swiftly pinned the Gauntlet to the ground using a foot clamp before pummeling the Titan's face with a repulsor-boosted hammer, with enough force to make him bleed.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man being taunted by \nThanos\n \n \nUnfazed from the damage upon his face, Thanos simply taunted the Avenger, for giving so much labor and struggle only to shed a single drop of blood. Thanos then effortlessly ripped the Gauntlet free from Iron Man's hold, flipping the Avenger onto his back. Thanos began to brutally beat Iron Man with his fists, breaking off more and more of his armor with each strike to the point of which he could not defend himself any longer.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man using his repulsors against \nThanos\n \n \nWith Iron Man helpless to resist, Thanos followed with a powerful punched with the Power Stone into the Avenger's abdomen, sending him flying across the area and damaging his armor. Desperate and missing much of the upper half of his armor, Iron Man attempted to hold off Thanos with his repulsors, relocating the \nnanites\n on his leg to form new repulsors. Closing in, Thanos began beating the Avenger once again, destroying his helmet.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man being brutally stabbed by \nThanos\n \n \nStark attempted to defend himself with his bare hands, only for Thanos to grab and trap his left hand. In an attempt to fight back, Stark immediately shifted the nanites from his left arm to his right arm to form a sword, and wildly stabbed at the Titan. However, Thanos simply tore the sword from Stark's hand and ruthlessly stabbed him in the abdomen with it, ending the fight. Cradling Stark's head in his hand, Thanos revealed his respect for Stark.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark being wounded after fighting \nThanos\n \n \nNevertheless, Thanos said he hoped those who survive when he ended his \nmission\n would remember Stark and he prepared himself to kill him, only for Strange to intervene, offering the \nTime Stone\n in exchange for Stark's life. After Thanos took the Time Stone and left \nTitan\n, Stark would heal his wound, using the last of his nanites. Asking Strange why he would give up the Stone, Strange informed Stark that they were now in the endgame.\n[\n11\n]\nThanos' Victory\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark witnessing his allies turning into dust\n \n \n\"Mr. Stark? I don't feel so good.\"\n\"You're all right.\"\n\"I don't I don't know what's happening. I don't I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go.\"\n\nPeter Parker\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nStark and his allies could only wait for \nThanos\n to achieve his goals, and he unlocked the powers of all combined \nInfinity Stones\n. Many of his allies began disintegrating into ash, including \nDoctor Strange\n and the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n on \nTitan\n, much to his horror and distress. Stark attempted to reassure \nStar-Lord\n before his demise and was then told by Doctor Strange that this outcome was inevitable.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark mourns over the demise of his allies\n \n \nStark could only helplessly watch as \nSpider-Man\n then began disintegrating in his arms. Stark hugged the boy in an attempt to comfort him as Spider-Man begged Stark to save him until he accepted his fate and emotionally apologized for failing him. In the end, only Stark and \nNebula\n remained on Titan. As Nebula somberly said in despair that Thanos had achieved his goal, Stark began mourning over the loss of his friends and Thanos' victory, unable to do anything but accept it, as he clutched Spider-Man's ashes.\n[\n11\n]\nReturning to Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nNebula\n try to repair the \nBenatar\n \n \n\"Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning. And that'll be it. And \nPep\n, I I know I said no more surprises, but I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nDirectly after the \nSnap\n, Stark and \nNebula\n used the \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n's ship, the \nBenatar\n, to get off \nTitan\n. Over the course of time they spent, Stark and Nebula discovered that the ship's fuel cells had been cracked during the climax of the \nBattle of Titan\n. Attempting to fix it, they at least partially succeeded by working around the damage and tried to make it back to \nEarth\n; however, the \nBenatar\n ran of flight power after only two days and gradually began running out of air, the former of which stranded the ship. Stark and Nebula attempted to fix this as well, but they simply failed to do so, leaving them lost in space.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark plays a friendly game with \nNebula\n \n \nTwenty-two days after the Snap, Stark and Nebula played a few rounds of Table Football in the bridge of the \nBenatar\n. As Nebula tried to catch one of the paper shards, Stark said that she would not need to do that and taught Nebula on how to play by letting their fingers still in position. As they continued to play more of the game, Stark and Nebula were eventually almost tied up and asked her if she would like to try again. Stark tried to make a goal but lost his aim, letting Nebula win the game and showed respect to her with a handshake.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark leaves his message for \nPepper Potts\n \n \nStark went to the front of the \nBenatar\n to record a message to \nPepper Potts\n, using his \nhelmet\n from the Battle of Titan. After Stark turned on the switch to record from his helmet, he told Potts that if she would find the video of this recording, she should not post it on social media due to the sad situation he was in. Stark reflected on the past days of his survival, such as meeting Nebula, getting treatment from his injuries, fixing the ion charge from the ship that saved them forty-eight hours of time, and eating the remaining food rations.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark concludes his info during recording\n \n \nStark had then told Potts that the oxygen from the ship would run out the following morning, and that he hoped to pull off one last surprise. Stark told to not feel bad about his predicament and maybe just grovel and feel guilt for next upcoming weeks while he would be gone. Stark began to drift off from the recording and finished the recording by saying he would promise to dream about Potts since it was always what he dreamed about. After finishing the recording, Stark put on his jacket and drifted off to sleep before Nebula put him in the captain's chair.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sees \nCaptain Marvel\n hovering in space\n \n \nWhile deeply sleeping from the chair for hours, Stark felt a slight arise of light coming from his face, causing some irritation. Stark suddenly awoke due to a beaming light outside the \nBenatar\n and as the glowing settled, \nCaptain Marvel\n revealed herself to be the glowing light, much to his surprise. As the group had decided to return to \nEarth\n, Danvers subsequently started to carry the \nBenatar\n back to Earth, locating across the \nAvengers Compound\n where Stark would resign.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nPepper Potts\n are finally reunited\n \n \nGetting the attention from the \nAvengers\n at the Facility, Captain Marvel landed on the ground where the \nBenatar\n had settled. Stark would be helped out by Nebula and \nSteve Rogers\n, once he got out of the ship's doorway. An emotional Stark told Rogers that he was unable to stop \nThanos\n, to which Rogers had responded back saying he could not as well. Stark then looked at Rogers and told him that he lost \nPeter Parker\n in the process. Before he had anything else to say, Stark was then greeted by an overwhelmed Potts.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sees a picture of \nPeter Parker\n \n \nAt the Avengers Compound, the remaining Avengers conversed about the possible location of Thanos since the remaining days of him arriving to Earth. As the slide of pictures that were shown off from their system, Stark saw a picture of Parker as one of the casualties of Thanos' Snap, leading him to look down and reminisce on his failure to protect the kid. Stark then asked the team about where Thanos was, to which Rogers responded that they had no lead.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark meets \nRocket\n \n \nStark looked over to \nThor\n and asked the team what had happened to him, leading \nRocket\n to tell him that he was guilty of failing to kill Thanos. While Rocket talked about the failure of each trying to stop Thanos, Stark was completely surprised to see a talking \nraccoon\n, thinking he was a stuffed \nBuild-A-Bear\n. When Rogers told Stark they had been hunting Thanos for weeks and asked him if he had any indications of where Thanos could be, Stark mockingly erupted and told Rogers that he was beaten.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark blaming \nSteve Rogers\n about the past\n \n \nStark talked to the team about the vision he had that he did not want to believe and saw it coming. As Rogers tried to tell him that he needed to focus, Stark angrily told Rogers that he needed him in past tense, but it was too late to do that. As he began to fumble around the table and took off his tube from his arm, Stark then confronted Rogers, explaining that his attempt to build \na suit of armor around the world\n was to prevent the very situation they were in.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark resting with \nPepper Potts\n by his side\n \n \nStark then recalled the events of the \nAvengers Civil War\n, as he lost without the aid of Rogers, despite Rogers saying that if they lost, they would lose together. After giving up his \nArc Reactor\n to Rogers in order to stop Thanos, Stark overcame his exhaustion and fainted in front of the team. \nBruce Banner\n gave Stark a sedative, so that he could rest and heal due to his long duration in space. While Stark was resting, the remaining Avengers had \nfound\n Thanos, only to realize the \nInfinity Stones\n had been destroyed, leading \nThor\n to decapitate Thanos.\n[\n8\n]\nA Normal Life\n[\n]\nIn Mexico with Bruce Banner\n[\n]\n\"Tony mostly drank, just sat around, like, complaining about \nSteve\n.\"\n\"Oh, Steve.\"\n\"It was a good time during a \nhard time\n.\"\n\nHulk\n and \nShe-Hulk\n[src]\nStark and \nBruce Banner\n briefly went to a \nprivate island\n. There, Stark helped Banner merge himself with the Hulk. They also created a house as well as a \nbar\n, where Stark often complained about \nSteve Rogers\n. In the end, Stark and Banner both carved their initials into the bar.\n[\n60\n]\nReunited Again\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nTony calls out for \nMorgan Stark\n's attention\n \n \n\"Tony, I get it.

If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.\"\n\nCaptain America\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nTony eventually married \nPepper Potts\n and in \n2019\n, had a daughter, named \nMorgan\n, and relocated to a \ncabin\n in \nNew York\n. Despite losing his allies and half the universe's population to \nThanos\n, Tony began to feel a sense of peace in the five years that followed.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony tells \nMorgan Stark\n that lunch is ready\n \n \nIn \nOctober 2023\n, Tony walked outside of his cabin and began to give his attention from Morgan so that she could get some lunch. After not having Morgan's attention, Tony sat down and called her full name again, to which Morgan got out of the tent with her \nmother\n's \nMark XLIX\n helmet. Tony told Morgan not to wear the helmet since it was an anniversary gift for Potts, before taking her helmet off and asking if she was hungry for lunch. Tony then asked where Morgan found the helmet before picking her up, being told that she found it in his garage.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony is suddenly approached by his allies\n \n \nWhile Tony and his daughter were about to enter back into the cabin, he was approached by \nSteve Rogers\n, \nNatasha Romanoff\n, and \nScott Lang\n, who proposed their idea of \ntraveling back in time\n to acquire the \nInfinity Stones\n from the past in order to reverse Thanos' actions in the present. Tony disagreed with the group's decision to use \nQuantum\n energy to mess with the time scale or else they would never return to their original timeline.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony proposes to not mess with time\n \n \nOnce Lang told Tony that he came back from the past, he told Lang that his case was a billion-to-one chance of a cosmic fluke, thus it could not happen, being told that the group was pulling a \nTime Heist\n. Tony continued to tell the group that it was pipe dream to travel back in time: However, Rogers and Romanoff told him that they could get everyone back by snapping their fingers to do it. Tony still kept himself skeptical for not having a logical set to pull off a time heist.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony declines on joining the \nTime Heist\n \n \nWhen Lang sat down with Tony by saying that they would follow strict rules of time travel, he reluctantly rejected his proposal with concern about following logic from \nBack to the Future\n, saying that it was not how quantum physics should work. Despite the group taking a stand to fix what had happened to everyone, Tony still pursued on not joining the heist before Morgan was told to save him by Potts. Rogers told Tony this was their second chance, but he told Rogers that he already had one and still offered them to stay for lunchtime.\n[\n8\n]\nSolving Time Travel\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nTony wonders on the idea of \ntime travel\n \n \n\"I figured it out, by the way.\"\n\"You know, just so we're talking about the same thing\"\n\"\nTime travel\n.\"\nTony Stark and \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nAt night, while washing the dishes after dinner, Tony accidentally sprayed an old photo of himself and \nPeter Parker\n with water and began cleaning it with a rag. Missing Parker's existence and pondering on the idea of time traveling, Tony decided to take it upon himself on testing out one of the theoretical models that would work with \nScott Lang\n's \nQuantum Tunnel\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony figures out \ntime travel\n \n \nGoing up to his worktable, Tony began working on a \nTime-Space GPS\n that would enable the device that could have particle factoring and a spectral decomp to travel through the device. Despite his skepticism, Tony was in complete shock once the device had successfully rendered. Being bewildered by this discovery, Tony let out a swear before noticing \nMorgan Stark\n sitting on a staircase and told that she should not swear around the house and should go to bed.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony gives \nMorgan Stark\n a goodnight kiss\n \n \nTony told Morgan that he had something on his mind, to which she wondered if she wanted juice pops, much to his agreement on getting some after his discovery. After Tony and Morgan finished their juice pops, Tony told her go to bed and sleep before being told to tell a story. After telling a quick a story, Tony told Morgan that he loved her tons before being told back that she loved him three thousand, much to his loving surprise. Once Tony had got Morgan to sleep, he went into the living room where \nPepper Potts\n was reading a book.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony talks to \nPepper Potts\n \n \nWhile talking to Potts and looking towards his lab table, Tony quickly admitted on figuring out how time travel would work. Much to Potts' surprise on his incredible discovery, Tony sat down with her and was told they were lucky to have survived, unlike everybody else. Potts told Tony that he could do something about his discovery, but he told her that he could stop trying to save everybody: However, Potts admitted that trying to get him stop was one of her failures.\n \n \n \n \n \nTony tells \nPepper Potts\n about his future\n \n \nSmiling at the prospect of Potts not giving up on him, Tony admitted that sometimes he would feel like he should put his optimism in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake so that he could finally rest. Potts then questioned that if Tony was able to rest now, to which he decided on helping his \nteam\n on pulling the \nTime Heist\n. Realizing that the chances of survival were improbable and not guaranteed, Tony recorded a parting message to his family in the event that he would die under any circumstances.\n[\n8\n]\nTime Heist\n[\n]\nReturning to the Avengers\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark arrives at the \nAvengers Compound\n \n \n\"We got a shot at getting these \nstones\n, but I gotta tell you my priorities. Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I found? I have to, at all costs. And, maybe not die trying will be nice.\"\n\"Sounds like a deal.\"\nTony Stark and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nDespite Stark's initial refusal to help, the remaining \nAvengers\n continued to research the possibility of \ntime travel\n, and attempted to send \nScott Lang\n through time but instead sent time through him, turning Lang into a baby, child, and old man. With no other option to undo the \nSnap\n, the Avengers almost lost all hope but just then, Stark arrived at the \nAvengers Compound\n, much to the surprise of \nSteve Rogers\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark shows off his new \nTime-Space GPS\n \n \nOnce Stark had parked his car in front of Rogers, he rightly guessed that the Avengers' first attempt to time travel was a failure. When Rogers asked Stark why he arrived at the compound, Stark got out of his car and told him that the \nEPR paradox\n had affected Lang by letting time go pass through him. Rogers guessed that Stark had solved time travel, to which he admitted on inventing a \nTime-Space GPS\n. Stark then reconciled with Rogers, noting that resentment was corrosive, and he hated it. Rogers said he hated resentment as well.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark gives \nSteve Rogers\n back his \nshield\n \n \nStark then talked about the conditions of his life before joining the heist, wanting the \nInfinity Stones\n to bring back the people who were dead but not having to die trying. As they both agreed, Stark and Rogers reconciled and worked on the \nTime Heist\n. Before they could work on the heist, Stark gave Rogers back his \nshield\n, although Rogers was hesitant, Stark further told him that his father, \nHoward Stark\n, made it for him and he needed to get it out of the \nhouse\n before \nMorgan\n would find it and take it sledding.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to \nRocket\n \n \nKnowing they would get a team together, Stark walked inside the Avengers Compound with equipment on him, noticing \nThor\n's arrival, and made fun of his resemblances for looking like \nThe Big Lebowski\n. Stark asked \nRocket\n on how he was working with the \ntime machine\n, only to be insulted after mistakenly misnaming him. Stark then produced the \nTime Suit\n with help from \nHank Pym\n's designs and worked with \nBruce Banner\n to send \nClint Barton\n to the past.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark learns the success of \ntime traveling\n \n \nThe operation was a success as Barton landed in his \nhomestead\n at a time before the \nSnap\n before returning to \n2023\n. Following this, Stark worked with the Avengers to determine the best times and locations to travel back to. During their brainstorming session, Banner noted they only have enough \nPym Particles\n for one round trip each, and the Infinity Stones had a lot of different places throughout history.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and the \nAvengers\n settle on the plan\n \n \nStark further noted that each group was going through their history, which would mean there were not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in every given timeline. With each brainstorming session, the team's decisions had been concluded being \nNew York City\n in \n2012\n, \nAsgard\n in \n2013\n, and \nVormir\n and \nMorag\n in \n2014\n. The Avengers then decided to pull off their heist the following day, prompting Stark to use his \nhelmet\n to record a message for Morgan in the event that he did not survive.\n[\n8\n]\n Additionally, he named one of his A.I. systems \nE.D.I.T.H.\n, standing for \"Even Dead I'm The Hero\", which he uploaded into one of his \nglasses\n. Believing that their efforts to \nresurrect\n the victims of the Snap would be successful, Stark arranged for the glasses to be given to \nNick Fury\n following the latter's resurrection in the event that he died, with the explicit purpose of having Fury hand it down to \nPeter Parker\n.\n[\n7\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to \ntime travel\n to \n2012\n \n \nThe next day, as the team had gathered around the circle, Stark and the rest listened up for Rogers' speech about how they lost friends, family, a part of themselves but now they might have a chance to get them back. Knowing that this plan was the fight of their lives, Stark looked at Rogers being told that they were going to win for whatever it would take. Once the team was in position, Stark told Banner to activate the tunnel. As the team had finally united on the platform, Stark and his group traveled through time to 2012.\n[\n8\n]\nInfiltrating Stark Tower\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark arrives in \nNew York City\n back in \n2012\n \n \n\"Thumbelina, do you copy?

It's go-time.\"\nTony Stark to \nAnt-Man\n[src]\nThe first team, comprised of Stark, \nScott Lang\n, \nSteve Rogers\n, and \nHulk\n, traveled back to \nNew York City\n on \nMay 4, 2012\n during the \nBattle of New York\n. Rogers informed the group that they all knew their positions on where the \nInfinity Stones\n were. While they talked about keeping an eye on each other and getting out as quickly as possible, \nHulk from 2012\n had smashed a \nChitauri\n soldier through wreckage, much to the group's dismay.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark furtively infiltrates \nStark Tower\n \n \nHulk was assigned to \nfind\n the \nTime Stone\n at the \nNew York Sanctum\n, smashing things along the way to not give any suspicions. Stark and Lang went to \nStark Tower\n to \nretrieve\n the \nTesseract\n, while Rogers \nfocused\n primarily on the \nScepter\n. Stark climbed onto the \nChrysler Building\n and focused on the \nAvengers\n from 2012 interrogating \nLoki\n. Stark told Rogers to get inside \nStark Tower\n, noted they were almost wrapped up on capturing Loki.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nAnt-Man\n infiltrating \nStark Tower\n \n \nStark, with a shrunken Lang on his shoulder, quietly entered Stark Tower successfully without being noticed. While Stark watched \nhis past self\n and the Avengers clear from clean-up duty and capture Loki, he commented on the size of \nCaptain America\n's buttocks being crapped into his \nformer uniform\n. After \nBlack Widow\n grabbed the Scepter, the \nSTRIKE\n Team had entered the building, leaving Stark and Lang to hide out of sight. Stark further noted that the STRIKE team was part of \nHYDRA\n before quieting Lang's voice.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark leads \nSteve Rogers\n to the \nScepter\n \n \nStark then flicked Lang towards his 2012 self in order to get closer to the Tesseract. Once their plan had settled out, Stark proceeded to flee out of the tower and located the Scepter near an elevator so that Rogers could meet up with other \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n agents. While Rogers had to capture the Scepter from Agent \nJasper Sitwell\n, Stark managed to get a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform and went undercover while his past self arrived on the spot of where they met \nAlexander Pierce\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark goes undercover as an agent\n \n \nStark then ordered Lang that he was on the area of where his past self was located and told him to go into 2012 Stark's shirt. While Lang went under 2012 Stark's shirt, he smelled \nAxe\n body spray on 2012 Stark's shirt, having 2023 Stark to explain he had one under a desk for emergencies. Under Stark's guidance, Lang entered the inside of his \nArc Reactor\n and was told to pull the lever that would temporarily give Stark's past self a mild cardiac arrest. When Lang damaged it, Stark's past self suffered a heart attack.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark steals the \nTesseract\n from \nhis past self\n \n \nUsing the distraction caused by 2012 Stark's collapse to their advantage, 2023 Stark told the security guards that 2012 Stark might need some help. While 2012 Stark had suffered pain from his heart, 2023 Stark had noticed Lang pushing the briefcase with the Tesseract and began to take it, walking away to escape. Despite successfully obtaining the \nSpace Stone\n, an enraged 2012 Hulk busted through the door, sending both Stark and the case flying.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark loses the \nTesseract\n after \nHulk\n's punch\n \n \nThe case then popped open and landed at the feet of 2012 Loki, who quickly grabbed the Tesseract and escaped with it. Stark woke up from his sudden knockout, much to his shock from the brute force from Hulk. Lang then jumped onto Stark and told them that part of the plan was not supposed to happen, leading him to tell Lang that they messed up the plan. Stark had to go back to the alleyway empty-handed.\n[\n8\n]\nInfiltrating Camp Lehigh\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark admits on the failure of his plan\n \n \n\"Let me tell you.

With only enough \nPym Particles\n for a return journey home, Lang lectured the group that they would not be coming home. Suddenly getting an idea, Stark had an idea of getting more Pym Particles to take back the \nTesseract\n, telling Rogers that it was in a military installation.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark and \nCaptain America\n travel to \n1970\n \n \nStark told Rogers that he did not know the exact date, but he knew where to go but decided to go improvise on which date the Tesseract and Pym Particles were there. Stark began to set up a date as \nApril 7, 1970\n before Rogers entrusted Lang to bring the Scepter to \n2023\n. When Lang told them if they failed, there would not be a way to come back home, Stark dismissed him and began to suit up, leading the pair to travel further back in time to the date that was settled and take the Tesseract that was in possession of \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark prepares to acquire the \nTesseract\n \n \nArriving in 1970 \nNew Jersey\n, Rogers and Stark infiltrated \nCamp Lehigh\n, where they discovered a doorway that was holding information in plain sight. Once Stark looked at the doorway closely, he examined the inner walls with his \nglasses\n, knowing that they could follow them around using the elevator. Stark and Rogers then took the elevator route while a \nS.H.I.E.L.D. worker\n looked over to them suspiciously.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark discovers the \nTesseract\n in a vault\n \n \nOnce Stark wished Rogers good luck as he arrived on the floor that he tracked down, he managed to get inside a facility where the Tesseract had been held through his lenses and eventually found it near a vault. Stark then burned the ridges of the lock with his \narmor's gauntlet\n, began to capture the Tesseract, and put it inside a briefcase that he stole. However, in the attempt, Stark ran into the \n1970 version\n of \nhis father\n, who was looking for \nArnim Zola\n. Once Howard started asking questions, Stark told him that he was a visitor from \nMIT\n, covering up his identity as \"Howard Potts.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to his \nfather\n from the past\n \n \nDespite Stark's success in stealing the \nSpace Stone\n, Howard engaged his alternate son in conversation, leading them to take it by going outside. While Rogers worked to obtain more Pym Particles from the 1970 version of \nHank Pym\n, Stark talked to his alternate father about the flowers he was carrying, being noted that Howard's \nwife\n was expecting a gift from him after working so long and that a child was coming along.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark talks to \nHoward\n about his experiences\n \n \nOnce outside with his alternate father, Stark was told that Howard's baby would be called Almanzo, much to Stark's surprise, and said to take his time. Howard asked his alternate son if he was nervous when his child was born, responding that he did, in fact. As Howard followed up with further questions, Stark told his alternate father that he just raised the kid as what he learned from his father, as they shared their experiences with their childhood. Stark then went on to talk about what he learned from his father, telling him that no amount money had bought a second of time.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finally reconciles with \nhis father\n \n \nAs they both had reconciled each other's fatherhood, Stark noticed Rogers by the base and noted that he had the Tesseract locked up in the briefcase. With his alternate father ready to leave, Stark told him that it was great meeting him before hugging, much to Howard's confusion. Stark clarified to thank for what he had done for his country and proceeded to leave the camp, finally getting to reconcile with his alternate father. With the tools to get back home, Stark and Rogers traveled back to \n2023\n.\n[\n8\n]\nDeath of Natasha Romanoff\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark safely comes back to the present\n \n \n\"Do we know if \nshe\n had family?\"\n\"Yeah. \nUs\n.\"\nTony Stark and \nSteve Rogers\n[src]\nThe entire team of \nAvengers\n had now escaped from the past and had retrieve each individual \nInfinity Stone\n. Once Stark had arrived back from \n1970\n, \nHulk\n made a brief statement on making sure if anybody had all of the stones. Upon arriving in the present, however, Stark learned that \nNatasha Romanoff\n \nsacrificed\n herself on \nVormir\n in \n2014\n so that \nHawkeye\n could obtain the \nSoul Stone\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark sadly asks about \nBlack Widow\n's family\n \n \nStark, along with the rest of the Avengers, took a moment of silence once Barton had told the rest of Romanoff's death. After the team had mourned Romanoff's death, they headed on by the lake and Stark asked Rogers if Romanoff had any family, to which Rogers told him that the Avengers were the only family she had ever gotten. Despite of the team's assurance, \nThor\n was in denial that Romanoff was fully gone, leading Stark to tell him that he just asked a question.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark listens to \nHulk\n's plan\n \n \nStark witnessed Thor ranting about getting her back by using the Infinity Stones; however, Barton argued against him, considering that the sacrifice could not be undone. While Hulk was listening, he angrily threw a bench, and Stark listened on as Hulk claimed that they would have to not let Romanoff's sacrifice be in vain, before proceeding with their plan to use the stones to bring back the victims of the \nSnap\n.\n[\n8\n]\nAssembling the Infinity Stones\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finishes building the \nNano Gauntlet\n \n \n\"Everyone \nThanos\n snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nTony Stark and \nHulk\n[src]\nWith help from \nRocket\n and \nHulk\n, Stark forged the \nNano Gauntlet\n, capable of harnessing the power of the six \nInfinity Stones\n. Once Stark precisely moved all the Infinity Stones with his holographic tech and successfully finished putting them on the Nano Gauntlet, he was completely shocked and happy to finish, before \nRocket\n had startled him.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tells \nThor\n to not use \nNano Gauntlet\n \n \nAfter settling the gauntlet down on a table, Stark noticed that \nThor\n volunteered to bring everyone back from the dead, only to be stopped on his tracks. While Thor had to explain to the team that he felt responsible to save the universe, Stark understood his reasoning but noted that Thor was in no critical condition. Hulk then volunteered to wield the gauntlet, noting what \nThanos\n did with the Infinity Stones, which almost killed him and that none of them could survive.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man protects himself from the energy\n \n \nIt was decided that Hulk would be the one to wield it, and Stark specified that Hulk bring back the victims of the \nSnap\n to \ntheir present\n and not change anything else, fearing that his \ndaughter\n would no longer exist. After Stark told \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to \nlock down\n the \nAvengers Compound\n, he watched Hulk put on the Nano Gauntlet and initially struggled to wield the Infinity Stones, while the version of \nNebula\n from \n2014\n modified the \nQuantum Tunnel\n to allow \n2014 Thanos\n and his forces to arrive in 2023.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark uses coolant blasters for \nHulk\n's arm\n \n \nDespite the immense pain that he suffered due to his use of the stones' raw energy, Hulk was then able to snap his fingers, but fell to the ground unconscious shortly after doing so. Stark used his \nsuit\n to cool down Hulk's scorched arm as \nAnt-Man\n saw several birds suddenly appear out of nowhere, while Barton received a call from his \nwife\n who had initially perished in the Snap, indicating that Hulk was successful in \nreversing\n the \nSnap\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark quickly recovers from the destruction\n \n \nDespite their victory, however, the \nAvengers\n were unable to celebrate as 2014 Thanos' ship, the \nSanctuary II\n, had arrived in 2023 and \nopened fire\n on the Avengers seconds later, burying the Avengers Compound in rubble and leading \nWar Machine\n, Hulk, Barton, and Lang to be trapped inside while Stark, \nSteve Rogers\n, and Thor stayed on top. Once Stark survived the rubble, he walked towards Rogers' unconscious body on the ground and woke him up, giving back his \nShield\n. As Rogers questioned on the situation, Stark grimly commented that messing with something like time had a strong chance to cause backlash.\n[\n8\n]\nThanos' Offensive\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nStark decides to confront \nThanos\n in a fight\n \n \n\"You know it's a trap, right?\"\n\"Yeah. I don't much care.\"\n\"Good. Just as long we're all in agreement Let's kill \nhim\n properly this time.\"\n\nThor\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nAfter the \nSnap\n was undone, Stark, \nCaptain America\n, and \nThor\n discovered \nThanos\n from the alternate \n2014\n, who was fully aware of his plan's success and his \nfate\n, had arrived on \nEarth\n. Stark asked Thor what Thanos had been doing, to which he was doing nothing. As Rogers asked Stark where the \nInfinity Stones\n were, he noted that they were underneath the rubble.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark personally confronts \nThanos\n outside\n \n \nThor told the group that his arrival could be a trap, but Stark admitted he could not care less. After Thor understood their agreement, Thor summoned his \narmor\n and wielded both \nStormbreaker\n and \nMjlnir\n while he, Captain America and Stark confronted Thanos, who was sitting and waiting for them. As the three walked over to confront Thanos, Stark listened to his lecture about how they could not live with their failure and realized that there were those that remembered what was, who were unable to accept what could be, much to Stark's agreement as he gloated on their stubbornness to Thanos.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man swiftly fighting against \nThanos\n \n \nThanos, having seen the files from his \nNebula\n's memory and now believing that the universe would be ungrateful for \nhim\n \"correcting\" it, had decided on a new plan to decimate the entire universe and start over with no one remembering the massacre. Stark watched with fury as the Mad \nTitan\n proclaimed his new goals, knowing that his universe would be born out of blood before Thanos threatened to kill him and the team. The four engaged in a fight, having Iron Man to equip his hidden blade from his hand and start blasting Thanos with his repulsors.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man shoots repulsor beams at \nThanos\n \n \nIron Man then used his extra repulsors from his back and told Thor to blast his lightning from behind, in order to increase the amount of fire power. As Thor began to charge up his lighting powers, Stark was immediately blasted with huge amounts of energy that powered up his suit, aiming at Thanos for an attack. Thanos blocked Iron Man's beams with his \nDouble-Edged Sword\n and, as he grew closer, broke out of the laser.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man is knocked out from the battlefield\n \n \nThanos used this opportunity to grab Iron Man with both his hands only to witness Thor using Stormbreaker to hit Mjlnir, which he then used Iron Man as a human shield to knock him down and flew him across the field. After he rolled all over the ground, Iron Man was quickly hit by a near pile of rubble which had briefly put him in an unconscious state, becoming stalemated from the fight then on. The other \nAvengers\n had to fight Thanos without Stark, leading to one of them getting beaten relentlessly.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark witnesses his allies coming back\n \n \nWhile Captain America tried to fight Thanos with all his might, Thanos eventually gained the upper hand and called out his entire army to the ground such as the \nBlack Order\n, \nChitauri\n, and the \nOutriders\n. Captain America stood up against Thanos' giant army alone until \nDoctor Strange\n arrived with the reinforcements to battle Thanos' army. Stark then woke up from his concussion and witnessed his allies coming back from the dead, including \nPepper Potts\n in her \nIron Suit\n.\n[\n8\n]\nBattle of Earth\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man joins the battle with his allies\n \n \n\"You said one out of fourteen million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.\"\n\"If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.\"\n\"You better be right.\"\nTony Stark and \nDoctor Strange\n[src]\nWith the rest of the \nAvengers\n in place with all of their allies and other worlds had gathered around to battle \nThanos\n' army, Iron Man dropped down to line up with them as they all began to prepare for battle. Stark landed closely with his teammates and noticed \nCaptain America\n holding \nMjlnir\n, assembling the team to fight for their \nplanet\n.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights alongside \nRescue\n \n \nThe entire team and other forces began to charge with fury attentions, running towards Thanos' forces as he sent his \nBlack Order\n, \nChitauri\n army, \nSakaaran\n army, and the \nOutriders\n to kill them all. Iron Man flew across the battlefield with his allies and began to use his unibeam to attack any nearby threats. Iron Man then teamed up with \nRescue\n, his wife, who was donning her own \nIron Armor\n, and fought alongside each other in aerial combat.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man fights against a horde of \nOutriders\n \n \nWhile attacking the many Outriders that were trying to kill him from above, Iron Man landed on the ground and blasted many incoming Outriders with his laser beams. While successfully winning his fight, Iron Man was then attacked by \nCull Obsidian\n, landing onto a piece of rubble after getting knocked down. Iron Man tried to kill Obsidian with his repulsors but was proven to be ineffective. Iron Man was then saved by \nSpider-Man\n, who pulled Obsidian down onto the ground with usage of his \nWeb-Shooters\n, allowing \nAnt-Man\n to crush Obsidian to death.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man finally reunites with \nSpider-Man\n \n \nStark removed his own helmet to catch his breath after being almost killed, only for Parker to give him a hand while he was on the ground. Parker told Stark about himself being in space and was turned into dust moments when he passed out. Parker further noted that \nDoctor Strange\n was there with him on \nTitan\n and began to wake him up to tell the rest that they would need him. Stark, who happily grew closer to Parker after listening to him again, silently told the boy to hold him and hugged him afterwards during the battle that was going on.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark asking \nDoctor Strange\n if they will win\n \n \nStark flew over to Doctor Strange, who was bringing down a group of Thanos' forces into another dimension during the battlefield, and asked him whether this was the one the fourteen million futures that they would win. Strange told him that if Stark knew what needed to happen, it would not happen. Much to his skepticism, Stark decided to keep being optimistic and told Strange that he hoped that he was right about the outcome. Shortly after Thanos' airstrike on the battlefield, \nCaptain Marvel\n destroyed the \nSanctuary II\n, much to Stark's surprise.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark finds the \nNano Gauntlet\n \n \nUpon Captain Marvel retrieving the \nNano Gauntlet\n from Spider-Man, she lost the item in an explosion, which landed on the ground. After discovering the Nano Gauntlet in front of him, Stark prevented Thanos from getting the Gauntlet by tackling him, only to be knocked down and stalemated once again. While Stark rested for a while, he was knocked out. \nThor\n, \nCaptain America\n, and Captain Marvel tried to kill Thanos, only to fail due to his fighting powers.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man realizes the winning outcome\n \n \nAfter recovering from his knockout, Stark turned to Strange, who, visibly shocked, signaled to him that this was the one timeline he foresaw where they won. Finally realizing why Strange sacrificed the \nTime Stone\n \nfive years ago\n to save his life and what had to be done, Stark briefly grabbed Thanos' arm, clinging onto the Nano Gauntlet, but was knocked to one side. Thanos triumphantly declared himself inevitable, before snapping his fingers once more.\n[\n8\n]\nSelf-Sacrifice\n[\n]\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man wields all six of the \nInfinity Stones\n \n \n\"I am inevitable.\"\n\"And I am Iron Man.\"\n\nThanos\n and Iron Man\n[src]\nDespite seemingly having won over the fight for the \nNano Gauntlet\n, nothing happened when \nThanos\n snapped his fingers. Once Thanos looked over to Stark, he revealed to Thanos that he had transferred all six \nInfinity Stones\n to his \nIron Man Armor\n, much to Thanos' horror of this discovery.\n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man wipes out \nThanos\n and his armies\n \n \nStark bonded all six Infinity Stones onto the knuckles of his hand and felt the energy surging onto his body. Once he had all of the Stones at his disposal, Stark looked over to Thanos again and replied to him by declaring that he was Iron Man before taking a long, deep breath. Stark snapped his fingers at Thanos. As he watched, all of his surrounding troops and armies turned into dust and, accepting his inevitable defeat, sat down and crumbled into ash.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark tries to relax as he is being found\n \n \nSince he was merely a mortal man wielding the powers of the universe, the devastating force of the snap charred the right side of Stark's face and body. Stark collapsed among the debris of the \nAvengers Compound\n. The physical toll from the \ngamma radiation\n and the raw energy from the Infinity Stones were too much for him to endure. \nWar Machine\n met up with Stark and discovered that he was seriously injured from the Stones moments before \nSpider-Man\n arrived.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark smiles at \nPepper Potts\n for her arrival\n \n \nParker tried to speak to Stark while he was slowly resting and began to feel pain. After being told that they won the battle, Parker was taken away by Rhodes, leaving \nPepper Potts\n to try to speak to him. Stark softly uttered a greeting to Potts as his last words, having her ask \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n to check his vitals. Potts told Stark that he could rest now, as he began to smile at her before he died. Holding Potts' hand, Stark looked over to his right, leaving his \nArc Reactor\n to lose its power.\n \n \n \n \n \nStark slowly passes away from his sacrifice\n \n \nOnce the Iron Man Armor was deactivated, Stark died in peace with his sacrifice, surrounded by Potts, War Machine, and Spider-Man, with \nThor\n and \nCaptain America\n looking onward, all devastated and honored by Stark's selfless act to save the universe.\n[\n8\n]\n The \nAvengers\n, \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, and \nCaptain Marvel\n all took a knee to honor the legacy of Stark and his righteous sacrifice.\n[\n61\n]\nLegacy\n[\n]\nFuneral and Tributes\n[\n]\n\"This \ntime travel\n \nthing\n that \nwe\n're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. But then again, that's the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end. What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to. I love you 3000.\"\nTony Stark to \nMorgan Stark\n[src]\nStark's sacrifice saved \nEarth\n, therefore ensuring the continued survival of all living creatures in the known universe. However, his death profoundly impacted his friends and family. Many of Stark's closest friends were most clearly affected, having witnessed Stark's death firsthand, as they had most defining relationships with him. A week after his death, Stark's message to his \nwife\n and \ndaughter\n, which he recorded prior to executing the \nTime Heist\n in the event of his death, was shown to them in the presence of \nHappy Hogan\n, \nJames Rhodes\n, \nSteve Rogers\n, \nBruce Banner\n, \nThor\n and \nClint Barton\n, all of whom Stark considered close family.\nStark's funeral was held at the \nStark Eco-Compound\n where he was mourned by his family, the \nAvengers\n, \nGuardians of the Galaxy\n, \nDoctor Strange\n and \nWong\n, \nthe\n \nPym-van Dyne\n \nfamily\n, \nT'Challa\n and his \nsister\n and \ngeneral\n, \nNick Fury\n, \nMaria Hill\n, \nThaddeus Ross\n, \nMay Parker\n, Barton's family, and \nHarley Keener\n. Stark's original \nArc Reactor\n, the one gifted to Potts as \"proof Tony Stark has a heart,\" was placed on a wreath, which was set adrift on the lake.\nAfter the funeral, Hogan asked Morgan if she was hungry, to which she answered she wanted a cheeseburger. Remembering Stark's first request upon his return to the \nUnited States of America\n from \nAfghanistan\n,\n[\n3\n]\n Hogan promised to take care of Morgan in her father's absence by giving her all the cheeseburgers she wanted.\n[\n8\n]\nWorldwide Impact\n[\n]\n\"Everywhere I go, I see his face. And the whole \nworld\n is asking who is gonna be the next Iron Man, and I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.\"\n\"You're not Iron Man. You're never going to be Iron Man. Nobody can live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did, he was all over the place. The one thing he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would've done \nwhat he did\n if he didn't know that you were going to be here after he was gone.\"\n\nPeter Parker\n and \nHappy Hogan\n[src]\nThe worldwide impact and outpouring of grief over Tony Stark's death was massive. Across the world, Stark's memory and legacy that he left behind as an \nAvenger\n was memorialized, notably in various forms of artwork, media, and merchandising. Murals commemorating Stark were found in cities such as \nNew York\n, \nVenice\n and \nPrague\n. One such tribute was \nHeart of Iron: The Tony Stark Story\n, a biographical film about Stark and his legacy made shortly after his death.\n[\n7\n]\n Another tribute was established at the \nNew Jersey AvengerCon\n, where Stark and Romanoff were given a memorial in recognition of their sacrifice.\n[\n62\n]\n A girl named \nRiri Williams\n adopted the name \"Ironheart\" after creating \nan armor\n of her own based on Stark's work.\n[\n63\n]\nIn particular, the void that Stark left as the world's most renowned superhero led to speculation as to who would succeed him, which \nQuentin Beck\n had \nsought to exploit\n. \nPeter Parker\n, Stark's protg, did his best to live up to his mentor's reputation, although \nHappy Hogan\n stated that no one, not even Stark himself, could live up to his name. Stark's necessary arrangements to anoint \nSpider-Man\n as part of his legacy were accomplished a \nyear\n after his death when his \nglasses\n, outfitted with the \nE.D.I.T.H.\n which stood for \"Even Dead I'm the Hero\" A.I., allowed Parker complete control of \nStark Industries\n weapons, drones, inventions, and the ability to hack any electronic device. \nNick Fury\n, who had decided to take a vacation, instructed \nTalos\n to impersonate him and deliver the glasses to Parker.\n[\n7\n]\nAfter Parker's identity as Spider-Man was revealed to the world by Beck as revenge, one of the articles to be released during this time mocked the idea he could live up to Stark, dubbing him \"Iron Man Jr.\" Although \nMatt Murdock\n was able to get the legal charges against the teenager dropped, Parker's reputation was ruined, with the public split into pro-Spider-Man and anti-Spider-Man groups. Murdock also noticed that Hogan was eager to defend Stark's legacy but warned him that he would need a lawyer amid an investigation into missing Stark technology. After \nMay Parker\n's death and the end of the \nSpider-Man Multiversal Crisis\n, with knowledge of Parker wiped from the world to end the crisis, Parker met Hogan by May's grave, where Hogan reflected on how he had lost both Stark and now May. Inspired by his conversation with Hogan and other experiences, Parker continued his life as Spider-Man all by himself without Stark to help him.\n[\n64\n]\nPersonality\n[\n]\n\"You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?\"\n\"You're gonna kill yourself, Tony. I'm not gonna be a part of it.\"\n\"I shouldn't be alive unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.\"\nTony Stark and \nPepper Potts\n[src]\nThis section needs a \nrewrite\nMany people in the media thought that Tony Stark was only just an egocentric playboy. His wealth, power, and natural charm allowing him to get just about any woman he wants. But despite his rather carefree and overly confident personality, inside Stark's heart lay loneliness, as \nHo Yinsen\n aptly described him as: \"A man that has everything, but has nothing.\" Even following his reformation and birth as Iron Man, this stigma surrounding Stark persisted as many were quick to point fingers at him believing his arrogance and callous attitudes were the cause of many problems even if he would have only a tenuous connection to the issue at hand.\nBefore his \nkidnapping\n, Stark was a self-centered, arrogant person, caring for few people outside his closest friends. Even during this period of his life, he had a moral code believing the weapons he developed were being used exclusively by the United States and its allies for peaceful purposes, being appalled to discover that they were being sold on the black market. He also funded large humanitarian inventions and programs via his arms dealings, something he felt justified manufacturing weapons.\nDuring the following years, however, Stark matured, gradually becoming more of a team player and less arrogant and cynical. He even began opening up and having a real relationship with \nPepper Potts\n. Stark's exploits as Iron Man have led him to reevaluate his life, thus he now strives to use his inventions in a more responsible and considerate way. A textbook example of a Byronic hero, he never fully let go of his character flaws, however, using them to push him forward as a reminder to do better and often making self-deprecating jokes or comments. Despite this attitude, Stark is an exceptionally brave and selfless individual as shown when he single-handedly faced a near-omnipotent \nThanos\n armed with nothing but a knife without hesitation, a trait that earned him the \nTitan\n's genuine respect as a hero.\nHis experiences while imprisoned by the \nTen Rings\n, especially his injury and seeing his weapons being used by terrorists, hardened Stark into a brave, determined, and somewhat ruthless fighter. Seeing firsthand how innocent people were being harmed by his weapons and business while he remained ignorant greatly enraged him, resulting in him being uncaring in killing his foes, though he avoided doing so when he could. He was also willing to kill to protect his allies and friends, boldly saying he would kill \nDrax\n if \nStar-Lord\n killed \nSpider-Man\n. Despite this, he was not merciless, as he offered several of \nAldrich Killian\n's men a chance to stand down, allowing the sole survivor to leave peacefully upon doing so. Even when confronted by Captain America's betrayal, he offered the man several chances to step aside.\nEven after starting a new life as a superhero, Stark kept his sense of humor and his penchant for showmanship, the latter being demonstrated in his armor's red and gold color schemes, and in revealing his identity in public despite being told not to. Tony has also shown a strong liking towards heavy metal and rock music groups like \nBlack Sabbath\n, \nAC/DC\n, and \nQueen\n. He also shows signs of being a gearhead owning and modifying several expensive cars, having a particular liking towards the Audi R8 model line.\nStark was also known for being exceptionally intelligent, innovative and resourceful, having built a miniaturized \nArc Reactor\n from scratch in \nAfghanistan\n. His intellect earned him the \"Da Vinci of Our Time\" nickname, and his inventions of \nStark Industries\n have revolutionized technology for mankind. His past as a businessman had turned him into a very pragmatic individual always taking the quickest, most efficient way out of a problem commenting to \nCaptain America\n that he would simply \"cut the wire\" when given the scenario of laying on barbed wire to let others cross it. This behavior put him at odds with the majority of the Avengers during the \nAvengers Civil War\n, as they were unwilling to compromise and negotiate with the United Nations regarding the \nSokovia Accords\n which Stark viewed as the easiest way to continue the Avengers' mission of saving people and appease the public's growing fear and unease regarding the team. As a result of this negotiator attitude, Tony was one of three Avengers to not become a fugitive by the end of the Civil War and allowed to continue saving people with the support of the \nUnited Nations\n. This pragmatism extended to his fighting style, as he was quick to shift over to weapons more suited to the situation or having \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n scan Captain America's fighting style for openings to predict and exploit. He further displayed his combative pragmatism during the \nBattle of Titan\n by first restraining the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n before unleashing an unrelenting barrage on Thanos.\nStark could also be a reliable friend, and occasionally showed affection toward his teammates. Hence, Stark was the only Avenger who encouraged \nBruce Banner\n to embrace his identity of \nHulk\n as a blessing rather than a curse, and trusted him to make good use of Hulk's powers. He has also adopted a mentor role towards \nPeter Parker\n, seeing himself in the young hero, and helping him become better by designing an advanced \nSpider-Man Suit\n and quietly teasing him about his aunt \nMay Parker\n, whom Stark considers attractive, Tony was in fact the only Avenger who believed in Parker and sought out his aid. When Tony was caught up by the terrifying vision of \nWanda Maximoff\n, he was possessed and haunted with great fear of losing all his fellow \nAvengers\n while he could have done something to save them, and having to live on after they had all been murdered, which was the primary motivator of him starting the \nUltron Program\n. During the \nAvengers Civil War\n, however, Tony became distant and hardened towards his former teammates, especially \nCaptain America\n, for their unwillingness to negotiate or hear the other side's arguments, though he still cared for them. When \nthey fought in Siberia\n, Tony tried to avoid hurting Rogers, who aggressively protected \nBucky Barnes\n, destroying Tony's arc reactor to do so. Both Stark and Rogers never fully lost their trust in each other, though when they reunited, Stark mercilessly held the rogue Avengers responsible for the schism that had divided the team and left Earth unprepared for Thanos, noting that they had ignored his warnings and obstructed his desire to prepare. Five years later, however, Stark abandoned this attitude, noting that resentment was \"corrosive\" and not a feeling he enjoyed.\nAfter the \nBattle of New York\n, Stark developed a strong fear, that in this new world of \"\ngods\n\" and \"\naliens\n,\" he would be unable to protect the ones he loves, which induced him to become paranoid and full of anxiety, which, in turn, influenced Stark to build the first \nIron Legion\n, and then the \nUltron\n AI, so that the only threats against Earth were from Earth itself. His fear gave him something of a perfectionist personality and caused him to so intently focus on issues and problems that he unconsciously ignored other matters around him which led to a strain in his relationship with \nPepper Potts\n and his somewhat negative reputation in the Avengers.\nCompared to his fellow \nAvengers\n, however, Tony was very forward-thinking, always seeing a \"big picture,\" willing to take risks, compromise his morals and dabble in shades of gray to achieve results. As seen with the \nSokovia Accords\n, Stark was willing to endure hardships in the present to build a better future. He was also confident of his ability to negotiate, a belief supported by him negotiating a deal that would have made the \nCapture of Winter Soldier\n legal, though he knew that this talent had its limits, expressing regret that he could do nothing to free the rogue Avengers from the Raft. This more nuanced behavior often put him at odds with his fellow Avengers, especially \nCaptain America\n, who were content with the status quo. Combined with his unpredictability, some people such as \nWanda Maximoff\n thought he was destructive, with her believing that \nUltron\n's inability to distinguish between saving the world and destroying it comes from Tony.\nDuring times of great stress and frustration, Stark could become very short-tempered and intolerant of those whom he considered his intellectual inferiors for delaying a solution to the problem either mocking/berating them or ignoring them entirely. This behavior extended to both allies and foes.\nStark was much closer to his mother, \nMaria Stark\n, than to his father \nHoward\n with whom he had mixed feelings for, as he thought he was \"cold and distant,\" which \nNick Fury\n, however, claimed to be false. He still cared for him a great deal as he wished he could've said goodbye. While he was researching a \nnew element\n for his Arc Reactor, Tony came across a message left by Howard, telling his son that his greatest creation was him.\nThough having learned more of Howard's flaws and shortcomings, Stark still retained lingering issues with his father using his parenting as an excuse for being such a strict mentor to \nSpider-Man\n. He was aware of this flaw, however, and consciously attempted to grow out of it. During the \nTime Heist\n, after talking with his alternate father \nHoward\n and realizing how difficult it was for Howard to raise him due to having an abusive father as well and having had experiences as a father, Tony finally came to reconcile with Howard and even shed his faade temporarily by hugging his father and saying that he loved him.\nFollowing the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Stark adapted into a new role: that of a mentor to the inexperienced superhero, \nSpider-Man\n. He connected with Parker due to the similarities between that of him and Stark, such as their love of science, technology, and heroic deeds, yet Stark was not blind to Spider-Man sharing some of his flaws and does his best to stop him from making the same mistakes Iron Man himself has made in the past. Like most mentors, Stark encourages Parker to be more forward-thinking and imaginative with his abilities while also being conscious of Peter's limitations and wanting to keep him out of fights he felt were too dangerous. Though he could come off as somewhat aloof and detached in his dealings with Spider-Man, this was all done with the intent of making Parker a better superhero than Tony ever was, and after the defeat of \nVulture\n, Stark believed he had succeeded even going so far as to offer the young hero a spot in the Avengers. Some months later, their relationship had strengthened to the point that Stark was openly saddened by Parker's death upon Thanos' completion of the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n.\nThough considered a hobby, obsession or part of his itinerary, Stark considers the relationship between the Iron Man Suit and himself to be symbiotic, in that he and the suit himself are one. By the time of \nAldrich Killian\n's terrorist attack, he had designed 42 variations of the armor as well as having stylized them with their own color designs, personalities, and names. He often referred to his suit as \"he\" when he was remotely controlling it with Potts and exclaimed when the suit's finger was pulled off, claiming it would hurt him. This is further supported during and after the \nAvengers Civil War\n whereupon the armors became incredibly streamlined and were designed to emulate a second skin. However, he does claim after the \nClean Slate Protocol\n, that despite being without his suits he is still Iron Man.\nIn spite of his love of the spotlight, the idea of a normal life intrigued Tony greatly as he made attempts to extradite himself from the Iron Man persona and indeed, prior to his involvement in the \nInfinity War\n, pondered the possibility of he and Pepper having children together. After the disastrous outcome of the Infinity War, Tony indeed decided to retire and marry Pepper, having a daughter called \nMorgan Stark\n. His familial life allowed Tony to find a sense of peace and contentment as a husband and father and this was the primary reason of his refusal to return to being a superhero when presented with a potential chance to undo it all but in the end his guilt over Parker's death allowed him to overcome this and he showed the same amount of selflessness as he had before, willingly sacrificing himself to kill \nThanos\n and his whole army. Despite the agonizing pain he was subjected to as he died, he had accepted his fate, refusing aid and instead finding comfort in the presence of his friends and loved ones, dying with no regrets.\nPowers and Abilities\n[\n]\nPowers\n[\n]\n\"\nThis\n is only a first, crude effort. Stark has perfected \nhis design\n. He has made a masterpiece of death. A man with a dozen of these can rule all of \nAsia\n.\"\n\nRaza Hamidmi al-Wazar\n to \nObadiah Stane\n[src]\nIron Man Armor Capabilities\n: Tony Stark did not possess any innate powers; instead, he used a miniature version of the \nArc Reactor\n to charge the various suits that provided him with superhuman strength, endurance, durability, and a variety of weapons. His original advanced technology combined with his extraordinary intelligence and adaptive combat skills made Tony Stark one of the most formidable superheroes in the \nworld\n. With the exception of the \nMark I Iron Man armor\n, almost all of the \nIron Man suits\n shared a common design and capability set. The suit was a powered exoskeleton with armored plating, capable of enhancing the wearer's strength, speed, agility, and endurance. The suit was powered by a miniaturized Arc Reactor, either using the one surgically installed in Tony Stark's chest or else built into the chest-piece of the armor itself. The original armor Tony Stark created, the \nIron Man Armor: Mark I\n, while in captivity in \nAfghanistan\n was crudely designed and bulky, but still had the necessary capacity to help him escape his captors. Due to its rudimentary design, and Stark's lack of more sophisticated resources, the Mark I did not have an onboard \nAI system\n or augmented-reality (AR) displays like the later armors. The helmet served only as a simple faceplate and was not fully sealed. The later model armors' helmet featured a retractable visor that projected a holographic AR displays to the wearer. The \nMark II\n was built from basic titanium alloys, giving it a silver look. From the \nMark III\n onward, Stark used a gold-titanium alloy to provide the necessary power-to-weight ratio coupled with the ability to resist icing at high altitudes. Until the development of \nMark V\n, Stark focused on refining basic systems shared by all later models, ignoring the ease of putting on and taking off armors, resulting in Mark II, III, and \nIV\n all having lengthy and uncomfortable suit-up and suit-off periods. Stark designed and constructed a ring specifically for easily donning and taking off his \nMark VI armor\n until he can finally solve the issue without compromising on functionality. It wasn't until the \nMark VII\n that the issue was finally resolved, through enabling armors to move in one whole set on its own without the user in it, and open up to fit the user inside when needed, allowing Stark to don his armor within seconds for the first time. This culminated in the \nMark L\n, which used nanotechnology to seamlessly materialize the armor over Stark. He frequently improved the technology put into his armors, giving them upgrades for battles and to perfect the onboard systems. He had created a collection of suits for him to choose from; some are mission-specific or prototypes for testing out various capabilities, others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research. The Iron Man Armor is arguably one of the most powerful man-portable weapons on the planet.\nSuperhuman Strength\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man overpowering \nHulk\n \n \n When inside the armor, Tony's physical strength was amplified, allowing him to lift great amounts of weight. With his \nfirst suit\n, he could lift 900 pounds.\n[\n65\n]\n Even while wearing early models, Stark could send fully grown men flying with his strikes, break down metal doors and punch through stone and concrete. Most armors were strong enough to lift and bench press tanks, \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \nLifeboats\n or cars. Iron Man was also able to fight \nUltron\n's second robotic body, and when his strength was temporarily boosted by \nMjlnir\n's lightning, it increased his suit's power to over four hundred percent capacity. Iron Man was able to hold his own against the mighty Asgardian \nThor\n himself. When in his \nHulkbuster armor\n, he was able to go toe-to-toe with \nHulk\n. A unique feat of strength was when Iron Man pushed and jump-started one of the rotors of the S.H.I.E.L.D. \nHelicarrier\n while in the Mark VI. With the \nMark XLVI\n, he and \nWar Machine\n were able to knock down \nGiant-Man\n.\nSuperhuman Durability\n: The armor was made up of a strong lightweight Titanium Alloy, with interlocked plates for the shell, and a chest plate protecting the \nArc Reactor\n. It was able to withstand tremendous amounts of punishment. The armor could withstand tank shells exploded in close proximity to Stark, and a resulting fall from several thousand feet up, followed by hits by twenty millimeter Vulcan shells and a high-speed collision with an \nF-22 Raptor\n with only minimal cosmetic damage. It was able to survive a full-on fight with an older generation suit throughout Stark's house, the fights with the \nHammer Drones\n and \nWhiplash\n, and having several cars dropped on top of him by \nWanda Maximoff\n, all of which resulted in taking relatively minor damage. Most of all, it protected the wearer from the effects of extreme g-force. It even allowed him to withstand some of \nThor\n's attacks, although Thor proved he could crush the suit's gauntlet frame with his strength. He was able to withstand the force of a turbine from the \nHelicarrier\n's engines when he got it to work again after removing the debris blocking it. It was also able to withstand a full-on assault from the \nChitauri\n forces' energy weapons. The Mark XLII was able to take damage from having most of Tony's house collapse on him at the bottom of the ocean and being hit by a Mack truck, although, Stark was not in the armor and was instead remote-controlling it.\nSuperhuman Speed\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man catches up to the \nQ-Ship\n \n \n Iron Man's armor has allowed him to reach immense speeds. Even from his third armor, which can fly at 1,500 miles per hour,\n[\n65\n]\n he was able to keep up with an \nF-22 Raptor\n. While he improved his armor, his speed improved. He could move so fast that the wind that his suit generated was powerful enough to move a parked car. When his \nmansion\n was destroyed, his armor was able to fly from \nMalibu\n to \nRose Hill\n, \nTennessee\n in less than 24 hours, while he was unconscious. Separate parts of his armor were also able to fly themselves from Rose Hill to \nAldrich Killian's Mansion\n in \nMiami\n in minutes. In addition, the \nIron Legion\n flew from Malibu to \nFlorida\n in minutes as well. By the \nAttack on Greenwich Village\n, Stark had upgraded his armor by so much that he was able to conjure himself even more powerful thrusters to catch up to the \nQ-Ship\n that was already reaching orbit. While it was never seen, Stark's top speed was greater Mach 5 with the \nMark XIX\n[\n66\n]\n and the \nMark XL\n,\n[\n67\n]\n and the \nMark VI\n's enhanced jet boots could theoretically reach Mach 8.\n[\n68\n]\nSuperhuman Agility\n: Iron Man could use his increased agility very well in battle. He was able to spin around many \nChitauri Chariots\n while shooting at them. He also accurately shot many \nUltron Sentries\n while flying and dodging them. With his advanced combat mode in his armor, he was able to fight \nCaptain America\n as well.\nSuperhuman Stamina\n: Iron Man could fight in battle for more time than any of the \nAvengers\n, showing no signs of fatigue during the \nBattle of New York\n while the super soldier, \nCaptain America\n had to take a short break.\nSuperhuman Reflexes\n: While not on par with that of someone with genuine superhuman speed and reflexes like \nSpider-Man\n, Iron Man's armors nonetheless had motors for movement, and they were extremely fast and responsive both in flight and during combat, even against physically enhanced opponents such as \nCaptain America\n or the \nWinter Soldier\n. The suit's coordination and dexterity allowed the user to easily maneuver themselves and change directions with great ease during flight.\nFlight\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man flying with \nWar Machine\n \n \n One of the armor's most important features was its propulsion system and subsequent ability of flight. The armor could reach speeds as high as Mach 3 in moments. It also had variable control surfaces for active flight control by J.A.R.V.I.S. to automatically stabilize the armor in flight. The armor was able to fly at speeds more than fifteen hundred miles per hour. However, the armor showed it could fly at supersonic speeds at the drop of a hat. By the time of the \nBattle of New York\n, the Mark VII armor's flight system was improved with additional boosters on the back. It enabled the armor to quickly evade enemy attacks, go faster, and also the ability to better maneuver himself and shoot while in flight; due to the fact that he didn't have to use his hands to keep himself stabilized all the time.\nPower Suit\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man shooting multiple repulsor beams\n \n \n The armor had remote assistance from \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n or \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, who managed the armor's systems at Stark's command, and the armor also had a holographic HUD with heads-up displays for navigation, power level, armor status, weapons systems, vital signs with cellphone and computer connections in the helmet, and a built-in loudspeaker. The scanner systems were capable of scanning the environment, weather conditions, and equipment for information. The armor was able to absorb and convert energy sources, such as heat, kinetic energy or energy from the planet itself into electricity, directly into the batteries for recharge. This allows him to charge his suit up higher than capacity and deliver a stronger counterattack. The armor could be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support. It was also shielded against radiation. The Heads Up Display of the Iron Man suit was powered by \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, Stark's artificial intelligence. The Suit also had Defensive and Offensive sections, able to switch around the sections, resorting to missiles and lasers. The HUD could scan people, missile identifications, make calls, use a GPS, and give crucial suit credentials such as power. Thanks to the new repulsor flight system, as well as the magnetic implants embedded in Tony's forearms, individual pieces of later armors could self-assemble themselves onto Tony or others. Iron Man could summon small circular thrusters that could open up and attach to a surface to aid Iron Man in difficult situations. Tony could launch two disc-like projectiles consecutively with retractable metal fibers that could form a powered clamp to bind enemies. It was powerful enough to bind the legs of Captain America. The \nMark XLVI\n armor had the ability to analyze people's specific fighting patterns, and in turn, find a counter to said fighting style which he used on Captain America. Stark's \nfirst Iron Man suit\n had flamethrowers mounted on each arm which he used during his escape from the Ten Rings base, but they didn't make it to future armors. Thanks to micro-repeaters injected into his left forearm, Stark could mentally and remotely control the Iron Man armors beginning with the \nMark XLII\n either as a whole or in pieces with a combination of gestures and thought. This is further augmented by a holographic headset, which allows Stark to see through the Mark XLII's primary camera and allowing for complete remote control of the armor as though he were wearing it. There were particle weapons in the palm gauntlets that fired beams or blasts of concussive and explosive force, allowing them to repel physical and energy-based attacks. Early repulsors needed time to recharge after use, but, because of the new \nArc Reactor\n, later repulsors were able to fire at a moment's notice and with far more controllable degrees of intensity. By the sixth armor, the repulsors could become small laser-like welding beams, which Stark used to install an Arc Reactor for \nStark Tower\n. Later, repulsors became capable of launching targets off their feet without killing them, meaning they could function with intensity low enough to incapacitate and render targets unconscious. By the time of the \nMark L\n and \nMark LXXXV\n, the repulsors could generate energy that could rapidly repel large and heavy targets with ease. A more powerful version of the hand repulsor located in the chest called a Unibeam, which was powerful enough to disintegrate the \nWinter Soldier\n's prosthetic arm. Small anti-personnel guns in the shoulders that could target individual targets at once and fire at a moment's notice. The earliest incarnations of the armor held a multi-fire adhesive grenade launcher in the upper arm. Among the most proficient of the armor's weapon system was the missiles which he first used against a tank sent by the \nTen Rings\n. In later models, the armor had mini-rockets hidden in a secret compartment in the boosters on the back, that blew up numerous \nChitauri\n ships. From the \nMark XLIII\n onward, the missiles used by the armor can explode on impact rather than first attaching to the target, with the launchers for the missiles usually being located on either the arm or shoulder. In response to the \nMark XLVI\n's aiming system being damaged during the \nBattle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility\n, Stark added auto-targeting missiles to his nanotech suits, which he used during the \nBattle of Titan\n. Stark had a powerful weapon in the gauntlet wrists that could cut through any common metal, but was originally a one-time use. He used this during the \nBattle at Stark Expo\n, the \nAttack on the Helicarrier\n, the \nBattle of New York\n, the \nBattle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility\n, and the \nAmbush on MV \nSpirit of America\n. Stark could protrude a hidden blade from the arm of the \nSilver Centurion\n armor, which he used to cut off \nAldrich Killian\n's hand. At the beginning of the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n, Iron Man launched a device that emitted an electromagnetic pulse on a helicopter that prevented \nCaptain America\n and \nWinter Soldier\n from escaping with it. When he upgraded to nanotechnology, Iron Man was able to create many weapons including bigger repulsors, a dagger, a shield, and he could even summon the armor around his body after he incorporated it into his arc reactor. His nanotech suits have no gaps in the armor like the \nMark XLVI\n, through which \nAnt-Man\n was able to infiltrate. Stark upgraded to an energy shield with the \nMark LXXXV\n after \nThanos\n destroyed his nanotech shield on Titan.\nFormer Powers\n[\n]\nNigh-Omnipotence\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man wields all six of the \nInfinity Stones\n \n \n During the \nBattle of Earth\n, Stark managed to steal the \nInfinity Stones\n from the \nNano Gauntlet\n worn by \nThanos\n using the nanotechnology in his armor and use said nanotechnology to create an Infinity Gauntlet of his own to allow him to harness the Stones, thus granting him nearly unlimited levels of power and allowing him to do almost anything he desired with a simple snap of his fingers, as he used the power of all six Stones to wipe Thanos' armies and even Thanos himself out of existence, but this came at the cost of his life as his body could not bear the extreme amounts of energy unleashed by using all six Stones at once.\nDeath Inducement\n: After switching out the \nInfinity Stones\n from the \nNano Gauntlet\n worn by \nThanos\n into his own \narmor\n, Stark shaped an Infinity Gauntlet out of nanotechnology in the armor to safely handle the Infinity Stones. With one snap of his fingers, Stark collectively used the Infinity Stones to decimate all of Thanos' forces and even forcing Thanos to disintegrate into ashes, ending the Mad Titan's existence. However, due to Stark's \nhuman physiology\n, his body could not bear such a taxing use of the Infinity Stones, even with his armor, so the process also ended up fatally wounding Stark.\nAbilities\n[\n]\n\"Yeah. Big man in a \nsuit\n of armor. Take that off, what are you?\"\n\"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.\"\n\nSteve Rogers\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nGenius-Level Intellect\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStark figures out \ntime travel\n \n \n Stark was one of the smartest humans in the \nworld\n, surpassing even his late father, \nHoward Stark\n, while rivaled only by fellow geniuses like \nBruce Banner\n, \nStephen Strange\n, \nHank Pym\n, \nLeo Fitz\n, \nJemma Simmons\n, \nHelen Cho\n, with \nThanos\n, who easily deluded Iron Man into believing Loki was unaided in his invasion while in actuality he had much of his resources from Thanos, and \nShuri\n, the smartest person in the world,\n[\n69\n]\n being the only ones to outclass him. As a result, Stark was known by the nickname \"The Da Vinci of Our Time,\" and despite initially being deemed unfit for the \nAvengers Initiative\n, \nNick Fury\n and \nBlack Widow\n still respected Stark's genius enough for him to be recruited as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. Stark's genius extended to his prolific mechanical engineering, electronic and electrical engineering, scientific, computer, business, strategic, piloting and linguistic skills. Throughout his life, Stark accomplished numerous intellectual feats, such as constructing scores of highly advanced technological exoskeletal armors, figuring out a method for synthesizing a new element, discovering a means of allowing \ntime travel\n through the \nQuantum Realm\n, and outsmarting the past rendition of the Mad \nTitan\n \nThanos\n in battle.\n\"Tony Stark was able to build \nthis\n in a \ncave\n! With a box of scraps!\"\n\"Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.\"\n\nObadiah Stane\n and \nWilliam Ginter Riva\n[src]\nMaster Engineer\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStark creating an Iron Man armor\n \n \n Stark was an extremely talented and prolific engineer and robotics technician, having been able to make many complicated inventions at a young age, building his first circuit board at age four, his first engine at age six and \nDum-E and U\n, his personal lab assistants, during his childhood. He then went on to construct numerous innovative \nStark Industries\n weapons for the \nUS military\n as an adult, most notably the \nJericho\n, as well as leading Stark Industries to become the largest tech conglomerate in the world.\n[\n5\n]\n Even in a cave with very few resources, Stark and \nHo Yinsen\n were able to make the \nIron Man Mark I armor\n and the first miniature \nArc Reactor\n. Indeed, \nObadiah Stane\n's group of well-equipped scientists failed to replicate the miniaturized Arc Reactor, while multiple world governments similarly failed to replicate Stark's Iron Man armors with the \nFeebles\n. He was also able to later program his Iron Man armors to fly to his body and the bodies of others, eventually able to remotely control his armors from vast distances away, via \ntelepresence headset\n. Stark was equally brilliant in software and holographic engineering, with his custom-built \nmansion\n being highly technology-integrated and wired to be run through his personal A.I. assistant, \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n, whom Stark created from scratch. Stark would later go on to create the back-up A.I. systems \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n, \nJ.O.C.A.S.T.A.\n, \nT.A.D.A.S.H.I.\n, and \nKaren\n, in addition to installing the \nTraining Wheels Protocol\n into the \nSpider-Man Suit\n, as well as re-assembling and restoring the memory of J.A.R.V.I.S. after finding the AI's remnants in the \nNEXUS\n world \nInternet hub\n. Moreover, Stark was able to help \nNick Fury\n improve turbines on \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n \nHelicarriers\n, as well as help \nBruce Banner\n construct the \nHulkbuster\n (capable of overpowering and knocking Hulk unconscious, despite the latter's great strength and durability), create the \nUltron\n AI, and download \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n into \nVision\n android. Stark also equipped several of his fellow \nAvengers\n with upgraded weaponry, notably the \nelectroshock batons\n of \nBlack Widow\n, and a new uniform with electromagnetic panels for \nCaptain America\n, to help the latter more easily retrieve his \nvibranium shield\n. Stark similarly equipped \nSpider-Man\n, upgrading his \nWeb-Shooters\n, creating a new \nSpider-Man Suit\n, capable of focusing Peter's superhuman senses, in addition to also eventually creating the \nIron Spider Armor\n for Parker. Even with limited resources and simple hardware store supplies, Stark was able to use them to build a home-made arsenal, with which he infiltrated the \nMandarin\n's mansion. Indeed, Stark was even able to give a lecture on integrated circuits while drunk to the point that most other men, according to \nHo Yinsen\n, wouldn't have been able to stand. Stark was even capable of creating a \nnano-tech version\n of the \nInfinity Gauntlet\n that while not quite equal in terms of durability to the original, was still sufficient to have allowed \nHulk\n to \nundo\n the Snap.\n\"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\"\n\"Last night.\"\n\nMaria Hill\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nMaster Scientist\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStark successfully creates the \nnew element\n \n \n A exceptional scientific prodigy, Tony Stark was ingeniously resourceful, knowledgeable, and brilliant in many different fields of science, particularly physics, but also computer science, chemistry, and neuroscience, having graduated \nsumma cum laude\n from MIT at age seventeen. Hence, he was able to attach an \nArc Reactor\n to his chest in order to save his life, to synthesize a previously unknown \nelement\n discovered by his father \nHoward Stark\n, to understand \nErik Selvig\n's thermonuclear astrophysics notes on the \nTesseract\n overnight, impressing S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director, Maria Hill, and to modify \nMaya Hansen\n's \nExtremis\n formula. Stark, however, notably admitted to \nBruce Banner\n surpassing him in the fields of radiophysics, particle collisions, and bio-organics, although at the same time, Bruce openly acknowledged Stark surpassed him in the field of physics, as in 2023, Stark proved capable of figuring out and creating the blueprints of a time-travel machine, something Bruce failed miserably at and a feat that genuinely surprised him.\n\"At age of 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of \nStark Industries\n.\"\nAward Ceremony\n[src]\nMaster Businessperson\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStark is honored by \nWIRED\n magazine\n \n \n At the age of twenty-one, Stark took over \nStark Industries\n due to his parents' \ndeath\n, thereby becoming the youngest CEO of a \nFortune 500\n Company in history. Since then, Stark helped the company grow, and gain more business partners, with Stark Industries eventually becoming the largest tech conglomerate in the world under his leadership. Stark was therefore extremely well-respected in the business world, able to command people's attention when he spoke on economic matters by virtue of the fact that he was savvy enough to have, over the years, built up Stark Industries into the premier weapons supplier to the US military for years. He was known for having his employees' loyalty, as well as his impeccable business ethics. However, upon his return, he strived to be environmentally responsible in his businesses such as turning away from making weapons. \nNick Fury\n also notably recruited Stark as a business consultant for \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n, which continued until the fall of the agency in the \nHYDRA Uprising\n. Moreover, Stark and the US government would later go on to joint purchase the \nUnited States Department of Damage Control\n, which Stark spearheaded so effectively in all post-battle cleanup, that \nToomes Salvage Company\n promptly went out of business.\n\"I cracked the \nPentagon\n's firewall in high school on a dare.\"\nTony Stark\n[src]\nMaster Hacker\n: Stark was an extremely skilled hacker, as he had managed to crack the \nPentagon\n's firewall on a dare, while still in high school. As an adult, Stark successfully used \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n to hack into the \nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n database and learn of \nPhase 2\n, and, after successfully hacking into the \nNEXUS\n world Internet hub, Stark was able to discover J.A.R.V.I.S.' scattered remnants from all across the Internet.\n\"Stark, we need a plan of attack!\"\n\"I have a plan. Attack.\"\n\nCaptain America\n and Iron Man\n[src]\nExpert Tactician\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man leading his own \nAvengers\n team\n \n \n Stark, while a somewhat brash tactician, every so often made many split-second tactical decisions that either saved people's lives or overpowered his adversaries, though he usually had \nJ.A.R.V.I.S.\n', and later \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n's assistance in this. Notable instances of this include when Stark swiftly saved \nGulmira\n from the \nTen Rings\n, when he defeated \nIron Monger\n with \nPepper Potts\n' covert help, when he had \nWar Machine\n use their combined repulsor blasts to defeat \nWhiplash\n, when he personally relocated a nuclear weapon sent by the \nWorld Security Council\n into outer space destroying the Chitauri Command Center effectively ending their invasion, when he managed to save all falling passengers of \nAir Force One\n, when he and War Machine saved \nMatthew Ellis\n and destroyed the \nExtremis Soldiers\n with the \nIron Legion\n, when he used F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s combat analysis to gain the upper hand against \nCaptain America\n, and also when he promptly saved and fused back together a sinking NYC ferry. In addition, when \nSpider-Man\n was uncertain what to do in the \nAvengers Civil War\n, Stark promptly reminded him of their discussed plan for him. Stark also used his mechanical ingenuity to rectify his mistakes of the past to prepare for the future by upgrading his armors, such as installing a parachute in \nSpider-Man\n's \nsuit\n, a heater after crashing near \nRose Hill\n as well as a GPS tracker after he was \nkidnapped\n by the \nTen Rings\n, and developing a \nnanotechnology suit\n to avoid covert intrusion (after his suit was invaded by \nAnt-Man\n during the \nBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n), which contained larger cannons (after his \nHulkbuster\n Repulsors were ineffective against \nHulk\n during the \nDuel of Johannesburg\n), foot thrusters with greater speed, automatic aim-missiles, flight stabilizers (after his suit was rendered unstable for flight due to receiving a beatdown from the combined efforts of Captain America and \nWinter Soldier\n), and tools to assist in combat, such as battering rams, shields, and blades. Nonetheless, Stark's tactics were usually brash and lacked subtlety, as he mentioned to \nCaptain America\n upon their first meeting that his plan of attack concerning \nThor\n was simply to attack. However, Stark did learn from his mistakes, as he opted to take the \nInfinity Stones\n from the \nNano Gauntlet\n rather than taking the gauntlet itself from \nThanos\n, a course of action that had \npreviously failed\n, and then decimating the Mad Titan's forces, ultimately outsmarting him in the end.\n\"What the hell was that?\"\n\"It's called mixed martial arts.\"\n\nHappy Hogan\n and Tony Stark\n[src]\nExpert Combatant\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nStark fighting against the \nWinter Soldier\n \n \n Stark was trained in unarmed combat by \nPhil Coulson\n and \nHappy Hogan\n, and became quite formidable on his own without the Iron Man armor when the situation demanded it. Hence, he was able to hold his own against \nWar Machine\n, a Lieutenant Colonel Air Force Combat Pilot, during their armored brawl, despite himself being drunk at the time, and ultimately losing the fight. He was also able to battle \nThor\n almost to a standstill for a time while using the \nMark VI armor\n, though only because \nMjlnir\n enhanced the armor to over 400% capacity and Thor was holding back. Stark further refined his hand-to-hand combat skills and became highly skilled in martial arts, being able to take down the guards at \nAldrich Killian's Mansion\n with ease using a homemade arsenal, and defeat the \nExtremis Soldiers\n as well as hold his own reasonably well against \nAldrich Killian\n on the \nNorco\n. He was also able to outfight and ultimately subdue the \nWanda Maximoff\n-controlled \nHulk\n while wearing the \nHulkbuster\n during \ntheir fierce duel\n and easily take out several \nUltron Sentries\n in close combat. Although still outclassed by master level combatants; such as the \nWinter Soldier\n and \nCaptain America\n, Stark proved capable of standing up to them by combining his fighting skills with his ingenuity, as he blinded Barnes before going up against him in hand-to-hand combat and managed to counter and disarm him of his gun and land a single punch but was quickly overpowered and knocked out due to being unarmored and while Stark was wearing his \nMark XLVI armor\n, he was able to repeatedly overtake Winter Soldier and restrain him by using repulsors to enhance his speed and pin him down before he could react, although he got beaten in their last altercation and was able to briefly pummel \nCaptain America\n using the same method and though ultimately pummeled by Rogers, upon using \nF.R.I.D.A.Y.\n's combat analysis and his armor's repulsors combined, he was able to overwhelm Captain America briefly before inevitably being defeated. He was even capable of briefly standing up to \nThanos\n, as he was able to block some of Thanos' attacks and land remarkable blows and get a grip on the Titan using the weapons and repulsors available to his \nnano-tech armor\n, but was ultimately severely outclassed, as he was near entirely unable to defend himself against Thanos' far superior fighting experience in a straight fist-fight and even armed with a sword, he was easily disarmed and stabbed.\nMarksman\n: Although he usually used his armor, Stark proved to be a quite skilled marksman, as he easily wielded handguns to escape from \nA.I.M.\n operatives while not having access to his armor. However, his accuracy and understanding of the guns themselves proved to be limited as Stark didn't understand that the ammunition for his and Rhodes' guns were not compatible and his gunfire only hit a light, apparently by accident. When his armor's targeting systems were inconveniently compromised by \nCaptain America\n, with solely his naked eye, Stark was able to precisely shoot at the hatch's pivot of the \nHYDRA Siberian Facility\n, successfully preventing \nWinter Soldier\n from escaping outside.\nExpert Pilot\n: \n \n \n \n \n \nIron Man demonstrating his flying abilities\n \n \n Stark demonstrated a strong understanding of aerodynamics and aircrafts, allowing him to perform complex maneuvers while flying in the Iron Man armor while being chased by \nF-22 Raptors\n.

Instead, the suits each have their own individual Arc Reactor as seen when Killian damaged the one powering the \nSilver Centurion armor\n and Stark's own Reactor remained unscathed.\nStark's de-aged appearance in \nCaptain America: Civil War\n is based on \nRobert Downey Jr.\n's appearance in the 1987 film \nLess Than Zero\n.\nHawkeye\n mockingly calling Stark \"The Futurist\" is a reference to a studio album that \nRobert Downey Jr.\n made in 2004.\n[\n72\n]\nMethod Man\n mentions Iron Man in his song \"\nBulletproof Love\n\" in the \nLuke Cage\n episode \nSoliloquy of Chaos\n.\nStark has his own flavor of \nBen & Jerry's\n ice cream called \nStark Raving Hazelnuts\n, which \nDoctor Strange\n states as being \"a bit chalky.\"\nStark was 5'9 and weighed 185 lbs.\n[\n9\n]\nArchive footage of Tony Stark from \nIron Man\n was used in the trailers of \nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\n.\nBehind the Scenes\n[\n]\nTony Stark/Iron Man was considered to make his live action debut in \nThe Death of the Incredible Hulk\n. However, his appearance was scrapped along with the idea to introduce \nShe-Hulk\n.\n[\n73\n]\nRobert Downey Jr.\n was uncredited for his appearance in \nThe Incredible Hulk\n.\nBefore Robert Downey Jr. was cast as Tony Stark/Iron Man, \nTom Cruise\n, \nNicolas Cage\n, \nLeonardo DiCaprio\n, \nTimothy Olyphant\n and \nHugh Jackman\n expressed interest or were considered for the role of Iron Man. Cruise, in particular, was going to act in and produce the film until commitments to the \nMission: Impossible\n franchise meant that he couldn't participate. Cage played another Marvel superhero \nJohnny Blaze/Ghost Rider\n in \nGhost Rider\n and was attached to the role. Hugh Jackman was originally offered the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man in \nIron Man\n, but he turned it down in order to star in \nX-Men Origins: Wolverine\n, in the end Robert Downey Jr. was cast instead. According to \nJon Favreau\n, \nClive Owen\n and \nSam Rockwell\n are among the actors that were considered for Tony Stark during pre-production. Rockwell would appear in \nIron Man 2\n as \nJustin Hammer\n.\nFavreau had planned to cast a newcomer in the role but ultimately chose Downey (a fan of the comic) because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part.\n\"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye,\" the director explained. \"He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark. Robert brings a depth that goes beyond a comic book character who is having trouble in high school, or can't get the girl.\" Favreau also felt Downey could make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process. He brought a deeper sense of humor to the film not present in previous drafts of the script.\nRobert Downey Jr. practices the \"Wing Chun\" martial arts style, which Tony Stark also demonstrates in-universe as seen on a training dummy in \nIron Man 3\n and in Stark's unarmored fight against Winter Soldier in \nCaptain America: Civil War\n.\nTony Stark's fondness of hamburgers was requested by Robert Downey Jr., who decided to quit drugs and become sober while eating a \"disgusting burger\" that made him think something really bad was going to happen if not.\n[\n74\n]\nDowney stated that he initially pushed \nJoss Whedon\n to make Stark the lead in \nThe Avengers\n, \"Well, I said, I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, Okay, let's try that.' We tried it, and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and, the theme are the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nA \nbiopic\n of Tony Stark starring \nSimon Williams\n \n \nThroughout \nThe Avengers\n, Stark is seen wearing a \nBlack Sabbath\n t-shirt, a reference to the band's song \"\nIron Man\n\". Despite the fact the song was created with no link to the Marvel comics, the \nIron Man\n film series have often adapted the song to use in film and advertisements.\nActor \nSimon Williams\n portrays Tony Stark in-universe. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n features a poster for a \nbiopic\n of Stark, which is a parody of the poster for the \nDanny Boyle\n film \nSteve Jobs\n, starring \nMichael Fassbender\n in the \ntitle role\n.\n[\n75\n]\nRichard Cetrone\n, \nGreg Fitzpatrick\n, \nMike Justus\n, \nOakley Lehman\n, \nDaniel Stevens\n, \nClay Donahue Fontenot\n, \nGlenn Foster\n, \nPaul Vallespi\n, \nTanner Foust\n, \nTrevor Habberstad\n, \nDouglas Robson\n, \nBen Wright\n, \nKofi Yiadom\n, \nJames Young\n, and \nJohn Flanagan\n were stunt doubles for \nRobert Downey Jr.\n in the role of Iron Man.\nBrian Schaeffer\n was a stand-in for \nRobert Downey Jr.\n in the role of Iron Man.\nReferences\n[\n]\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of images and media related to \nIron Man\n.\nThe \nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki\n has a collection of quotes related to \nIron Man\n.\n\n \nHoward Stark's S.H.I.E.L.D.
