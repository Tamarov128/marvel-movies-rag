He settled on ending the movie with the scene in Oakland both to serve as a book-end and because of its bigger emotional impact.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-alternate-ending-revealed|title=Ryan Coogler Reveals Black Panther’s Alternate Ending|work=CBR.com|first=Tom|last=Chapman|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=21 February 2018}}\n* The wardrobe worn by T'Challa, Okoye and Nakia during their undercover mission in Busan references the colors of the {{WP|Pan-African flag}}. T'Challa is dressed in black, Okoye in red, and Nakia in green. In that very same scene, Ulysses Klaue's vest is blue, representing colonialism.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNHc2PxY8lY|title=Black Panther's Director Ryan Coogler Breaks Down a Fight Scene | Notes on a Scene|work=Vanity Fair|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=21 February 2018}}\n* Mirroring the final scene of the movie, The Walt Disney Company announced that they would donate $1 million to the {{WP|Boys & Girls Club of America}} to help expand their youth STEM programs, which would include a STEM Center of Innovation to be established in Oakland, California.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/extras/news/925705-disney-to-help-open-stem-center-in-oakland-after-black-panthers-success|title=Disney to Help Open STEM Center in Oakland After Black Panther’s Success|work=ComingSoon.net|first=Spencer|last=Perry|date=26 February 2018|accessdate=26 February 2018}}\n* In the film, the people of [[Wakanda]] speak {{WP|Xhosa language|Xhosa}}, one of the real world official languages of [[South Africa]].{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/41684-black-panther-african-language-wakanda-xhosa|title=Why Wakandans Speak Xhosa, an Actual African Language|work=Inverse|first=Eric|last=Francisco|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=2 March 2018}}\n* The scene of the robbery at the Museum of Great Britain was inspired by director Coogler's own visit to the British Museum while in the UK during the press tour for his film {{WP|Creed (film)|Creed}}.{{cite|ref=true|refname=11 Secrets|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/11-black-panther-secrets-ryan-coogler-nate-moore/|title=11 Black Panther secrets from Ryan Coogler and Nate Moore|work=Empire|first=Ben|last=Travis|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}\n* For the mid-credits scene, Coogler and his wife looked into different African proverbs to go with T'Challa's speech. The line of \"In times of crisis, the wise build bridges while the foolish build barriers\" is apparently so ancient that many African tribes claim it.<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* Oakland was chosen as Killmonger's home city to some extent because it was the home of {{WP|Tupac Shakur}}. Coogler specifically noted that \"We wanted to bring the energy of Tupac to a Marvel movie. That's where 'Pac spent a lot of his time, the 'Pac that we know came from his time in the Bay Area. Black people got to California and the Bay Area from repeated migration, fleeing awful things. And that's where you saw these organizations [like the Black Panther Party] come from. They ran out of places to run.\"<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* The death of Ulysses Klaue was written in part a parallel to the search for {{WP|Osama Bin Laden}}, with director Coogler noting that \"What if somebody else brought Bin Laden in instead of Obama? For T'Challa, it's all-important that he gets this guy, it's very important to him, his country. And then somebody else does it and throws it in his face.\"\n* The 2015 black-and-white film ''{{WP|Embrace of the Serpent}}'' helped shape Killmonger's point of view, specifically in regards to Killmonger's connection to Wakanda. As explained by Coogler: \"Killmonger had a connection to Wakanda, but the connection was taken away from him before he could mature. All he really has of Wakanda is his book, his broken ideas of what it is. He adopts things from African cultures, but in a way it's corrupted. Scarification on the continent of Africa is not what you do for killing people, but he's adopted it to that. He has the worst tendencies of both places.\"<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* Black Panther was introduced in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' so that his movie could skip \"all of the origin story pitfalls and just tell a cool story.\"<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* Before it was settled that N'Jobu was going to narrate the prologue, it was considered to have T'Chaka or even Shuri delivering the history of Wakanda.<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* There were two versions of the post-credits scene considered, one in which Bucky sported a new metallic arm. Director Coogler opted to go with the final choice so that Bucky could feel \"more human.\"<ref name=\"11 Secrets\"/>\n* This is currently the highest-rated movie in the MCU on Rotten Tomatoes at 97%. The closest one is [[Avengers: Endgame]], at 94%.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Images===\n<gallery>\nBlack Panther (film) logo.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) logo 002.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 001.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 001 textless.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 002.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 004.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 005.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 006.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 007.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 008.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 009.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 010.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 011.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 012.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 013.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 014.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 015.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 016.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 017.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 018.jpg|Dolby Cinema poster\nBlack Panther (film) poster 019.jpg|IMAX poster\nBlack Panther (film) poster 020.jpg|IMAX poster\nBlack Panther (film) poster 020 textless.jpg\nBlack Panther (film) poster 021.jpg|RealD 3D poster\nBlack Panther (film) poster 022.jpg|International poster\nBlack Panther (film) promo 001.jpg|Black Panther characters\n</gallery>\n===Videos===\n====Trailers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nBlack Panther Teaser Trailer\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Official Trailer\nMarvel's BLACK PANTHER Trailer 3\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Rise TV Spot\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther -- Available May 8\n</gallery>\n====Teasers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMarvel Studio's Black Panther - All-Star TV Clip\nMarvel Studio's Black Panther - King TV Spot\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Entourage TV Spot\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Kinetic Energy Film Clip\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - War TV Spot\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther -- Let's Go TV Spot\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - It's A Set Up\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Pray\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - In 10 Days\nMarvel Studios’ Black Panther – Don’t Miss TV Spot\n</gallery>\n====Featurettes====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - From Page to Screen\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Good to Be King Featurette\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Warriors of Wakanda\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther - Wakanda Revealed Featurette\nMarvel Studios' Black Panther World Premiere Red Carpet\n</gallery>\n| Links                   = *[[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* {{Marvel Cinematic Universe|Black Panther (film)}}\n}}\n[[pl:Czarna Pantera (film)]]\n[[es:Black Panther (película)]]"
