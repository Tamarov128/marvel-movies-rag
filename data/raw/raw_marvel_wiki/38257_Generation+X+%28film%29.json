They recruit [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-700029)|Jubilee]], and introduce her to her fellow students; M, Skin, Mondo, Buff and Refrax. The students are learning to cope with their mutant powers, and come into conflict with the \"townies\" who mock the students. Emma Frost worked previously with a mad scientist named Russel Tresh who felt that he could extract part of mutant's brains to develop psychic powers, and Russell is back and wants to use Skin's brain in his experiments.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nGeneration X - T.V.

The extremely low-budget film was scoffed at by fans and plans to develop a syndicated series were abandoned.\n* [[Arlee Hicks (Earth-700029)|Buff]] and [[Kurt Pastorius (Earth-700029)|Refrax]] were two new characters developed for and introduced in '''''Generation X''''' to replace the characters of [[Chamber]] and [[Husk]]. Husk and Chamber were absent from the film due to budget constraints limiting the special effects required to depicted their powers. Other characters also had the powers altered due to budget constraints.\n* Many fans were disappointed and offended that [[Jubilee]], a Chinese-American character, was portrayed by {{WP|Heather McComb}}, a Caucasian actress. According to an interview with director Jack Sholder, the original script and casting breakdown sent out to agents did not specify an Asian actress for the part of Jubilee.<ref>[http://www.blastr.com/2014-5-27/exclusive-director-jack-sholder-foxs-generation-x-controversial-castings-and-x-men-effect Director Jack Shoulder on FOX's GENERATION X, Controversial Castings and The X-Men Effect]</ref>\n| Trivia                  = * The characters [[Arlee Hicks (Earth-700029)|Buff]] and [[Kurt Pastorius (Earth-700029)|Refrax]] were two new characters developed for and introduced in '''''Generation X''''', while classic [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]] characters including [[Husk]], [[Synch]], [[Chamber]], and [[Penance]] were absent from the film.\n* The real world [[wikipedia:Hatley Park National Historic Site|Hatley Castle]] is the setting for the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and is the same location used in [[Earth-10005|20th Century Fox's X-Men movie franchise]].\n* The ''[[X-Men (1992 video game)|X-Men]]'' arcade game (based on the \"[[Pryde of the X-Men]]\" pilot) was in the background in the ''Generation X'' pilot. The scene where Jubilee was in the arcade room playing ''Virtual Fighter'', her powers activated and Tresh noticed the display. In the background behind Tresh is the arcade game.\n| Links                   = * [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116401/ Generation X on IMDb]\n* [[Marvel Films#Television Films|Marvel Films]]\n* [http://tigrrwildcat.50megs.com/movietv.htm Kindred Spirits - Info, pictures, video and sounds]\n* [http://www.eyrie.org/~frobozz/review/fmgenx.html Fan Review]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/genx1996.htm International Catalogue of Superheroes]\n* [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/amasoni2002/shl/marvel/generation_x_(1996).htm Superhero Lives]\n}}\n[[Category:20th Century Fox]]"
