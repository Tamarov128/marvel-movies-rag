With help from [[Groot (Earth-TRN971)|Groot]], aboard the ''[[Benatar]]'', Star-Lord sends tunes from his [[Awesome Mix]] to the Orchestra's headsets. Star-Lord helps the orchestra play 4 different songs, while Gamora reiterates to him that \"bad music\" is not a serious emergency that warrants their presence. Star-Lord concedes, and begins to leave after the fourth song, but the Orchestra choose to play {{WP|The Jackson 5}}'s {{WP|I Want You Back|\"I Want You Back\"}} without his help. The Guardians stay to watch, but Groot alerts them that a fleet of [[Sovereign Drone Ships]] is attacking the Benatar. The two leave, but Star-Lord tells the Orchestra to choose a new name if they want to become a truly great cover band, and the Orchestra takes the name \"The Star-Lords\" in his honor, before finishing their song.\n\n| Cast                    = \n\n| Notes                   = * The stage show attraction includes covers of five classic rock song including:\n** {{WP|Hooked on a Feeling|\"Hooked on a Feeling\"}} by {{WP|Blue Swede}}\n** {{WP|Come and Get Your Love|\"Come and Get Your Love\"}} by {{WP|Redbone (band)|Redbone}}\n** {{WP|Hit Me with Your Best Shot|\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\"}} by {{WP|Pat Benatar}}\n** {{WP|Don’t Stop Me Now|\"Don't Stop Me Now\"}} by {{WP|Queen (band)|Queen}}\n** {{WP|I Want You Back|\"I Want You Back\"}} by {{WP|The Jackson 5}}\n* Although most songs featured in this stage show were selected from [[Awesome Mix Vol. 1]] and [[Awesome Mix Vol. 2]], neither {{WP|Hit Me with Your Best Shot|\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\"}} by {{WP|Pat Benatar}} nor {{WP|Don’t Stop Me Now|\"Don’t Stop Me Now\"}} by {{WP|Queen (band)|Queen}} were part of the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]] version of these compilations.\n[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy - Awesome Mix Live! 002.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The marquee advertising the Guardians of the Galaxy – Awesome Mix Live! showtimes at the American Gardens Theatre by the Shore]]\n* This attraction operated as a stage show at the American Gardens Theatre in the American Adventure Pavilion in [[Disney World|Epcot]]'s World Showcase.<ref name=\"returning\">{{cite web|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/06/guardians-of-the-galaxy-awesome-mix-live-returns-to-epcot/|title=‘Guardians of the Galaxy – Awesome Mix Live!’ Returns to Epcot|work=Disney Parks Blog|first=Thomas|last=Smith|date=14 June 2019|accessdate=17 Feb 2021}}</ref>\n* This stage show attraction ran from June 9th through August 19th, 2018.
