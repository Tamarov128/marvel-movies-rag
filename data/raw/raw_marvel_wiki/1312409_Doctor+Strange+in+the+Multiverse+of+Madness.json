America Chavez and Defender Strange, an alternate variant of Dr. Stephen Strange, are chased by a monster in the space between alternate universes as they attempt to locate the Book of Vishanti. Realizing that he must sacrifice Chavez so he can take her powers and save the multiverse, he attempts to kill her but is ultimately killed by the monster, while Chavez teleports to Earth-616 alongside his corpse.\n\nStephen Strange sees this in a vision but believes it was a dream. He then attends his ex-fiancée Christine Palmer's wedding, where Palmer tells him their relationship would never work. During the wedding, an octopus demon appears in New York chasing Chavez. With Wong's aid, he saves Chavez and destroys the monster. Chavez then explains that the demons are pursuing her for her powers, as she can travel the multiverse. She also explains that Strange's dream was actually the vision of his alternate self's last moments. Strange discovers witchcraft runes on Defender Strange's corpse and consults Wanda Maximoff, who dreams of her alternate self with her kids Billy and Tommy. However, Strange realizes that she sent the monsters to capture Chavez after being corrupted by the Darkhold so she can kill Chavez, take her powers, and travel to the universe where she can be with her children. She then warns Strange to hand Chavez over at Kamar-Taj by sundown.\n\nStrange, Wong, and the other sorcerers fortify Kamar-Taj as Maximoff attacks. After breaking through the magic shield with her telepathy, she kills many sorcerers as she hunts for Chavez. Strange attempts to trap her in the Mirror Dimension, but fails, and she incapacitates him and Wong before attacking Chavez. Chavez accidentally teleports herself and Strange to Earth-838. They go to the New York Sanctum to find his counterpart but learn he apparently died defeating Thanos. They meet the current Sorcerer Supreme of that universe, Baron Mordo, who invites them to join him for tea, only for him to drug them. Maximoff uses the Darkhold to \"dreamwalk\" into her alternate counterpart in that universe who lives with Billy and Tommy but is stopped when a surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold. As a result, Maximoff forces Wong to take her to Mount Wundagore, the Darkhold's power source, when she threatens to kill other surviving sorcerers.\n\nMeanwhile, Strange and Chavez awaken captured in a facility where they meet that universe's Christine Palmer, a scientist working there. Strange is taken to the Illuminati, an organization formed to protect reality, consisting of Mordo, Captain Carter, King Blackagar Boltagon, Captain Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and their leader, Professor Charles Xavier, who tell him that their universe's Strange, the founder of the Illuminati, used the Book of Vishanti to find alternate ways to defeat Thanos but accidentally caused an incursion that destroyed another universe. After the Illuminati used the book to kill Thanos, Strange voluntarily had himself executed to prevent any more damage to the multiverse. Maximoff uses Mount Wundagore's powers to re-infiltrate her alternate self's body and attack the Illuminati's facility. She kills Boltagon, Richards, Carter, and Rambeau, while Strange fights and defeats Mordo, after Strange goads him into a fight. Xavier attempts to save Chavez from Maximoff by telepathically fighting her but Maximoff snaps his neck and pursues Chavez, Strange, and Palmer into the space between universes.\n\nMaximoff destroys the Book of Vishanti just as Strange reaches it and takes control of Chavez's mind, using her powers to send Strange and Palmer into another universe before returning to Earth-616. Strange discovers they are in an incursion-affected universe where his alternate counterpart, Sinister Strange, has been corrupted by his universe's Darkhold. Strange fights Sinister Strange and ultimately uses magical musical notes to throw him to his death. Strange then dreamwalks into Defender Strange's corpse in Earth-616 with Palmer's aid to save Chavez while Maximoff begins a ritual to steal Chavez's powers. The dark spirits of the Darkhold attack Strange in both universes but Palmer saves the physical Strange while Defender Strange overcomes the spirits. He then reunites with Wong, who was thrown off the mountain by Maximoff, and attempt to save Chavez but is defeated by Maximoff. Strange encourages Chavez to fight Maximoff. After being unable to defeat her, Chavez instead teleports her to Earth-838, where Maximoff attacks her variant to claim her kids. However, when she sees her kids afraid of her, she realizes the destruction she has caused and seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy Mount Wundagore as well as every copy of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse. Before Strange and Palmer return to their universes, Strange admits to Palmer that he always loved her but was too scared to start a relationship.\n\nRepairs to Kamar-Taj begin as Chavez begins training as a sorcerer while Strange repairs the watch Palmer gifted him earlier. However, as a result of studying the Darkhold, he gains a third eye. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress called Clea who tells him that he has caused an incursion in the multiverse and asks him to go with her to the Dark Dimension to fix it.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Benedict Cumberbatch}} as [[Stephen Strange (Earth-199999)|Dr. Stephen Strange]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-TRN953)|Defender Strange (Stephen Strange)]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-TRN954)|Sinister Strange (Stephen Strange)]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-838)|Illuminati Strange (Stephen Strange)]]\n\n* {{WP|Elizabeth Olsen}} as [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-199999)|Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=SDCC 2019|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/sdcc-2019-all-of-the-marvel-studios-news-coming-out-of-hall-h-at-san-diego-comic-con|title=SDCC 2019: All of the Marvel Studios News Coming Out of Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con|author=Marvel|work=Marvel.com|date=20 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019}}\n\n* {{WP|Benedict Wong}} as [[Wong (Earth-199999)|Wong]]{{cite|ref=true|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/benedict-wong-doctor-strange-future-robert-downey-jrs-generosity-1248703|title= Benedict Wong on 'Gemini Man' and His 'Doctor Strange' Future|work= THR|last= Davids|first= Brian|date= October 18, 2019|accessdate= October 18, 2019}}\n\n* {{WP|Rachel McAdams}} as [[Christine Palmer (Earth-199999)|Dr. Christine Palmer]]{{cite|ref=true|url= https://deadline.com/2020/12/rachel-mcadams-doctor-strange-into-the-multiverse-1234651562/|title= Rachel McAdams Returning For ‘Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness’|work= Deadline|last= Kroll|first= Justin|date= December 10, 2020|accessdate= December 10, 2020}}\n\n* {{WP|Chiwetel Ejiofor}} as [[Karl Mordo (Earth-838)|Baron Karl Mordo]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Ejiofor McAdams|url= https://variety.com/2020/film/news/doctor-strange-2-sam-raimi-1203475309/|title= Sam Raimi in Talks to Direct ‘Doctor Strange 2’ (EXCLUSIVE)|work= Variety|last= Vary|first= Adam B.|date= February 5, 2020|accessdate= March 26, 2020}}\n\n* {{WP|Xochitl Gomez}} as [[America Chavez (Earth-TRN952)|America Chavez]]{{cite|ref=true|url=https://deadline.com/2020/10/doctor-strange-2-baby-sitters-club-xochitl-gomez-benedict-cumberbatch-1234598621/|title= ‘Doctor Strange 2’: ‘Baby-Sitters Club’ Star Xochitl Gomez Joins Benedict Cumberbatch In Next Installment|work= Deadline|last= Kroll|first= Justin|date= October 16, 2020|accessdate= October 16, 2020}}{{cite|ref=true|refname=Investor Day |url=https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337196091201253379|title=Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness, debuts March 25, 2022.
