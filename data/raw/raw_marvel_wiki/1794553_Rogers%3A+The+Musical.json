After singing to a poster of {{WP|Uncle Sam}} he is approached by [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-TRN1049)|Dr. Abraham Erskine]] and [[Margaret Carter (Earth-TRN1049)|Agent Peggy Carter]] who determined that Steve's good heart makes him an ideal candidate for his new [[Super-Soldier Serum]]. Steve also finds himself enamored with Peggy. Taken to his lab the Serum is adminstered and the procedure is a success. However, the army puts Steve on tour around the United States as a mascot to sell war bonds (\"Star Spangled Man With A Plan\").\n\nPeggy approaches Steve and tells him that his friend [[James Barnes (Earth-TRN1049)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]] has been captured and command is not planning a rescue. Steve decides to go to the front before the the two promise to have a dance together (\"My First Dance With You\"). Steve fought against the [[Johann Schmidt (Earth-TRN1049)|Red Skull]] [[Hydra (Earth-TRN1049)|Hydra]], forming the [[Howling Commandos (Earth-TRN1049)|Howling Commandos]] and rescued Bucky (\"Star Spangled Man With A Plan (Reprise)\").

This included introducing him to the [[Avengers (Earth-TRN1049)|Avengers]] and other heroes of the Earth.(\"What You Missed\"). After finishing, New York then comes under attack by [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-TRN1049)|Loki]] and the Chitauri which is stopped by Steve and the Avengers.(\"Save The City\"). This is quickly followed by other major incidents such as the attack on [[Sokovia]], the attacks by the Winter Soldier and [[Thanos (Earth-TRN1049)|Thanos's]] attack on [[Wakanda]]. (\"Save the City (Tag)\") Exhausted from this constant barrage, Steve meets an old version of himself, who reveals he has traveled back using the Time Stone. The two discuss their past and future.(\"End Of The Line\"). Before leaving, old steve gives the Time Stone to present Steve who travels back to the 1940's to have his date with Peggy.
