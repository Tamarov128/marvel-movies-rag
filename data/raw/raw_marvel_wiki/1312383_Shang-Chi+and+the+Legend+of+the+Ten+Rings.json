However during this film, even though Xu Wenwu does states that he has been known through the years by many names, he also says that \"The Mandarin\" is a funny name the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-199999)|Americans]] created to put a face to the 10 rings organization, so it is unclear if he truly had been known as The Mandarin in the past.\n** The name Wenwu comes from a {{WP|Wen and wu|concept of Chinese administration and philosophy}}, wen means civilian and wu means military or martial, {{WP|Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin}}, is a term created by the Portuguese to describe a bureaucratic position in China, Korea and Vietnam.\n* The film has had multiple release date changes due to the {{WP|COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic}}:\n** Originally announced to release on February 12, 2021, the film was pushed back on April 3, 2020, along with Marvel's entire Phase Four line-up, to the new release date of May 7, 2021.{{cite|ref=true|url= https://variety.com/2020/film/box-office/disney-mulan-black-widow-release-dates-coronavirus-1203550173/|title= ‘Black Widow,’ ‘Eternals,’ ‘Indiana Jones 5’ and More Disney Films Get New Release Dates|work= Variety|last= Rubin|first= Rebecca|date= April 3, 2020|accessdate= April 3, 2020}}\n** In September 2020, the film was pushed back again to July 9, 2021.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/black-widow-west-side-story-eternals-release-date-delay-1234773491/|title=‘Black Widow,’ ‘West Side Story,’ ‘Eternals’ Postpone Release Dates|accessdate=24 September 2020|last=Lang|first=Brent|coauthors=Rubin, Rebecca|date=23 September 2020|work=Variety}} \n** In March 2021, the film was pushed back a final time to September 3, 2021.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/black-widow-release-date-disney-plus|title=‘Black Widow’ Jumps Into New July Release Date in Theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access|last=Paige|first=Rachel|work=Marvel|date=23 March 2021|accessdate=21 April 2021}}\n* Filming for this film started in February 2020,{{cite|ref=true|url= https://deadline.com/2020/03/shang-chi-director-destin-daniel-cretton-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-says-social-distancing-is-an-act-of-love-for-every-person-1202885191/|title= ‘Shang-Chi’ Director Destin Daniel Cretton Tests Negative For Coronavirus, Says “Social Distancing Is An Act Of Love…For Every Person”|work= Deadline|last= D'Alessandro|first= Anthony|date= March 16, 2020|accessdate= October 24, 2020}} and wrapped on October 24, 2020.{{cite|ref=true|url= https://www.instagram.com/p/CGt_BaoJ76Z/|title= WE.
