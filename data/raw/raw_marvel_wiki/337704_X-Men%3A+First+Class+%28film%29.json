Erik pulls apart a metal gate when the [[Schutzstaffel (Earth-10005)|Nazi soldiers]] separate him from his parents. Seeing this, the Nazi collaborator and secret mutant [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-10005)|Sebastian Shaw]] becomes fascinated by the boy's potential and attempts to get him to move a German coin. When this fails, he has his mother brought in, threatening to kill her if he does not succeed in moving the coin. When this does not work either, he shoots the woman, causing Erik to tear apart the lab in horror. \n\nProfessor [[Charles Xavier (Earth-10005)|Charles Xavier]] and his associate, [[Raven Darkhölme (Earth-10005)|Raven Darkhölme]], are contacted by agents of the CIA to help investigate the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-10005)|Hellfire Club]], a clandestine organization of mutants with suspected criminal operations. The association with the CIA soon brings Xavier into contact with other mutants, including Erik Lehnsherr, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-10005)|Havok]], [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-10005)|Darwin]], [[Henry McCoy (Earth-10005)|Beast]], and [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-10005)|Banshee]].\n\nXavier's mutant group then comes into conflict with the Hellfire Club, which leads to the murder of Darwin at the hand of the Hellfire Club's leader. Xavier resolves to stop the Hellfire Club and begins training his young group in preparation for conflicts to come. During subsequent confrontations with the Hellfire Club, Erik and Charles' views regarding the path of the emerging mutant race diverges, resulting in the end of their friendship and the fracturing of their emerging team. Erik, now going by the name \"Magneto\", leaves the team to form the [[Brotherhood of Mutants (Earth-10005)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], with Darkhölme following him, while Xavier continues to shape the others into a team with a higher purpose: the X-Men.\n\n| Cast                    = \n* {{WP|James McAvoy}} as [[Charles Xavier (Earth-10005)|Professor Charles Xavier]]\n** {{WP|Laurence Belcher}} portrays a 12-year old Charles Xavier\n* {{WP|Michael Fassbender}} as [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-10005)|Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr]]\n** {{WP|Bill Millner}} portrays a young Erik Lehnsherr\n* {{WP|Rose Byrne}} as [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-10005)|Moira MacTaggert]]\n* {{WP|Jennifer Lawrence}} as [[Raven Darkhölme (Earth-10005)|Mystique / Raven Darkhölme]]\n** {{WP|Morgan Lily}} portrays a 10-year old Raven Darkhölme\n* {{WP|January Jones}} as [[Emma Frost (Earth-10005)|Emma Frost]]\n* {{WP|Nicholas Hoult}} as [[Henry McCoy (Earth-10005)|Beast / Hank McCoy]]\n* {{WP|Oliver Platt}} as \"The Man in Black\"\n* {{WP|Jason Flemyng}} as [[Azazel (Earth-10005)|Azazel]]\n* {{WP|Lucas Till}} as [[Alexander Summers (Earth-10005)|Havok / Alex Summers]]\n* {{WP|Edi Gathegi}} as [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-10005)|Darwin / Armando Muñoz]]\n* {{WP|Kevin Bacon}} as [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-10005)|Sebastian Shaw]] \n* {{WP|Caleb Landry Jones}} as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-10005)|Banshee / Sean Cassidy]]\n* {{WP|Zoë Kravitz}} as [[Angel Salvadore (Earth-10005)|Angel / Angel Salvadore]]\n* {{WP|Matt Craven}} as CIA Director John A.

In ''X-Men: First Class'' however, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-10005)|Alex]] is apparently much older than [[Scott Summers (Earth-10005)|Scott]], and no familial relationship between the two is mentioned. However, in ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', they were indeed revealed to be brothers.\n* Sheldon Turner earned a story credit due to the film covering the same setting as his discarded ''X-Men Origins: Magneto'' script. Bryan Singer has stated he never read Turner's screenplay. In turn, the contributions by Josh Schwartz and Jamie Moss went uncredited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/complex-x-men-first-class-182356|title=Complex 'X-Men: First Class' Screenplay Credit Dispute Resolved (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 27, 2011|last=Fernandez | first= Jay A. | last2= Kit | first2= Borys|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Kit | first = Boris | title = 'X-Men: First Class' Writing Credits Appeal Denied |work=The Hollywood Reporter | date = April 29, 2011 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-first-class-writing-183768 | accessdate=May 11, 2011| archivedate= May 31, 2011| archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5z6Tdp8tH | deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\n| Trivia                   = \n*Although it is made clear in the credits and from behind-the-scenes information that the character played by actor Álex González is Riptide, the film makes no mention of this.
