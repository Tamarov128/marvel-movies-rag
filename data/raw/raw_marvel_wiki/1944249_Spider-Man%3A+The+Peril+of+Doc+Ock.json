Parker changes into [[Spider-Man]] and starts to fight Doc Ock. After fighting on a subway train for a bit, the train crashes and falls into a pierside building, causing [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-TRN1504)|MJ]] and [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-TRN1504)|aunt May]] to fly. Parker saves them, and after a brief fight with Ock yet again, Spider-Man saves the day by pushing Octavius into the ocean and short-circuiting his arms. \n\n| Trivia                  =*This short was outsourced to [https://www.spiteyourface.com Spite Your Face Productions] as a form of promotion for {{ml|Spider-Man 2 (film)}} by Sony and LEGO.{{r|https://www.spiteyourface.com/spider-man-the-peril-of-doc-ock/}} The short was supposedly released as a bonus DVD for the film.<ref>https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?G=SpidyDVD#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}</ref>\n**Later, an alternate ending would be released,{{r|https://web.archive.org/web/20050403111345/http://www.spiteyourface.com/spidey.html}} though, this alternate ending was actually the originally intended ending before being changed.{{r|https://spiteyourfaceproductions.tumblr.com/post/113641309578/spider-man-the-peril-of-doc-ock-2004-spite-your}}\n***Both versions would be remastered in 2017.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UD5wYY3zI</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlThxjRyw8s</ref> \n|ProductionCompanies=Spite Your Face Productions}}\n[[Category:Short Films]]"
