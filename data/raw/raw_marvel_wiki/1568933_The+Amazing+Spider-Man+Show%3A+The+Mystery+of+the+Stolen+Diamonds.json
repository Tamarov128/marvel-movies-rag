Spider-Man gets away, planning to defeat Green Goblin and the Street Dance Crew come round 2, but first, as Peter Parker, spends some time with [[Mary Jane Watson]] in [[Central Park]].\n\nMeanwhile, the criminals lay out their plan to steal the Stone of the Universe, a giant diamond stored in the ACME High Security Vault. They plan to kidnap Mary Jane, as she is the star of 'Hot Fever' at the Scala Theatre, and hold her for a ransom by sending a blackmail email to Dan Durando, Eye in the Sky for WNYF Radio, before blowing up the WNYF antenna, so that Durando can't call Spider-Man for help, and the ACME High Security Vault at the same time.\n\nThe villains' scheme goes off without a hitch, but Spider-Man rescues MJ and defeats the Street Dance Crew and the Green Goblin, handing over the Stone of the Universe, and the Green Goblin to the NYPD.\n\n| Cast                    = \n\n| Notes                   = * ''The Amazing Spider-Man Show: The Mystery of the Stolen Diamonds'' was a musical stage show in the Ranger County Arena in [[Wikipedia:Thorpe Park|Thorpe Park]].
