Ferry\n* {{a|[[Quinjet]]}}\n\n| Plot                    = Following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons. Years later, Toomes is an established black market dealer. \n\nPeter Parker is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute, but resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his Queens apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the Washington Monument where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz. Returning to New York City, Parker persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark arrives and helps Parker save the passengers on the ferry. Afterwards, Stark admonishes Parker for his recklessness, reminding him he almost killed dozens of people as well as himself. This also results in Stark confiscating the Spider suit.\n\nParker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is Liz’s father. Deducing Parker's secret identity from Liz's account about him, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz, but defeats him with the help of Ned. At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes, and leaving him for the police along with the plane's cargo. Later, Stark offers Parker an even more advanced suit and an invitation to join the Avengers. Parker declines Stark's invitation in favor of remaining a 'friendly neighborhood' Spider-Man and inspires Stark to bring an engagement ring to a press conference where Pepper Potts is present. Upon returning home, Peter sees a brown paper bag on his bed. He opens it and finds the Spider suit, which he puts on in his bedroom just as his Aunt May walks in.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison. Gargan has heard that Toomes knows Spider-Man's real identity, which Toomes denies.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland}} as [[Peter Parker (Earth-199999)|Spider-Man

The deal with Marvel Studios would allow Spider-Man to exist in and interact with the world of the MCU, while Sony Pictures Entertainment would still finance and distribute any standalone feature of the character (instead of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Marvel's regular film distributor and parent company). Both Marvel Studios President of Production Kevin Feige and Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal would serve as producers on the solo film. The incarnation of the character would have no connection to the recently released [[Earth-120703|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film series]]. The announcement also indicated that Spider-Man would be introduced in an MCU film (later revealed to be ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'') prior to appearing in his standalone feature.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/24062/sony_pictures_entertainment_brings_marvel_studios_into_the_amazing_world_of_spider-man|title=Sony Pictures Entertainment Brings Marvel Studios Into The Amazing World Of Spider-Man|work=Marvel.com|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=13 April 2016}}\n* The film was originally scheduled for a July 28, 2017 release, but was moved forward to July 7, 2017.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jumanji-release-date-pushed-spider-857644|title=Jumanji' Release Date Pushed, 'Spider-Man' Shifts|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=21 June 2016}} \n* The title of the film was revealed at CinemaCon 2016.<ref name=\"Annoucement\"/>\n* With a worldwide total box office gross of about $880 million, this film became the 6th-highest-grossing film of 2017.{{cite|ref=true|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2017&p=.htm|title= 2017 Yearly Box Office Results|work= Box Office Mojo|accessdate= 25 February 2018}}\n* A title card mistakenly states that the events of this movie happen 8 years after ''[[Marvel's The Avengers]]'', which had come out only 5 years prior. Furthermore, given there are mentions to ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' happening six months prior, ''Homecoming'' is chronologically in 2016, only four years after ''The Avengers''.\n* Two sequels followed, ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019 and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' in 2021.\n| Trivia                  = * The fanfare that plays over the Marvel Studios logo showcase at the beginning is an updated version of the iconic ''Spider-Man'' theme song from the [[Spider-Man (1967 animated series)|1967 animated series]].\n* The film's production title was \"''The Summer of George''\", a reference to a ''{{WP|Seinfeld}}'' episode of the same name.{{cite|ref=true|refname=EW|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/08/02/spider-man-homecoming-writers-answer-burning-questions/|title=Spider-Man: Homecoming writers answer burning questions|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2 August 2017}}\n* Various appearances of the [[Midtown High School|Midtown School of Science & Technology]] crest throughout the film reveal that the school was founded in 1962.

The reference is further made explicitly clear when Karen, the A.I. of Peter's suit, advises Peter to kiss her.\n* An scrapped idea to delve into [[Michelle Jones (Earth-199999)|Michelle]]'s backstory was going to show her having nobody to come pick her up after returning from the trip to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with Peter and May offering to give her a ride home.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/why-spider-man-far-home-nixed-a-donald-glover-cameo-1223627|title='Spider-Man: Far From Home' Team Considered a Donald Glover Cameo|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Aaron|last=Couch|date=13 July 2019|accessdate=19 July 2019}}\n* The sequence of Spider-Man being trapped under rubble and struggling to get free is an explicit homage to {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 33}}.\n* Besides indicating that Peter had found the hero within himself, the image of Peter seeing a reflection of his face that was half-masked by his Spider-Man persona is a recurring image that appears in Spider-Man comics.\n* The shirt that Peter wears when visiting [[New Avengers Facility]] is the same shirt Pepper Potts wears when she was attacked by the [[Iron Man Armor MK XLII (Earth-199999)|MK XLII]] while Tony was sleeping in ''[[Iron Man 3 (film)|Iron Man 3]]''.\n* {{WP|Jona Xiao}} was cast in an undisclosed role, but did not appear in the final cut of the film.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://variety.com/2016/film/news/jona-xiao-spider-man-homecoming-1201842327/|title=Jona Xiao Joins ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’|last=McNary|first=Dave|work=Variety|date=22 August 2016|22 August 2016}}\n* Writers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein's original pitch of the movie differed in the following ways with the final version of the script:\n** The movie opened with Peter's cellphone footage rather than the Vulture's origin story. This prelude was added to place more emphasis on Toomes.\n** Peter filmed his heroic feats using a GoPro camera, anonymously posting them on YouTube, and racking up the money from video views. This element was intended to be a modernization of Spider-Man's classic concept of selling his own pictures to the Daily Bugle.\n** Aunt May reacted when she walked into Peter's room while he was in his underwear next to Ned, expressing something akin to \"No judgment.\" This line was removed to stay away from any allusions.\n** When inquiring about Peter's powers, Ned asked if he produced his webbing organically, as a reference to Sam Raimi's original [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']] trilogy, in which Spider-Man's web did sprout from Peter's hands.\n** Before it was decided to connect the Vulture with Peter's school life through Liz, Toomes was going to be a teacher at the school, where he secretly crafted his wings.\n** Liz's party was originally going to be held at Peter's apartment. While in his bedroom changing into Spider-Man to surprise Liz, Peter left after noticing something criminal going on outside. Peter's classmates burst into his bedroom while he was gone and started going through all of his stuff, finding different toys and action figures he still plays with.\n** When Spider-Man stole Flash Thompsons' car, he also demanded Flash to give him his pants just for the sake of petty revenge, throwing them a mile away before driving off.\n** Peter was going to consider revealing his secret identity at the press conference when he was going to be introduced as an Avenger, but backed off after realizing that there is a virtue in having a secret identity, an advantage over his fellow superheroes.\n** When Happy Hogan talked with Peter Parker in the boys' restroom, he said, \"Oh yeah, Tony wanted me to tell you, 'With great power comes... something, I forgot.'\" Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein stated this line was scrapped due to being \"a little too meta.\"{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/pitch-page-screen-9-ways-spider-man-homecoming-changed-along-way-201352558.html|title=From Pitch to Page to Screen: 9 Ways 'Spider-Man Homecoming' Changed Along the Way|work=Yahoo|first=Kevin|last=Polowy|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=20 July 2017}}\n* In an early version of the script, [[Uncle Ben]] was going to be referenced directly by Aunt May. When Peter is getting ready for homecoming, the wardrobe May gives him would have been explicitly stated to be Ben's clothes. Even though screenwriter John Francis Daley thought it was a nice moment, it was removed, arguing that \"If you're going to talk about someone's death, you don't want it to be a throwaway.\"{{cite|ref=true|refname=EW|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/08/02/spider-man-homecoming-writers-answer-burning-questions/|title=Spider-Man: Homecoming writers answer burning questions|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2 August 2017}}\n* The ''Spider-Man: One More Day'' trade paperback released in 2008 (collecting the [[One More Day|story of the same name]]) includes a statement by Kevin Feige in which he promises to one day put on a Spider-Man movie his favorite moment from the character's history, the scene from {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 35}} in which Aunt May walks into Peter's room to discover that he's Spider-Man.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-homecoming-kevin-feige-promise/|title=Spider-Man: Homecoming Delivered on a Decade-Old Promise by Kevin Feige|work=CBR.com|first=Renaldo|last=Matadeen|date=26 December 2017|accessdate=7 February 2018}}\n\n\n==Gallery==\n===Alternate Posters===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 004 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 001.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 001 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 002.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 002 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 003.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 003 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 005.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 005 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 006.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 007.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 007 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 008.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 008 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 009.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 009 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming Connecting Character Posters.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 010.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 011.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 012.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 013.jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming poster 014.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Other Images===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming (Logo).jpg\nSpider-Man Homecoming 001.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Videos===\n====Trailers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFIRST OFFICIAL Trailer for Spider-Man Homecoming\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - Official Trailer 2 (HD)\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - Official Trailer 3 (HD)\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - Official International Trailer\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - International Trailer 2\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - International Trailer 3 (HD)\n</gallery>\n====Teasers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming Trailer Teaser\nSpider-Man Homecoming Sneak Peek (2017) Movieclips Trailers\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING - NBA Finals Spot 1 - \"The Invite\"\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING – NBA Finals Spot 2 - “Peter Arrives”\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING – NBA Finals Spot 3 - “The Bodega”\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING – NBA Finals Spot 4 - “The Party”\nSPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING – NBA Finals “Watch the Game” Extended Cut\n</gallery>\n====Featurettes====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSpider-Man Homecoming Red Carpet Premiere - Part 1\nSpider-Man Homecoming Red Carpet Premiere - Part 2\n</gallery>\n| Links                   = *[[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* {{Marvel Cinematic Universe|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}\n}}\n[[ru:Человек-паук: Возвращение домой]]\n[[Category:Marvel Studios]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Entertainment]]"
