Plot                    = Five months after Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross is elected President of the United States, he tasks Sam Wilson, the new Captain America, and Joaquin Torres, the new Falcon, with stopping an illegal sale of stolen classified technology in Oaxaca, Mexico. The items, taken from a Japanese mining operation, were smuggled by the Serpent Society, a rogue special-ops unit led by Sidewinder. While Wilson and Torres successfully recover the items, Sidewinder manages to escape.\nDespite Torres’s enthusiasm for his new role, Wilson remains wary, believing that neither of them—unlike Steve Rogers—have the superhuman abilities needed for such high-stakes missions. Seeking guidance, they train with Isaiah Bradley, the forgotten super soldier who was once imprisoned and experimented on by the U.S. government.\n\nMeanwhile, Ross invites Wilson and Torres to a world summit at the White House, where he plans to discuss a new global security issue. Wilson agrees to attend on the condition that Bradley is included as a guest. During the summit, Ross reveals that a newly discovered metal adamantium has been found on \"Celestial Island,\" a landmass that emerged in the Indian Ocean following the frozen remains of the Celestial Tiamut. The stolen items were actually the first refined samples of adamantium. Ross urges the international leaders to sign a treaty governing its mining and distribution, warning of an impending arms race.\nAs Ross speaks, the song Mr. Blue begins playing over the sound system. Suddenly, several attendees—including Bradley—fall under its influence and attempt to assassinate Ross and other dignitaries. Ross’s chief of security, former Black Widow Ruth Bat-Seraph, subdues the attackers, who regain their senses and profess no memory of the incident.\n\nSuspicious of the attack’s origins, Wilson investigates and is ambushed by Sidewinder but manages to capture him. Meanwhile, Torres traces a call from Sidewinder’s phone to a classified U.S. black site known as Camp Echo One in West Virginia. As tensions rise, Japan blames Ross for the adamantium theft and the White House attack, straining diplomatic relations.\nRoss soon realises the true mastermind: Dr. Samuel Sterns, the former scientist who was exposed to Bruce Banner’s gamma-irradiated blood years prior, granting him vastly enhanced intelligence. Ross had secretly imprisoned Sterns at Camp Echo One, publicly blaming him for the Abomination’s past rampage. To secure Sterns's expertise, Ross had promised him eventual freedom—only to renege on the deal after reaching the presidency. Enraged and seeking revenge, Sterns orchestrated the attack using mind-control technology and Mr. Blue as a trigger.\n\nWilson and Torres infiltrate Camp Echo One, uncovering Sterns’s experiments on prisoners and soldiers. During a battle against mind-controlled troops, Sterns escapes. Bat-Seraph arrives to aid Wilson and Torres, leading them to their ally Dennis Dunphy, a military contact holding Sidewinder in custody. Through interrogation, Wilson deduces Sterns’s true endgame—destroying Ross’s credibility on the global stage.\n\nWith tensions escalating, Wilson, Torres, and Bat-Seraph race to Celestial Island, where Ross and Japan’s Prime Minister are locked in a standoff over adamantium rights. As negotiations teeter on collapse, Sterns executes his final move: using his mind-control technology on two American pilots, forcing them to attack the Japanese fleet. Wilson and Torres intercept the aircraft, preventing a war but at great cost—Torres is critically injured.\n\nAs the crisis unfolds, Ross confesses a shocking truth: he is dying of heart failure. In desperation, he had coerced Sterns into developing experimental pills to prolong his life. However, fearing Sterns’s unchecked power, Ross refused to free him, inadvertently fueling Sterns’s vendetta.\n\nSterns retaliates by having Dunphy murdered before he can warn Wilson of another dire secret—the pills were laced with gamma radiation, slowly transforming Ross into something far more dangerous. After a brief moment of reflection with his old friend Bucky Barnes, Wilson prepares for the inevitable showdown.\n\nDuring a press conference meant to restore public confidence, Ross succumbs to his growing rage. His body mutates, and he transforms into the monstrous Red Hulk, going on a destructive rampage through the White House. Wilson arrives to stop him, but despite his best efforts, he is unable to overpower Ross. Instead, he appeals to Ross’s humanity, recalling memories of his estranged daughter, Betty, and their visits to Washington, D.C.'s cherry blossoms. The emotional struggle exhausts both men, and Ross finally reverts to human form.\n\nIn the aftermath, Isaiah Bradley is publicly exonerated, Torres recovers from his injuries and accepts Wilson’s offer to join the Avengers, and the adamantium treaty is successfully ratified. Accepting responsibility for his actions, Ross resigns from the presidency and voluntarily submits himself to incarceration at the Raft. Wilson and Betty visit him, leaving him to ponder the consequences of his ambition.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an imprisoned Sterns ominously warns Wilson: a far greater threat is coming—one from beyond Earth.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Anthony Mackie}} as [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-199999)|Captain America / Sam Wilson]]\n* {{WP|Harrison Ford}} as [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-199999)|Red Hulk
