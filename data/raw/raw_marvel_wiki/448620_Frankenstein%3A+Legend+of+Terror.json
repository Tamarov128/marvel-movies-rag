Believing that the monster is to be dead, Victor rejoins his wife, [[Elizabeth Lavenza (Earth-800801)|Elizabeth]] and his daughter, [[Emily Frankenstein (Earth-800801)|Emily]]. Meanwhile, inspector [[Belbeau (Earth-800801)|Bellbeau]] begins an inquiry into a series of gruesome and unexplained killings. Unbeknownst to Victor, his former assistant, Zuckel, who had lost an eye during the confrontation against the monster, resurfaces and resorts to blackmail.\n\nVictor's paranoia escalates as he increasingly experiences horrifying nightmares about his creature, convinced that he is inherently evil. Despite his fall, the monster manages to survive and in a state of confusion, resorts to stealing clothes and food from the villagers, inadvertently causing their deaths, including that of Zuckel. Meanwhile, Victor's daughter, Emily forms a bond with her wise and blind grandfather, [[Emily Frankenstein's grandfather (Earth-800801)|Mr. Frankenstein]], who had previously warned Victor against his experiments. Unexpectedly, the monster stumbles upon Mr. Frankenstein's cabin and discovers kindred spirits in Emily and the old man. Recognizing that the creature simply yearns for love, they give him the name, \"[[Franken Frankenstein (Earth-800801)|Franken]]\" and forge a friendship.\n\nIn Victor's quest to eliminate any trace of his experiments, he resolved to track down Franken and end his existence. Although Emily and Franken becomes acquainted with the concept of god. Tragically, when a devastating fire erupts in the woods, Franken was able to saved her grandfather, Mr. Frankenstein, he also tries to save Emily's mother, Elizabeth, but he was too as she was incinerated by the flames. A tragic turn of events unfolds as [[Phillip (Earth-800801)|Philip]] mistakenly takes aim at Franken, inadvertently meeting his own demise.\n\nEmily believes that Franken had intentionally caused the situation, leading her to shoot his hand. This leaves Franken isolated once again. In search of solace, he takes shelter in a church. While standing before a crucifix, Franken observes the shared affliction of a hole in both christ's and his own hand. Overwhelmed, with emotions, he weeps and pleads, with god for forgiveness. Victor convinced that, Franken is responsible for his wife, Elizabeth's death, discovers him in the church, but he fails to capture him as he swiftly escapes.\n\nMr. Frankenstein informs Emily that, her mother, Elizabeth's death was not caused by Franken's actions, prompting her to embark on a journey to find him and to apologise Franken forever doubting him, in the mountains, Bellbeau and his police force attack Franken, but Emily steps in to save him and in that moment, he utters her name for the first time, feeling weary of a life he never desired, Franken chooses to end his existence by hurling himself off a cliff.\n\nVictor tormented by the havoc he has wrought, he succumbs to madness and takes his own life with a gunshot to the chest. Bellbeau pays a visit to Franken's grave, while Emily, now under the care of her grandfather, Mr. Frankenstein, embraces a new life. As a symbol of their connection, the red scarf Emily had given Franken dissipates in the wind.\n\n| Cast                    = '''JAPANESE CAST'''\n\n'''Hōsei Komatsu''' as Frankenstein's Monster\n\n'''Nachi Nozawa''' as Dr. Victor Frankenstein\n\n'''Ichirō Nagai''' as Grandfather\n\n'''Jouji Yanami''' as Inspector Belbo\n\n'''Kei Tomiyama''' as Skel\n\n'''Mami Koyama''' as Emily Frankenstein\n\n'''Minori Matsushima''' as Elizabeth Frankenstein\n\n'''Yoku Shioya''' as Phillip\n\n'''Banjou Ginga''' as Detective 1\n\n'''Kaneto Shiozawa''' as Detective 2\n\n'''Kei Tomiyama''' as Sukeru\n\n'''Keiko Yamamoto''' as Housekeeper\n\n'''Makoto Terada''' as Dean\n\n\n'''ENGLISH CAST'''\n\n'''Greg Finley''' as Victor Frankenstein\n\n'''Rebecca Forstadt''' as Emily\n\n'''Dan Woren''' as Detective 1 and Mob 2\n\n'''Joe Perry''' as Farmer Father, Mob 1, Sergeant and Wedding Guest 2\n\n'''Louise Chamis''' as Emma\n\n'''Michael Reynolds''' as Grandpa Frankenstein\n\n'''Richard Epcar''' as Franken\n\n'''Robert V.
