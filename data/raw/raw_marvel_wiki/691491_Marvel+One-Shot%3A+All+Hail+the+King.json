Trevor's bodyguard Herman escorts him to conduct a final interview with documentary filmmaker Jackson Norriss. By showing Trevor pieces of his past, including a promo reel for an 80s crime show that never aired, Jackson tries to uncover more about who this suddenly-famous nobody really is, and how he came to find himself taking on the Mandarin mantle. Over the course of their discussion, Norriss produces a gun hidden in his camera. But instead of killing him he reveals himself as an agent of the once reclusive Ten Rings, and informs Slattery that there is a ''real'' Mandarin. While Slattery struggles to comprehend this turn of events, Noriss initiates a prison breakout for him.\n\nA moment in which Trevor does his Mandarin impression is later seen from the perspective of Justin Hammer, revealed to be also imprisoned in Seagate, and bemoans his predicament over a meal.\n\n| Cast                    = * [[wikipedia:Ben Kingsley|Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery (Earth-199999)|Trevor Slattery]]\n* [[wikipedia:Scoot McNairy|Scoot McNairy]] as [[Jackson Norriss (Earth-199999)|Jackson Norriss]]\n* [[wikipedia:Lester Speight|Lester Speight]] as [[Herman (Inmate) (Earth-199999)|Herman]]\n* [[wikipedia:Sam Rockwell|Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer (Earth-199999)|Justin Hammer]]\n* [[wikipedia:Matt Gerald|Matt Gerald]] as White Power Dave\n* Allen Maldonado as [[Fletcher Heggs (Earth-199999)|Fletcher Heggs]]\n[[wikipedia:Crystal the Monkey|Crystal the Monkey]] appears as a monkey drinking Vodka in Trevor's CBS pilot ''Caged Heat''.\n\n| Notes                   = * This Marvel One-Shot was released alongside the DVD/Blu-Ray for ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.\n| Trivia                  = * [[Seagate Prison]] is the same facility where [[Luke Cage (Earth-199999)|Luke Cage]] was wrongly imprisoned, which would later be shown in a flashback on the Netflix show ''[[Marvel's Luke Cage]]''.{{r|Marvel's Luke Cage Season 1 4}}\n* The name of Trevor Slattery's 80's crime show ''Caged Heat'' was the working title, and distribution alias, for ''[[Iron Man 3 (film)|Iron Man 3]]''.\n* One of the actors credited in the ''Caged Heat'' pilot is named after [[w:c:avp:Rick Hawkins|Rick Hawkins]], the character ''Iron Man 3'' director Shane Black portrayed in the 1987 film ''[[w:c:avp:Predator (film)|Predator]]''.\n* The tracksuit criminals who appeared in the ''Caged Heat'' footage were based off [[Hawkeye Vol 4|Hawkeye]]'s \"[[Tracksuit Mafia (Earth-616)|Tracksuit Mafia]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mrdrewpearce/status/438372697685258241|title=Clearly the #AllHailTheKing tracksuit vampires cameo is a thank-you to @mattfraction for letting us crib so many of his ideas in Iron Man 3.|last=Pearce|first=Drew|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n==Videos==\n<gallery hideaddbutton=\"true\" position=\"center\">\nMarvel One-Shot All Hail the King - Clip 1\n</gallery>\n| Links                   = *[[Marvel Films#Marvel One-Shots|Marvel Films]]\n}}\n[[Category:Short Films]]\n[[Category:Marvel One-Shots]]"
