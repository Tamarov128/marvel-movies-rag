in the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]], with Russell Crowe portraying [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-199999)|Zeus]].\n* During the film's production, there was originally planned to be a scene depicting the [[Symbiotes]]' [[Klyntar (Location)|homeworld]] with dead symbiotes. It's possible that it would've shown [[Knull (Earth-688B)|Knull]] freeing himself and taking control of the symbiotes, but this scene was ultimately scrapped.<ref>https://comicbookmovie.com/spider_man/kraven-the-hunter/kraven-the-hunter-concept-art-reveals-scrapped-plans-to-visit-a-planet-of-dead-symbiotes-a215577</ref>\n\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Upcoming Films|Marvel Films]]\n| IMDB ID                 = 8790086\n| Marvel Movies           = {{PAGENAME}}\n| Spider-Man Films        = {{PAGENAME}}\n}}\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Entertainment]]\n[[es:Kraven el Cazador (película)]]\n[[ru:Крэйвен Охотник (фильм)]]\n[[tr:Avcı Kraven (film)]]"
