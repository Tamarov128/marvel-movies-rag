chronologially}}\n\n| Plot                    = Having acquired the Power Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept a spaceship carrying the surviving Asgardians. As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.\n\nHulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe; in response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Maw captures Strange, but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Facility. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, who surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, where they and Eitri create Stormbreaker, a battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adopted daughter, who reveals the location of the Soul Stone to save her captive adopted sister Nebula from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora, earning the stone.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the group's hold and overpower them. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and despite Maximoff's attempt to destroy the Mind Stone, removes it from Vision's head, killing him.\n\nThor severely wounds Thanos, but Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away. Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker, as well as Maria Hill and Nick Fury, although Fury is able to transmit a signal to Carol Danvers first. Stark and Nebula remain on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on another planet.\n\n| Cast                    = \n\n* {{WP|Robert Downey, Jr.}} as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Iron Man / Tony Stark]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/20786/robert_downey_jr_to_return_as_marvels_iron_man|title=Robert Downey Jr. To Return As Marvel's Iron Man|work=Marvel.com|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015}}\n\n* {{WP|Chris Hemsworth}} as [[Thor Odinson (Earth-199999)|Thor]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://collider.com/avengers-3-4-chris-hemsworth-reveals-marvel-movies-left-on-his-contract/|title=Chris Hemsworth Reveals the 3 Marvel Movies Left on His Contract|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|work=Collider|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=15 April 2015}}\n\n* {{WP|Mark Ruffalo}} as [[Bruce Banner (Earth-199999)|The Hulk / Bruce Banner]]<ref name=\"Announcement\"/>{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-phase-3-kevin-feige/|title=Watch: All Of Your Marvel Phase 3 Questions Answered By Marvel Head Kevin Feige|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|work=/Film|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=8 April 2015}}\n\n* {{WP|Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans}} as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain America / Steve Rogers]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/interviews/a34618/chris-evans-avengers-age-of-ultron-interview-captain-america/|title=True or False: Chris Evans Is Just Like His Age of Ultron Hero Captain America|last=Patches|first=Matt|work=Esquire|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=27 April 2015}}\n\n* {{WP|Scarlett Johansson}} as [[Natalia Romanoff (Earth-199999)|Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff]]{{cite|ref=true|url= http://www.ibtimes.com/scarlett-johansson-teases-how-black-widow-will-react-guardians-galaxy-2518402|title= Scarlett Johansson Teases How Black Widow Will React To The Guardians Of The Galaxy|accessdate= 2017-05-01|last= Massabrook|first= Nicole|date= 2017-03-30|work= International Business Times}}\n\n* {{WP|Don Cheadle}} as [[James Rhodes (Earth-199999)|War Machine / Col.

They couldn't do it because of the intervention of the film's affiliated legal department.{{cite|ref=true|refname=Huffpost|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/saddest-death-avengers-infinity-war_us_5af9dc8de4b0200bcab7d3e0|title=What You Missed About The Saddest Death In 'Avengers: Infinity War'|work=Huffington Post|first=Bill|last=Bradley|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=26 May 2018}}\n* A scrapped idea for the rescue of Doctor Strange from Ebony Maw had Tony send his [[Iron Man Armor MK L (Earth-199999)|Iron Man Armor MK L]] onto Strange to protect him, with the armor forming itself around the [[Eye of Agamotto (Knowledge)|Eye of Agamotto]] and using it as its power source. In turn, Tony would have donned the [[Cloak of Levitation]]. The idea behind this concept was to switch the heroes' power sets to explore new interactions between the characters.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.cbr.com/iron-strange-armor-avengers-infinity-war/|title=Iron Strange: Infinity War Nearly Introduced the Best Iron Man Armor of All|work=CBR.com|first=L.D.|last=Nolan|date=21 November 2019|accessdate=21 November 2019}}\n** According to filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]], this scene was actually filmed, with writers Markus and McFeely having showed him set photos of {{WP|Benedict Cumberbatch}} in the Iron Man Armor and {{WP|Robert Downey, Jr.}} wearing the Cloak of Levitation.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2020/03/13/kevin-smith-reveals-doctor-strange-in-iron-mans-armor-avengers-infinity-war-scene-filmed/|title=Kevin Smith Reveals Doctor Strange In Iron Man's Armor Avengers: Infinity War Scene Was Actually Filmed|work=ComicBook.com|first=Spencer|last=Perry|date=13 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}\n* [[James Rhodes (Earth-199999)|War Machine]] was originally going to wear two suits in this movie.

After this encounter, the two characters would have come out merged. The fusion would have taken place during Banner's confrontation against Cull Obsidian, with the merged Hulk busting out of the [[Iron Man Armor MK XLVIII (Earth-199999)|Hulkbuster 2.0]]. This plot resolution was scrapped late into development, which caused scenes from the first act of {{sl|Avengers: Endgame}} to be reshot since they made use of Smart Hulk.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines|title=How the Avengers: Endgame Writers Made Life-and-Death Decisions|work=Vanity Fair|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=25 December 2019}}\n* An earlier draft of the movie saw Doctor Strange pushing Thanos through time and space in a surreal sequence to have him judged by the [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Living Tribunal]].
