Ravager's mining craft\n* Ravager armada\n\n| Plot                    = The Guardians of the Galaxy work to protect the batteries of the Sovereign from invaders. Rocket steals some of the batteries and the Sovereign armada attempts to get them back. The Guardians struggle as they fly through an asteroid field, but another armada meets them on the other side. A mysterious ship appears and destroys this new armada. The mysterious ship locates the Guardians and the ship's pilot reveals himself as Ego, the father of Peter Quill. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot stay behind to repair their ship and guard Gamora.\n\nAyesha, the leader of the Sovereign, hires Yondu Udonta and his crew to recapture the Guardians. Yondu's lieutenant Taserface takes over the ship and imprisons Rocket and Yondu. Baby Groot helps them escape.\n\nEgo explains his background as a Celestial to Quill and they start bonding as father and son. Quill starts learning how to control his powers as a half-Celestial. Meanwhile, Drax meets Ego's empath, Mantis, who eventually warns him that Ego has been killing off his other progeny. Ego explains to Quill that he, unlike his other progeny, has inherited Celestial powers. Ego tells Quill about his \"purpose\" in living as an immortal being, to terraform other planets into extensions of himself. Ego tries to enlist Quill to this purpose, but Quill resists when he learns that Ego killed his mother.\n\nWhile Quill battles his father, the Guardians work to plant a bomb at the core of the planet Ego. The bomb kills Ego and the planet disintegrates. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Chris Pratt}} as [[Peter Quill (Earth-199999)|Star-Lord / Peter Quill]]\n** {{WP|Wyatt Oleff}} as young Peter Quill\n\n* {{WP|Zoe Saldana}} as [[Gamora (Earth-199999)|Gamora]]\n\n* {{WP|Dave Bautista}} as [[Drax (Earth-199999)|Drax the Destroyer]]\n\n* {{WP|Vin Diesel}} and [[James Gunn]] as [[Groot II (Earth-199999)|Groot]]\n\n* {{WP|Bradley Cooper}} and {{WP|Sean Gunn}} as [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-199999)|Rocket / 89P13]]\n\n* {{WP|Michael Rooker}} as [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-199999)|Yondu Udonta]]\n\n* {{WP|Karen Gillan}} as [[Nebula (Earth-199999)|Nebula]]\n\n* {{WP|Pom Klementieff}} as [[Mantis (Earth-199999)|Mantis]]\n\n* {{WP|Kurt Russell}} as [[Ego (Earth-199999)|Ego]]\n\n* {{WP|Elizabeth Debicki}} as [[Ayesha (Earth-199999)|Ayesha]]\n\n* {{WP|Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan}} as [[Taserface (Earth-199999)|Taserface]]\n\n* {{WP|Sean Gunn}} as [[Kraglin Obfonteri (Earth-199999)|Kraglin Obfonteri]]\n\n* {{WP|Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan}} as [[Tullk (Earth-199999)|Tullk]]\n\n* {{WP|Laura Haddock}} as [[Meredith Quill (Earth-199999)|Meredith Quill]]\n\n* {{WP|Sylvester Stallone}} as [[Stakar Ogord (Earth-199999)|Stakar Ogord]]\n\nAdditionally, {{WP|Gregg Henry}} and {{WP|Seth Green}} reprise their roles from the first film as [[Jason Quill (Earth-199999)|Peter Quill's grandfather]] and [[Howard Duckson (Earth-199999)|Howard the Duck]], respectively. {{WP|Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones}}, {{WP|Jimmy Urine}}, {{WP|Stephen Blackehart}}, {{WP|Steve Agee}}, Joe Fria, Terence Rosemore, and Mike Escamilla portray the Ravagers [[Retch (Earth-199999)|Retch]], [[Halfnut (Earth-199999)|Halfnut]], [[Brahl (Earth-199999)|Brahl]], [[Gef (Earth-199999)|Gef]], [[Oblo (Earth-199999)|Oblo]], [[Narblik (Earth-199999)|Narblik]], and [[Scrote (Earth-199999)|Scrote]], respectively.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/02/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-adds-steve-agee.html|title=Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 adds Steve Agee|last=Cook|first=Justin|work=Flickering Myth|date=2 February 2016|accessdate=13 February 2016}}{{cite|ref=true|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/4012847|title=The Ravagers Could Be A Bigger Threat In 'Guardians Of The Galaxy 2': Meet The Team To Find Out Why|last=Derisz|first=Ricky|work=Movie Pilot|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=27 July 2016}} {{WP|Michael Rosenbaum}}, {{WP|Ving Rhames}}, {{WP|Michelle Yeoh}}, and {{WP|Miley Cyrus}} portray [[Martinex T'Naga (Earth-199999)|Martinex]], [[Charlie-27 (Earth-199999)|Charlie-27]], [[Aleta Ogord (Earth-199999)|Aleta Ogord]], and [[Mainframe (Earth-199999)|Mainframe]], respectively, all of whom are members of Stakar and Yondu's old Ravager team (an adaptation of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)|1969 incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy]]).{{cite|ref=true|url=http://screencrush.com/gunn-guardians-2-stallone-rosenbaum/|title=‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ Director James Gunn Teases Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rosenbaum’s Big Mystery Roles|last=Hayes|first=Britt|work=ScreenCrush|date=17 March 2017|accessdate=17 March 2017}} Frequent James Gunn collaborator {{WP|Rob Zombie}} has another voiceover role in the film.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/834596820043042817|title=It isn’t a James Gunn film without @RobZombie’s voice!!|last=Gunn|first=James|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=23 February 2017}} {{WP|Stan Lee}} makes a cameo in the film.
