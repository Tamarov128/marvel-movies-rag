Miguel tests it in the population of Belleville and then blackmails the American government by spreading it in Portland.\n\nHowever, an ally of Ilson, Dr. Mills, recruits Captain America to track Miguel. Captain America convinces one inhabitant of Belleville, Helen Moore, to help him, and finally finds Miguel's lair in a federal penitentiary. Captain America fights Miguel's minions, and finally Miguel is accidentally infected with the chemical. The villain dies of old age in a few seconds, and Captain America grabs enough antidote to heal the Portlanders.\n\n| Cast                    = * Reb Brown as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-600043)|Captain America (Steven Rogers)]]\n* Connie Selleca as [[Wendy Day (Earth-600043)|Dr. Wendy Day]]\n* Len Birman as [[Simon Mills (Earth-600043)|Dr. Simon Mills]]\n* Christopher Lee as [[Miguel (Earth-600043)|General Miguel]]\n* Katherine Justice as [[Helen Moore (Earth-600043)|Helen Moore]]\n* Christopher Cary as [[Ian Ilson (Earth-600043)|Professor Ian Ilson]]\n* Ken Swofford as [[Everett Bliss (Earth-600043)|Everett Bliss]]<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078938/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Captain America II: Death Too Soon's cast at IMDb]</ref>\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Television Films|Marvel Films]]\n}}\n[[Category:Universal Pictures]]"
