According to Ryan Reynolds himself, \"by page 1.5, it was totally untenable\" and the idea was dropped.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/07/deadpool-2-original-script/|title=Deadpool 2 original script had Deadpool as a dad|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Tim|last=Stack|date=7 May 2018|accessdate=8 May 2018}}\n* Some drafts of this film had Wade and Vanessa breaking up, rather than her dying.{{cite|ref=true|refname=CBR interview|url=https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-2-spoilers-screenwriters-rhett-reese-paul-wernick-interview/|title=Deadpool 2 Writers Break Down the (Many) Big Surprises in the Film|work=CBR.com|first=Albert|last=Ching|date=18 May 2018|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* Deadpool was almost going to sport an updated costume with additional paneling on the arms, back, and legs.

He lived until the end of the third act, and he became the devil on Firefist's shoulder, trying to get him to turn bad. His role was cut due to budget constraints.<ref name=\"CBR interview\"/>\n* Brad Pitt's cameo as the Vanisher was worked on very late into the film's production. According to co-writer Rhett Reese, he agreed to do it \"for scale and a cup of Starbucks — but Ryan's got to go get the Starbucks for me.\"<ref name=\"CBR interview\"/>\n* The film's mid-credit scenes were shot as part of additional photography, and were not featured in test screenings.<ref name=\"CBR interview\"/>\n* The film's mid-credit scenes of Deadpool travelling through time originally ended with Wade killing an infant Adolf Hitler.
