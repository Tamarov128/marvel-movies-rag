Elektra is revived by her Kimagure master, [[Stick (Earth-701306)|Stick]], who trains her then with his group of ninjas, The Chaste. The Kimagure training is the one which allows ''controlling past, present, and future'', and ''reviving the death'' even. However, Elektra is expelled off the group, before finishing her training. And so the story of this movie begins when Elektra is a mythical assassin, slaying DeMarco with one of her Sai daggers, in his own manor.\n\nElektra is engaged then in a new job to slay a still undisclosed subject. She moves to the area, an insular one, abiding in a big residence. Then, she sympathizes with a 13 year old girl, Abby, by whom Elektra becomes a friend of her father, Mark Miller. However, Elektra's orders arrive and the victims result precisely to be both Miller and his child. Then, the confused Elektra refuses to go on, ready to abandon the area. About boarding the ferry, she perceives some killers around, through her Kimagure intuition. Effectively when she gets to Miller's house, two assassins have gotten there. Elektra stops them, discovering their ''[[Hand (Earth-701306)|Order of The Hand]]'' affiliation, and then she escapes with Abby and her father.\n\nOn the way, Elektra gets to a pool club to meet her master, Stick, who would help against The Hand. She learns that the actual victim is not Mark but Abby, indeed. The child is coveted by the evil members of The Hand, to become one amongst them, because she is the mythical ''Treasure'', a warrior who could tip the balance of good and evil.\n\nThe leader of The Hand dispatches his own son, [[Kirigi (Earth-701306)|Kirigi]], to deal with the intervention of Elektra. Kirigi convenes some powerful henchmen: [[Tudo Sokuto (Earth-701306)|Tattoo]] (who endows life, to the animal figures which are designed over his skin), [[Mary Walker (Earth-701306)|Typhoid]] (who spreads death over all living creatures on her way), [[Stone (Earth-701306)|Stone]] (who is of a super strength), Kinkou (who moves with a great speed).\n\nAfter an eagle of Tattoo spotted Elektra at the pool club, Kirigi finds Elektra, Abby, and Miller, at the farmhouse of McCabe, the man who manages Elektra's assignments usually. McCabe is slain but Elektra and the group reach a nearby forest through an underground passage. Elektra defeats Stone, crushing him timely with a falling tree. With her father, Abby manages to defeat Kinkou. Then, the little girl surprises Elektra showing martial arts skills, and using her large bracelet (''Indonesian warrior beads'') for an effective weapon vanquishing two wolves of Tattoo. However, Typhoid succeeds affecting Elektra who gets paralyzed by a poisonous kiss of her. Timely, the Kimagure army of Stick arrives and The Hand is routed.\n\nAt Stick's camp, Elektra is totally healed and she learns that he would have commanded Elektra to murder Abby. Yet, all was a test which has just been passed. Meanwhile, Abby expresses her sickness being so reclusive amongst the Kimagure, for getting a normal life. Elektra agrees a final duel then with Kirigi. The winner gets Abby.\n\nThe duel takes place at Elektra's childhood house. After dispatching a group of ninjas, Elektra faces Kirigi in a room full of flying white clothes. There, she realizes finally that Kirigi had been the killer of her mother. However, Elektra is overwhelmed by his attacks and as she is about to be slain, Abby surprisingly enters into the battle saving her life.\n\nOutside the house, in the green maze yard, also Tattoo and Typhoid confront Elektra. Tattoo unleashes a multitude of serpents which surrounds Abby despite her desperate usage of her special bracelet. Elektra stops him though, breaking his neck. Also, Elektra defeats Kirigi, who is stabbed by her Sai dagger, falling down into a well, to turn into dust at the bottom.\n\nTyphoid, the jealous former ''Treasure'' of The Hand, reaches Abby and poisons her. Elektra senses this. She throws one of her Sai daggers through the walls of the maze at her foe, killing her. Quickly, Elektra brings Abby's body into the house and she revives her. This proves that, effectively, Elektra has already become a master of the Kimagure order of Stick.\n\n| Cast                    = \n<table class=\"wikitable\" border=1>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">\n<th> Actor </th><th> Role</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Jennifer Garner </td><td> [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-701306)|Elektra Natchios]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Terence Stamp  </td><td> [[Stick (Earth-701306)|Stick]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Will Yun Lee    </td><td> [[Kirigi (Earth-701306)|Kirigi]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Goran Višnjić    </td><td> Mark Miller</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa </td><td> Roshi</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Colin Cunningham   </td><td> McCabe</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Jason Isaacs  </td><td> DeMarco (Uncredited)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Hiro Kanagawa   </td><td> Kinkou</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Natassia Malthe   </td><td> [[Mary Walker (Earth-701306)|Typhoid Mary]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Jana Mitsoula  </td><td> Young Elektra's Mother</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Kirsten Prout </td><td> [[Abigail Miller (Earth-701306)|Abby Miller]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Bob Sapp   </td><td> [[Stone (Earth-701306)|Stone]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Chris Ackerman </td><td> [[Tudo Sokuto (Earth-701306)|Tattoo]]</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td> Edison T.

It is a spin-off to the 2003 movie ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', starring [[Elektra|Elektra Natchios]] (played by Garner). Elektra's weapon of choice is the Sai.\n* For the screenplay, Zak Penn, Stuart Zicherman, and Raven Metzner received \"written by\" credit. Mark Steven Johnson received credit for \"motion picture characters\" and [[Frank Miller]] for \"comic book characters\".\n* Although some other versions of [[Stick]] have traditionally trained Daredevil,<ref>[[Stick (Earth-616)]]</ref><ref>[[Stick (Earth-199999)]]</ref><ref>[[Stick (Earth-92131)]]</ref><ref>[[Stick (Earth-1610)]]</ref> this film version of Stick is shown to have only trained Elektra, and was never shown part of Daredevil's training in the [[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]] movie.\n\n'''Taglines:''' \n* ''Born to fight. Trained to kill.''\n* ''Before she can find peace she will wage war.''\n* ''She's all that stands between good and evil.''\n\n===Critical reaction and box office===\nMuch like the Daredevil film that preceded it, Elektra did not garner the warmest reaction from critics and fans, and it was regarded as a box office failure. It did, however, sell well on DVD. A slightly more polished 2-disc edition director's cut DVD was released in October 2005. On Rotten Tomatoes, ten percent of the critics gave the film a positive review with an average rating of 3.7/10.<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elektra Elektra On Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>\n\nOne of Elektra's main problems is that many devoted comic book fans felt that Jennifer Garner's portrayal of the \"sexy Greek assassin\" was somewhat lackluster and did not capture the spirit of the comic book character. Garner was criticised for being too \"girl-next-door\", as she is generally seen as the classic \"wholesome American girl\", whereas Elektra Natchios is an exotic, feral, sexual and often bloodthirsty character. A British critic said that \"Whereas the comic book character was '[[wikipedia:Angelina Jolie|Angelina Jolie]]', the film character is very much '[[wikipedia:Jennifer Aniston|Jennifer Aniston]]'!\"\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsYp0oWAgk Elektra Trailer on Youtube]\n}}\n[[Category:20th Century Fox]]"
