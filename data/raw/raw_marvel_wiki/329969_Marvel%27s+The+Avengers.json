In exchange for stealing the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], (an energy source of limitless power) for his mysterious master, the Other promises Loki a Chitauri army with which he can subjugate the Earth. The Other then gave Loki a powerful Scepter.\n\n[[Nicholas Fury (Earth-199999)|Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and his lieutenant [[Maria Hill (Earth-199999)|Agent Hill]] arrive by helicopter at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist [[Erik Selvig (Earth-199999)|Doctor Erik Selvig]] is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy, as well as low levels of gamma radiation. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a portal, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki seizes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and several agents, including Clint Barton by mind control, and escapes as the facility implodes.\n\n[[File:Natalia Romanoff (Earth-199999) from Marvel's The Avengers 013.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Romanoff tied to a chair]]\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". S.H.I.E.L.D. moves to their new base of operations, the Helicarrier, where Coulson contacts Agent Natasha Romanoff, who at the moment was in the middle of an interrogation where she was tied to a chair. But Coulson tells her that \"Agent Barton has been compromised\", Romanoff breaks loose of her bondage and manages to defeat her captors, Romanoff is then sent to India to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner; Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research; and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. While Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, Loki causes a distraction in Stuttgart, Germany, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives in the midst of a thunderstorm and frees him hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. There Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\n[[File:HummingStarkCap.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Heroes scattered.]]\nThe [[Avengers (Earth-199999)|Avengers]] become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extra-terrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers try to restart the damaged engines, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk leaves on his own. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for Loki; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a portal above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\n{{Quote|All right, listen up! Until we can close that portal up there, what we need is containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you've got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash. Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down. You've got the lightning - light the bastards up! [''turns to Natasha''] You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk, smash!|[[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain America's]] instructions to his comrades.}}\n\n[[File:Avengers (Earth-199999) from Marvel's The Avengers 001.jpg|thumb|left|210px]]\nThe Avengers rally in defense of New York City, but quickly realize they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. With help from Barton, Rogers, Stark, and Thor evacuate civilians, while Banner transforms back into the Hulk and goes after Loki, eventually beating him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the portal, where Selvig, freed of Loki's control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to close the portal. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the portal toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the invaders' mother ship, thereby disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power and he falls back through the portal, but the Hulk saves him from crashing to the ground. Romanoff deactivates the portal to prevent further invasion. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard. Fury notes that the Avengers will return when they are needed.\n\nIn the first of two post-credits scenes, the Other confers with his [[Thanos (Earth-199999)|master]] about the attack on Earth; in the second post-credits scene, the Avengers eat in silence at a [[Shawarma]] restaurant.\n\n| Cast                    = \n* {{WP|Robert Downey Jr.}} as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Iron Man / Tony Stark]]\n* {{WP|Chris Evans}} as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain America / Steve Rogers]]\n* {{WP|Mark Ruffalo}} as [[Bruce Banner (Earth-199999)|Hulk / Dr. Bruce Banner]]\n** {{WP|Lou Ferrigno}} as voice of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-199999)|Hulk]]\n* {{WP|Chris Hemsworth}} as [[Thor Odinson (Earth-199999)|Thor]]\n* {{WP|Scarlett Johansson}} as [[Natalia Romanoff (Earth-199999)|Black Widow / Agent Natasha Romanoff]]\n* {{WP|Jeremy Renner}} as [[Clinton Barton (Earth-199999)|Hawkeye / Agent Clint Barton]]\n* {{WP|Tom Hiddleston}} as [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-199999)|Loki]]\n* {{WP|Clark Gregg}} as [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-199999)|Agent Phil Coulson]]\n* {{WP|Cobie Smulders}} as [[Maria Hill (Earth-199999)|Agent Maria Hill]]\n* {{WP|Jenny Agutter}} as [[Councilwoman Hawley (Earth-199999)|Councilwoman Hawley]]\n* {{WP|Jerzy Skolimowski}} as [[Georgi Luchkov (Earth-199999)|Georgi Luchkov]]\n* {{WP|Stellan Skarsgård}} as [[Erik Selvig (Earth-199999)|Dr. Erik Selvig]]\n* {{WP|Samuel L.

Four of the preceding Marvel Studios productions (''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2 (film)|Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'') were released by Paramount Pictures and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' was released by Universal Studios. The Paramount logo appears on Avengers posters and the film's opening titles as part of the deal between Disney and Paramount. Walt Disney Pictures is not credited until the final moments after the credits.\n| Trivia                  = [[File:The Avengers (film) poster 011 (English version).jpg|thumb|right|125px|UK version of the poster]]\n* Walt Disney Pictures retitled the film in the United Kingdom and Ireland to avoid confusion with {{WP|The Avengers (TV series)|the unrelated 1961 British TV series of the same title}}, which in turn had its own {{WP|The Avengers (1998 film)|similarly titled movie adaptation in 1998}}. The film was retitled ''Avengers Assemble'', after the popular catchphrase from the comic books. The reaction to the title change was mixed.\n* The post-credits scene was filmed on the 12th of April<ref>[http://collider.com/the-avengers-filming-new-scene/158987/ Collider]</ref> (after ''Marvel's The Avengers'' world premiere). It features the six Avengers eating at the shawarma restaurant mentioned by Stark. {{WP|Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans}} had to wear a prosthetic face mask to hide his beard growth and further conceals the mask behind his hand as he eats. Due to the late filming of this scene, it was not ready for the international release on the 25th and therefore does not appear on ''Marvel's The Avengers'' presentations in many countries.\n* The shawarma restaurant scene was inspired by [[Joss Whedon]]'s own work in the TV series ''{{WP|Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel}}'', namely the ending of the {{WP|Angel (season 5)|fifth season}}'s fifteenth episode.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/joss-whedons-favorite-angel-death-led-to-the-avengers-post-credits-scene|title=Joss Whedon's Favorite \"Angel\" Death Led to \"The Avengers\" Post-Credit Scene|work=Comic Book Resources|first=Jesse|last=Gormley|date=18 August 2016|accessdate=18 August 2016}}\n* According to director Joss Whedon, {{WP|Scarlett Johansson}}'s participation in the film was in question early in the film's development. Because of this, Whedon's original script for the film included [[Wasp]] in her place.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/174139-joss-whedon-says-his-avengers-script-originally-included-the-wasp|title=Joss Whedon Says His Avengers Script Originally Included The Wasp|website=SuperHeroHype|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|date=18 December 2012|accessdate=2 January 2013|quote=\"There was a little bit of time where we thought we might not actually get Scarlett [Johansson],\" he explains. \"There was a very Waspy draft that I wrote.
