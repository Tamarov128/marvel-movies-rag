Scott and Hope also begin a romantic relationship and train to fight together as Ant-Man and the Wasp, until Lang decides to help [[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain America]] during the [[Avengers (Earth-199999)|Avengers]] clash by violating the \"[[Sokovia Accords]]\". Lang is sentenced to two years of house arrest, while Pym and Hope, wanted because they are considered his accomplices, are forced to flee and cut ties with Lang.\nTwo years later, Pym and Hope manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm and at the same time Scott receives a mental message from Janet and although there are only a few days left until the end of house arrest, he decides to call Pym. Shortly thereafter Scott is kidnapped by Hope and since the message is confirmation that Janet is alive, father and daughter work to create a stable tunnel so they can cross the quantum realm in a spaceship and retrieve Janet. Hope must purchase a necessary part for the tunnel from black market trader [[Sonny Burch (Earth-199999)|Sonny Burch]], but the latter realizes the potential profit that can be gained from Pym's research and betrays them. Hope fights Burch and his men, until at one point she is attacked by a [[Ava Starr (Earth-199999)|masked woman]], who walks through walls. Lang tries to help fight this \"ghost\", but the latter manages to escape with Pym's portable laboratory.\nThe latter visits his former colleague [[William Foster (Earth-199999)|Bill Foster]], who helps them locate the laboratory. When Scott, Hope and Pym arrive, they discover that the Ghost is Ava Starr. Her father [[Elihas Starr (Earth-199999)|Elihas]], another former colleague of Pym, died along with his wife during his quantum experiment which also caused Ava's molecular instability. Foster reveals to them that he helped Ava her, and that he plans to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill his wife, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manages to escape. Pym and Hope manage to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location on her where to find her, but she also warns them that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the quantum realm separates them for a century. Meanwhile Burch acquires their location from [[Luis (Earth-199999)|Luis]], [[Dave (Earth-199999)|Dave]] and [[Kurt Goreshter (Earth-199999)|Kurt]], Scott's business partners, and informs a contact about him at the FBI. Luis manages to warn Scott, who rushes home before [[James Woo (Earth-199999)|James Woo]] the officer in charge of his surveillance can see him breaking house arrest, but this way Pym and Hope are arrested and their portable laboratory is taken away by Ava.\nScott luckily manages to get Pym and Hope to escape, and find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve his wife, but the two end up fighting Burch and his men, which allows Ava to begin taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave and Kurt help capture Burch, and thanks to this Scott and Hope manage to stop Ava. Pym and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet willingly gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her. Scott returns home once again, just in time for Jimmy Woo to release him, while Ava and Foster flee and disappear.\n\nLater Scott, with the help of the Pym family, enters the quantum realm to gather energy in order to help Ava and heal her completely, but just before he can recover it, Hank, Hope and Janet they dissolve into nothingness as a result of [[Thanos (Earth-199999)|Thanos]]' snap, thus leaving Scott trapped in the quantum realm...\n\n| Cast                    = \n* {{WP|Paul Rudd}} as [[Scott Lang (Earth-199999)|Ant-Man / Scott Lang]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Collider|url=http://collider.com/ant-man-and-the-wasp-michael-douglas/|title='Ant-Man and the Wasp': Michael Douglas Eyeing Return for Sequel|last=Cabin|first=Chris|work=Collider|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=13 November 2015}}\n\n* {{WP|Evangeline Lilly}} as [[Hope Van Dyne (Earth-199999)|The Wasp / Hope Van Dyne]]<ref name=\"Collider\"/>\n** Madeleine McGraw portrays young Hope\n\n* {{WP|Michael Peña}} as [[Luis (Earth-199999)|Luis]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/michael-pena-star-sony-horror-920657|title=Michael Pena to Star in Sony Horror Thriller 'The Bringing' (Exclusive)|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=19 August 2016}}\n\n* {{WP|Walton Goggins}} as [[Sonny Burch (Earth-199999)|Sonny Burch]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/walton-goggins-ant-man-and-the-wasp-cast-1202130667/|title=Walton Goggins Flies To ‘Ant-Man And The Wasp’|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|work=Deadline|date=18 July 2017|accessdate=18 July 2017}}{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/23/comic-con-2017-michelle-pfeiffer-joins-cast-of-ant-man-and-the-wasp|title=Comic-Con 2017: Three Character Castings Revealed for Ant-Man and the Wasp|last=Sanchez|first=Miranda|work=IGN|date=22 July 2017|accessdate=22 July 2017}}\n\n* {{WP|Hannah John-Kamen}} as [[Ava Starr (Earth-199999)|Ghost]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://variety.com/2017/film/news/black-mirrors-hannah-john-kamen-in-ant-man-and-the-wasp-1202456011/|title='Black Mirror's' Hannah John-Kamen Lands Key Role in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Kroll|first=Justin|work=Variety|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}<ref name=\"SDCC 2017\"/>\n** RaeLynn Bratten potrays young Ava\n\n* [[David Dastmalchian]] as [[Kurt Goreshter (Earth-199999)|Kurt]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.etonline.com/media/video/exclusive david dastmalchian confirms kurt is returning for ant man and the wasp-215632/|title=EXCLUSIVE: David Dastmalchian Confirms Kurt Is Returning for 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'|date=19 April 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=Entertainment Tonight}}\n\n* {{WP|T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris}} as [[Dave (Earth-199999)|Dave]]{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.blackfilm.com/read/2017/05/exclusive-ti-confirmed-to-return-marvel-ant-man-and-the-wasp/|title=Exclusive: T.I.
