Meanwhile, his now-teenage daughter, Cassie, has become an outspoken activist, dedicating herself to helping those displaced by the Blip. However, her activism has caused tension between her and Scott, who struggles to reconnect with her.\nWhile visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, Cassie excitedly reveals that she has been working on a device capable of establishing communication with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning this, Janet reacts with panic and forcefully shuts the device off. However, the signal has already been transmitted, triggering a portal that suddenly opens and pulls all five of them into the Quantum Realm.\nOnce inside, Scott and Cassie find themselves separated from the others and are soon discovered by a group of native inhabitants rebelling against their mysterious ruler. Meanwhile, Hope, Janet, and Hank venture into a sprawling, unfamiliar city in search of answers.\nThe trio seeks out Lord Krylar, an old ally of Janet’s, who reveals that the Quantum Realm has changed drastically since her departure. He discloses that he is now working for Kang, the powerful new ruler of the realm. Betrayed, Janet, Hope, and Hank are forced to flee, stealing Krylar’s ship in the process.\nElsewhere, Scott and Cassie are taken in by rebel leader Jentorra, who reveals that Janet’s past involvement with Kang inadvertently led to his rise to power. Before they can act, Kang’s forces, led by the cybernetic warrior M.O.D.O.K., attack the rebels. To Scott’s shock, M.O.D.O.K. is revealed to be Darren Cross, who survived his apparent demise at Scott’s hands.[c] Cross, having intercepted Cassie’s message, takes them both captive.\nAboard Krylar’s stolen ship, Janet finally confesses to Hope and Hank the truth about her past in the Quantum Realm. During her decades trapped there, she encountered Kang, who claimed to be a stranded traveler in need of her help to repair his multiversal power core. Initially, Janet assisted him, believing they could both escape. However, after successfully restoring the core, she was horrified to witness visions of Kang’s atrocities—conquering and annihilating entire timelines. He then revealed that he had been exiled by his own variants, who feared his power. Realising the danger he posed, Janet turned against him, using Pym Particles to enlarge his power core beyond usability. Although Kang ultimately regained his abilities and went on to conquer the Quantum Realm, her sabotage delayed his ambitions.\nNow imprisoned, Scott is brought before Kang, who demands that he retrieve the power core in exchange for Cassie’s life. With no choice, Scott shrinks down into the core’s location, where he encounters a chaotic probability storm that manifests countless versions of himself. Overwhelmed, he nearly succumbs, but Hope arrives just in time to help him stabilize and retrieve the core. However, Kang betrays them, capturing Janet and ordering M.O.D.O.K. to destroy her ship with Hank still aboard.\nMiraculously, Hank survives, having been rescued by his colony of ants, which were also pulled into the Quantum Realm. Due to the unique conditions there, the ants have rapidly evolved into hyper-intelligent beings. With their assistance, Hank, Scott, and Hope regroup and prepare to confront Kang.\nMeanwhile, Cassie breaks free and rescues Jentorra, rallying the rebels for an all-out uprising against Kang’s forces. During the battle, she manages to convince Cross to abandon Kang and fight on their side, leading him to sacrifice himself in the struggle.\nAs the resistance forces gain the upper hand, Janet restores the power core, allowing her, Hank, Hope, and Cassie to escape through a portal back home. However, before Scott can follow, Kang attacks him, determined to force his way into the multiverse. A brutal battle ensues, with Scott nearly overpowered. At the last moment, Hope returns through the portal, and together, she and Scott use Pym Particles to destabilize the core, seemingly destroying Kang in the process. Cassie then reopens the portal, allowing them both to return home.\nScott resumes his normal life, enjoying his newfound peace. However, nagging doubts creep in—he recalls Kang’s ominous warnings that his death would only herald something far worse. Brushing aside his unease, Scott chooses to focus on the present.\nIn a mid-credits scene, numerous Kang variants, led by Immortus, convene to discuss the fallen Kang’s demise, vowing to escalate their multiversal uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki and Mobius M. Mobius track down another Kang variant, Victor Timely, at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, setting the stage for what’s to come.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Paul Rudd}} as [[Scott Lang (Earth-199999)|Ant-Man / Scott Lang]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Reveal Tweet|url=https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1337200211106570243|title=Peyton Reed is back to direct the third Ant-Man film, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
