Evidently, the reality of each character involved in this film is not the same reality of the character's original version.\n* In November 2019, Sony announced a sequel would be released on April 8, 2022, but it was later pushed back six months to October 7, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally, it was pushed to June 2, 2023.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2020/04/24/spider-man-3-and-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2-get-new-release-dates/#2776608537ef|title=I‘Spider-Man 3’ And ‘Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse 2’ Get New Release Dates|last=Bean|first=Travis|work=Forbes|date=24 April 2020|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n* The contact list includes names of past Spider-Man creators like Steve Ditko and Todd McFarlane.\n==Gallery==\n===Posters===\n<gallery>\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse logo 001.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 001.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 002.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 004.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 005.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 006.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 007.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 008.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 009.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 010.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 011.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 012.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 013.png\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 014.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 015.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 016.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 017.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 018.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 019.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 020.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 021.jpg\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse poster 022.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Videos===\n<gallery widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSPIDER-MAN INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE - Official Teaser Trailer\nSPIDER-MAN INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE - Official Trailer (HD)\nSPIDER-MAN INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE - Official Trailer 2 (HD)\n</gallery>\n| Trivia                  = * The introduction scenes of both Peter Parker and Peter B. Parker include several homages to the original [[Earth-96283|''Spider-Man'' film trilogy]]: an upside down kiss with Mary Jane from [[Spider-Man (film)|''Spider-Man'']], stopping a train and saving MJ from a car which was thrown through a window from [[Spider-Man 2 (film)|''Spider-Man 2'']], and the infamous scene of him dancing on the sidewalk from [[Spider-Man 3 (film)|''Spider-Man 3'']]. There is also a reference to ''[[Spider-Man No More!]]'', which was also homaged in ''Spider-Man 2''.\n* The in-universe theme associated with the Peter Parker of Miles' universe is the opening song of the [[Spider-Man (1967 animated series)|''Spider-Man'']] 1967 animated series.\n* The month written on Miles' test sheet at Brooklyn Visions Academy is \"Decembruary\".\n* A recreation of a scene from the TV series ''{{WP|Community (TV series)|Community}}'' with actor {{WP|Donald Glover}} dressed in Spider-Man pajamas appears in the TV of Aaron's apartment. That particular instance of Glover dressed like that was what prompted comic writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to create [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]].\n* In an earlier version of the film, Peter would also have had his own 16-bit fighting video game. [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610B)|Miles]] would have been playing this game with [[Aaron Davis (Earth-1610B)|Aaron Davis]] at his apartment. The idle animation of Peter's in-game character was modeled after that of [[Peter Parker (Earth-30847)|Spider-Man]] as he appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (Series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' and the stage background music was main theme of the 2000 game ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]''. This detail was removed because it muddied the focus of the scene, which was Miles and Aaron talking.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/yuhkidemers/status/1083070491596705792/|title=Yuhki Demers on Twitter: \"In an earlier version of the film Miles and Aaron were playing this fighting game in his apartment. #SpidermanIntoSpiderVerse #16bit…\"|work=Twitter|first=Yuhki|last=Demers|date=9 January 2019|accessdate=6 January 2020}}}}\n* Internally during production, the Peter native to Miles' reality and the foreign Peter were referred to as \"RIPeter\" and \"Burrito Peter,\" respectively.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/nicktyson/status/1081354331562029056|title=Nick Kondo 近藤 on Twitter: \"⭐️Fun Fact (and spoiler alert!)⭐️ The two Peters in #IntoTheSpiderVerse were referred to in the studio as \"RIPeter\" and \"Burrito Peter\" to keep it clear who we were talking about during conversations/animation rounds/etc...\"|work=Twitter|first=Nick|last=Kondo|date=4 January 2019|accessdate=13 January 2020}}}}\n* In addition to his appearance in the costume shop, Stan Lee shows up as a minor background character in numerous moments of the film. He's one of the bystanders that walk over Miles and Peter B. Parker on the street, and he's inside the train Miles runs across in the film's final scene.\n* A poster of {{WP|Chance the Rapper}}'s \"{{WP|Coloring Book (mixtape)|Coloring Book}}\" mixtape appears in Miles' dorm room. In the poster, the number 3 in Chance the Rapper's cap is changed to a 4.\n* The scenes in [[Earth-67]] are taken from the 1967 ''Spider-Man'' animated series' episode \"[[Spider-Man (1967 animated series) Season 1 19B|Double Identity]]\". Using this footage, Spider-Man 2099 and Earth-67 Spider-Man recreate the ''[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man#fn1 Spider-Man Pointing at Spider-Man]'' meme, which originated in this episode.\n* The Spider-Man suit with the cape is based on {{cl|What If? Vol 1 19}}, where [[Peter Parker (Earth-80219)|Spider-Man]] never became a crime fighter.\n* The introductions sequences of Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Peter B. Parker include artwork from actual comic books. Some of the comics seen are {{cl|Spider-Man Vol 1 19}} and {{cl|Spider-Man Vol 1 75}}.\n* The {{Wc|cloudywithachanceofmeatballs|Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator (FLDSMDFR)|FLDSMDFR}} from ''{{Wc|cloudywithachanceofmeatballs|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs}}'' appears in the film's climax as one of the objects being sucked into the Super Collider. ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was directed by ''Into the Spider-Verse'' producers [[Phil Lord]] and [[Christopher Miller]].\n* During the film's final battle, when different versions of Vanessa and Richard Fisk are glitching in and out of reality, one of these pairs is replaced with [[Sister Maggie]] and a young [[Daredevil|Matt Murdock]].\n* The Blu-ray release of the film included an \"Alternate Universe\" version incorporating scenes, characters and even subplots deleted from the final film. One deleted scene has Miles' mother make a direct reference to [[Tony Stark|Iron Man]]. An alternate version of Peter B. Parker's recap flashback sequence features appearances from the [[Bruce Banner|Hulk]], [[Rhino]] and [[Venom (Symbiote)|Ve]][[Eddie Brock|nom]].\n* The Blu-Ray and digital releases also include a short animated film ''[[Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham]]'' starring [[Peter Porker (Earth-8311B)|Spider-Ham (Peter Porker)]] elaborating on the character's activities before being transported to Miles' reality.\n* Live-action [[Peter Parker (Earth-199999)|Peter Parker]] actor {{WP|Tom Holland}} from the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]] was set to make a cameo in the film, but it was scrapped.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://webbedmedia.com/2019/06/26/tom-holland-reveals-his-planned-cameo-for-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/|title=Tom Holland Reveals His Planned Cameo For Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse That Was Scrapped|work=Webbed Media|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=26 June 2019}}}}\n* [[Earth-1610B|Miles' universe]] features alternate versions of various real-world brands, such as {{WP|FedEX|RedEX}}, {{WP|Snapchat|Picaboo}} and {{WP|Google|Backrub}}.\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n}}\n[[es:Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]\n[[pt-br:Homem-Aranha no Aranhaverso]]\n[[ru:Человек-паук: Через вселенные]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Entertainment]]"
