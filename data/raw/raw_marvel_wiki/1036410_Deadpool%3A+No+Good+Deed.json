Deciding to intervene, Wade goes to a nearby phone booth to change into his Deadpool costume, to the tune of {{WP|John Williams}}' ''{{WP|Superman (1978 film)|Superman}}''-theme. He struggles doing so however, taking too long changing into his costume, which results in the old man eventually getting shot and killed, with the mugger having already fled. Deadpool decides to do small talk with the corpse of the old man, and starts to eat the ice-cream that was part of his groceries.\n\n| Cast                    = * [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (Earth-10005 Revised)|Deadpool (Wade Wilson)]]\n* [[Stan Lee]] as [[Stan Lee (Earth-10005 Revised)|himself]]\n\n==Videos==\n<gallery widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nNo Good Deed\n</gallery>\n\n| Notes                   = * This short film was originally shot to be shown as a teaser before the theatrical runs of {{ml|Logan (film)}}, and was later uploaded as an extended version by Ryan Reynolds on YouTube.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ezsReZcxU Deadpool: No Good Deed] on [https://www.youtube.com YouTube]</ref>\n| Trivia                  = * The song that's heard playing when Deadpool runs to the old man's \"rescue,\" is \"{{WP|St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)}}\" by {{WP|John Parr}}, which was the main theme for the 1985 film ''{{WP|St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire}}''.\n| Links                   = * {{Wc|marvel-movies|Deadpool: No Good Deed|Marvel Movies}}}}\n[[Category:Short Films]]"
