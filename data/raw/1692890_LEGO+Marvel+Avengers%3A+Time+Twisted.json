Turns out it was Thanos and he’s partnered with Red Skull to travel back in time to recruit a powerful army of villains, including Iron Monger, Ultron, Hydra…and another Red Skull? It’s now up to Ant-Man and The Avengers to find Thanos and prevent him from changing history and destroying the world. Oh, and reclaim Ant-Man’s van, too. Avengers assemble!''\n\n| Plot                      = '''Part 1: The Van Driver'''\n\nIn Manhattan, Scott Lang leaves a coffee shop carrying several coffees and boxes.

He discovers that his van has been stolen. \n\nOn a tropical desert island (Hydra's secret base), Hydra soldiers and the Chitauri hang out on the resort. Below, Scott's van is playing music, irritating Thanos. Red Skull Thank Thanos for coming to the island but   the sound of the van is annoying. The Chitauri make the van stop and end up opening it, revealing the Quantum Tunnel. Thanos says he will use it to go back in time to gather what he needs to defeat the Avengers and recovering the Infinity Stones. The Chitauri activate the Quantum Tunnel and prepare for the trip. Thanos says that to defeat Iron Man they would need \"Iron against Iron.\" \n\nIn the not so distant past, Pepper leaves Stark Industries and Tony is on guard. the Iron Monger emerges from the ground preparing to attack Pepper. Tony arrives in time and the two battle. Obadiah defeat him and prepares to shoot.\n\n'''Part 2: Red Skull Squared'''\n\nBefore Obadiah can shoot, Tony fires a beam from the Arc Reactor. From a portal, the Chitauri grab Iron Monger and take him away. \n\nIn the present, at Hydra Base, the Chitauri and Iron Monger emerge from the portal created by the Quantum Tunnel. Thanos says that it could give Obadiah a magnificent power to defeat Iron Man. \n\nAt the Avengers Tower, Tony is confused by the van being stolen. the rest of the team enjoys the donuts and coffee. Clint asks Scott if he kept the Quantum Tunnel in the van and he confirms, knowing that they could use it to go back in time and cause a lot of trouble. Tony says that he could have a way to detect quantum fluctuations or Pym particles but Scott shows that they could use the X-Con \"Find My Car\" app. He uses it and discovers that the van is on \"a desert island in the middle of the ocean\", which leaves them confused about who could have taken it and the reason why.\n\nAt Hydra's secret base, while the Chitauri upgrade Iron Monger's armor, Thanos orders  Schmidt to get the Tesseract and not get distracted with his revenge, Schmidt enters the portal created by the Quantum Tunnel. \n\nIn the distant past, in Red Skull's jet, he and Captain America fight for the Tesseract.
