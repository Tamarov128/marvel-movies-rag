According to writer and director [[Simon Kinberg]], the original ending didn't have the entirety of the X-Men assembled together, and the movie's use of characters was similar to ''Civil War'', in the sense that it had a big action action set piece where everyone is involved occurred at the end of the second act, whereas the third act involved fewer characters and a more intimate exploration of their emotions. Kinberg also admitted Jean's sequences in space displaying her full power were reminiscent of some of the visuals in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref>{{cite
