First they briefly meet [[Daily Bugle]] Editor-In-Chief, [[J.J. Jameson]], who believes these villains' existence is the fault of Spider-Man, before encountering their first foe.\n\nThe [[Scorpion]] is swiftly defeated before he can get to the rider, as they use their [[Web-Shooters]] to collapse some rubble above him.\n\nNext, [[Lizard]] reveals his plan to leak his [[Connors Formula|formula]] into the city's water supply, but the Spider-Friends damage some pipes, spraying him with nitrogen gas.\n\n[[Electro]] appears, shocking citizens aboard the subway before being short-circuited by a spray of water.\n\n[[Green Goblin]] then tries to attack the Spider-Friends directly, but Spider-Man grabs on to the bottom of his glider, ripping out important wires and causing the Goblin to crash.\n\nThe Spider-Friends then find the last villain, [[Doctor Octopus]], in his hideout, as his men gather supplies. Thanks to the Spider-Friends' distracting him by knocking down crates, Spider-Man is able to knock out Doctor Octopus with another crate.\n\nAs the Spider-Friends come to the end of the ride, they see the cast of villains, webbed up for collection by law enforcement.\n\n| Cast                    = \n\n| Notes                   = * '''Spider-Man: The Ultimate Ride''' was a motion-based 3D dark ride at {{WP|Marvel Adventure City}}.
