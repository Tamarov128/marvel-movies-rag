experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company, Advanced Idea Mechanics, but is turned down.\nYears later, Stark's experiences during the Chitauri invasion on New York are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend, Pepper Potts. A string of bombings by terrorist \"the Mandarin\" has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. \n\nWhen Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in one such attack, Stark overcomes his stupor and issues a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Potts and Hansen, who had come to warn them, survive the attack. Stark then finds himself in rural Tennessee after his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. followed a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.\n\nTeaming with Harley, a precocious ten-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis, which at this stage of development can cause certain subjects to explosively reject it. After veterans started exploding, their deaths were used to cover up Extremis' flaws by manufacturing a terrorist plot. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Ellen Brandt and Eric Savin attack him.\nWith Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually a British actor, Trevor Slattery, who says that he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his name.\n\nThe Mandarin is a creation of Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals he is the true Mandarin; he has kidnapped Potts and subjected her to Extremis, intending to infuse her with superhuman abilities and turn her against Stark as leverage to gain Stark's aid in fixing Extremis' flaws. Killian kills Maya when she has a change of heart about the plan.\n\nKillian has also manipulated American intelligence agencies regarding the Mandarin's location, luring James Rhodes—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot—into a trap to steal the armor. Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One. Remotely controlling his Iron Man armor, Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis. They trace Killian to an impounded oil drilling platform where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The vice president will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his daughter's disability.\n\nOn the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, and Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons each of his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and leads him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.\n\nAfter the battle, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy each Iron Man suit under Operation Clean Slate protocol as a sign of his intention to devote more time to Potts. The vice president and Slattery are arrested for their crimes. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be Iron Man.\n\nIn the present, Stark wakes up Dr. Bruce Banner, who fell asleep listening at the beginning of Stark's story.\n\nA final title card reads ''Tony Stark will return.''\n\n| Cast                    = \n* {{WP|Robert Downey Jr.}} as  [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Iron Man / Tony Stark]]\n* {{WP|Gwyneth Paltrow}} as  [[Virginia Potts (Earth-199999)|Pepper Potts]]\n* {{WP|Don Cheadle}} as  [[James Rhodes (Earth-199999)|Iron Patriot / Colonel James Rhodes]]\n* {{WP|Guy Pearce}} as  [[Aldrich Killian (Earth-199999)|Aldrich Killian]]\n* {{WP|Rebecca Hall}} as  [[Maya Hansen (Earth-199999)|Dr. Maya Hansen]]\n* {{WP|Stephanie Szostak}} as  [[Ellen Brandt (Earth-199999)|Ellen Brandt]]\n* {{WP|James Badge Dale}} as  [[Eric Savin (Earth-199999)|Eric Savin]]\n* {{WP|William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler}} as  [[Matthew Ellis (Earth-199999)|President Ellis]]\n* {{WP|Miguel Ferrer}} as [[Vice President Rodriguez (Earth-199999)|Vice President Rodriguez]]\n* {{WP|Jon Favreau}} as  [[Harold Hogan (Earth-199999)|Happy Hogan]]\n* {{WP|Ben Kingsley}} as  [[Trevor Slattery (Earth-199999)|The Mandarin / Trevor Slattery]]\n* {{WP|Dale Dickey}} as Mrs. Davis\n* {{WP|Ty Simpkins}} as  [[Harley Keener (Earth-199999)|Harley Keener]]\n\n{{WP|Paul Bettany}} and {{WP|Shaun Toub}} reprise their roles as [[Just A Rather Very Intelligent System (Earth-199999)|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-199999)|Ho Yinsen]]. {{WP|Wang Xueqi}} and {{WP|Fan Bingbing}} portray [[Doctor Wu (Earth-199999)|Doctor Wu]] and his assistant in scenes shot specifically for the Chinese version of the film.

Lee would also have been one of the victims of the tear gas Tony Stark would've used to clear the place to use the communications satellite.\n* [[Maya Hansen (Earth-199999)|Maya Hansen]] was originally supposed to be the main villain of the film. After the script was finished, Black and co-writer {{WP|Drew Pierce}} received a memo from corporates barring the decision out of concerns for the marketability of a female villain. Hansen's role in the film was reduced and Aldrich Killian was used as the main villain instead. Shane's idea to have a female villain pulling the strings behind a male villain took inspiration from the TV series ''{{WP|Remington Steele}}''.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/shane-black-the-nice-guys-iron-man-3/|title=Shane Black On 'The Nice Guys,' Mel Gibson, And Why A Female 'Iron Man 3' Villain's Gender Changed|last=Ryan|first=Mike|work=Uproxx|date=16 May 2016|accessdate=16 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20240825152618/https://uproxx.com/movies/shane-black-the-nice-guys-iron-man-3/|archivedate=August 25, 2023}}\n* A [[Hulkbuster Armor]] was originally going to appear as part of the [[Iron Legion (Earth-199999)|Iron Legion]], but it was eliminated to save the suit for a more featured role.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEhJQmXjK9e/|title=Phil Saunders on Instagram: \"This #hulkbuster was originally done for...\"|work=Instagram|first=Phil|last=Saunders|date=30 August 2020|accessdate=3 September 2020}}\n* Pearce and Black originally wanted to have Happy Hogan watching {{WP|Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC}} in the hospital as a nod to the Jon Favreau's role in the sitcom ''{{WP|Friends}}''.
