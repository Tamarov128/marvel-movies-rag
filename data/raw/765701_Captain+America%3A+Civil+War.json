In the present day 2016, it has been a year since Ultron's destruction. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon in Lagos. Rumlow attempts to kill Rogers by exploding himself but Maximoff accidentally sends him spiralling into a building, causing many casualties.\n\nThe Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross displays the Sokovia Accords to Tony Stark and the Avengers, which have been passed by the United Nations and says that the United Nations will control the team. Stark, Romanoff, James Rhodes and Vision agree with it while Rogers and Wilson disagree. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo kills Barnes' old HYDRA commander and steals his brainwashing book. At a United Nations conference in Vienna, King T'Chaka is killed by a bomb while giving a speech. Barnes is spotted in the security footage and T'Chaka's son T'Challa adopts his Black Panther mantle and vows to kill Barnes. CIA agent Sharon Carter informs Rogers of Barnes' location so he and Wilson attempt to bring him into custody but T'Challa arrives and tries to kill Barnes. The four are taken away by police and Barnes is placed under arrest.\n\nZemo disguises himself as a psychiatrist and while interviewing Barnes he uses the book he stole to brainwash Barnes and send him on a rampage. Rogers and Wilson stop Barnes and go into hiding with him. Upon regaining control of his mind, Barnes revealed that it was Zemo who bombed Vienna and he is seeking the location of the other Winter Soldier assassins. Rogers hires Clinton Barton to break Maximoff, who has been placed under house arrest by Stark, out of Avengers Tower and also recruits Scott Lang. Stark, Vision, Romanoff and Rhodes hire T'Challa and Peter Parker. The two teams battle at Leipzig Airport until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. Vision accidentally blasts Rhodes, fatally wounding him, and Rogers' faction are imprisoned in the Raft. Stark discovers Barnes' innocence and is given his and Rogers' location by Wilson. There, he strikes a truce with the two of them and discover Zemo has murdered all of the Winter Soldiers. They then discover footage of Barnes' 1991 mission and see that he killed Stark's parents. Stark angrily attacks the two of them from keeping the information away from him and emerges as the winner, severing Barnes' robotic arm, although his armour is disabled in the process. Stark judges Rogers unworthy of his shield, so he leaves it behind as he departs with Barnes. Zemo feels he has fulfilled his mission of fracturing the Avengers and attempts suicide, but T'Challa, having followed Stark to Siberia, stops him and has him arrested by the authorities.\n\nStark gives Rhodes exoskeletal leg braces so he can walk again and Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa provides Barnes asylum in Wakanda and puts him in cyrogenic sleep until he can find a cure for his brainwashing. In a post-credits scene, Parker explores the capabilities of the web-shooters given to him by Stark.\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Chris Evans}} as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain

Kevin Feige at first announced \"''Captain America: Serpent Society''\" as the sequel to ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', before eventually revealing the true title of the film after the rest of the planned Phase 3 movies had been unveiled during the same event.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.newsarama.com/22570-marvel-studios-event-live.html|title=Marvel Studios Event|work=Newsarama|first=Tom|last=McLean|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=28 October 2014}}\n* With a worldwide total box office gross of about $1.15 billion, this film became the highest-grossing film of 2016 and the 12th highest-grossing film of all time.{{cite|ref=true|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2016&p=.htm|title= 2016 Yearly Box Office Results|accessdate= 2017-06-03|work= Box Office Mojo}}{{cite|ref=true|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/|title= All Time Worldwide Box Office|accessdate= 2017-11-17|work= Box Office Mojo|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160801231148/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/|archivedate= 2016-08-01}}\n| Trivia                  = * Filming began on April 27, 2015; the same day as 20th Century Fox's Marvel film, ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/592678356497358852|title=Dear beard We had a good run, but this is where I leave you.

The main challenge for Captain America in this climax would've been finding a way to stop the antagonists, which would've been a horde of mindless, yet innocent, civilians.{{cite|ref=true|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/25/captain-america-civil-war-was-almost-zombie-movie|title=Captain America: Civil War was almost a zombie movie|work=EW.com|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=2 September 2016}}\n* In a draft of the movie before Spider-Man's addition into the script, Iron Man was going to travel to San Francisco and recruit Ant-Man into his side instead.{{cite|ref=true|url=https://soundcloud.com/fatmanonbatman/221-infinity-war-writers-stephen-mcfeely-and-christopher-markus|title=221: Infinity War Writers - Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus|work=Fatman on Batman|date=15 June 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}\n* Early into the development of the movie, [[Hope Van Dyne (Earth-199999)|Hope Van Dyne]] was set to make her debut as Wasp.

Downey convinced the Russo brothers to spend more time on Peter's introduction and reintegrate Holland's lines into the script, so they would film them at the very least.
