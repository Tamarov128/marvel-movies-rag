[[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-199999)|Agent Sitwell]] of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is tasked with retrieving the missing item and neutralising the threat posed by the fugitive pair. He finds them in a hotel where he sets a trap and quickly overpowers them. Intrigued by the fact that all of the other recovered Chitauri weapons were rendered inert after the battle, he presses for more information. Desperate to avoid jail the couple plead with him, although Sitwell merely asks them who said anything about jail, pulling out a switchblade.\n\nOnce back at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Agent Sitwell reports to Agent Blake, and meets Blake's challenge about a tardy response time with a challenge of his own. He introduces Benny as the \"latest addition to the R&D think-tank\" and Claire as Blake's \"new protegé\". Blake is left wondering what do with Claire when he quickly establishes that she doesn't even know how to make coffee.\n\n| Cast                    = * Maximiliano Hernández as [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-199999)|Agent Jasper Sitwell]]\n* [[wikipedia:Jesse Bradford|Jesse Bradford]] as [[Benjamin Pollack (Earth-199999)|Benny Pollack]]\n* [[wikipedia:Lizzy Caplan|Lizzy Caplan]] as [[Claire Weiss (Earth-199999)|Claire Weiss]]\n* [[wikipedia:Titus Welliver|Titus Welliver]] as [[Felix Blake (Earth-199999)|Agent Blake]]\n\n| Notes                   = The story takes place during the two weeks following The Battle of New York as depicted at the end of ''[[Marvel's The Avengers]]''.\n| Trivia                  = * The names \"Benny\" and \"Claire\" are an homage to [[wikipedia:Bonnie and Clyde|Bonnie and Clyde]], an infamous bank-robbing duo in the United States during the Great Depression.\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Marvel One-Shots|Marvel Films]]\n}}\n[[Category:Short Films]]\n[[Category:Marvel One-Shots]]"
