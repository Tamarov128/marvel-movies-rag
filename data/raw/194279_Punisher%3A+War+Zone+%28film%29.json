During the course of the massacre, he hideously disfigures overeager gangster Billy Russoti and murders a mafia lackey who turns out to be an undercover FBI agent. Agent Paul Budiansky, the ex-partner of the undercover Fed, joins the NYPD's \"Punisher Task Force\" to help bring Castle to justice, once and for all.\n\nA facially mutilated Russoti recovers from his run-in with the Punisher with revenge on his mind and recruits a massive army of psychotic killers, gangbangers, and mobsters under his new alias \"Jigsaw\". Distraught that he has now become the very evil he swore to battle, Castle is content to hang up his guns and quit the justice business for good. However, plans quickly change once he learns that Jigsaw has kidnapped the surviving wife and child of the dead federal agent.\n\nForced back into the war, the Punisher now has to face off against Jigsaw's formidable army in order to save the lives of an innocent family his actions put in the firing line.\n\n| Cast                    = \n* {{WP|Ray Stevenson}} - [[Francis Castle (Earth-47281)|Punisher (Frank Castle)]] \n* {{WP|Dominic West}} - [[William Russoti (Earth-47281)|Jigsaw (Billy Russoti)]]\n* {{WP|Wayne Knight}} - [[Linus Lieberman (Earth-47281)|Microchip]]\n* {{WP|Colin Salmon}} - [[Paul Budiansky (Earth-47281)|Agent Paul Budiansky]]\n* {{WP|Dash Mihok}} - [[Martin Soap (Earth-47281)|Detective Martin Soap]]\n\n==Gallery==\n===Images===\n====Logos====\n<gallery>\nPunisher War Zone (film) logo 001.png\nPunisher War Zone (film) logo 002.png\nPunisher War Zone (film) logo 003.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Trailer==\n[[File:PUNISHER WAR ZONE TRAILER 4 Jigsaw|center|Punisher: War Zone trailer]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The film was released by [[Marvel Knights (Imprint)|Marvel Knights]] Pictures, an offshoot of Marvel Studios dealing with movies for mature audiences.\n* The '''Punisher: War Zone''' film is heavily based on {{cl|Punisher Vol 7}}, a comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics]] under the [[MAX]] imprint.\n* ''Days of Revenge'' song by Ramallah band was used in the Comic-Con trailer.\n* This film was originally meant to be a sequel to [[The Punisher (2004 film)|the 2004 film]].
