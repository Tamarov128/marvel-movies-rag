Though unsuccessful, Peter tries to hide the fact that his identity was exposed from Aunt May and Happy Hogan. Peter Parker, MJ, his best friend Ned Leeds, and his Aunt May are questioned by Damage Control. Parker's lawyer Matt Murdock has Parker cleared of all his charges but they are received negatively by the public. Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are denied due to the recent \"controversy\" surrounding them so Parker visits Stephen Strange at the New York Sanctum to ask him to wipe the world's memory of his secret identity. Strange begins the spell but due to Parker repeatedly asking him to alter the spell so his loved ones can know and gets out of control. Strange manages to close the spell and makes Parker leave. \n\nParker asks an MIT administrator to reconsider denying the applications of his friends but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius' tentacles bond with Parker's nanotechnology, allowing Parker to disable them. Norman Osborn then arrives but he and Octavius are teleported back to the New York Sanctum and Octavius is placed in a cell. Strange reveals he has also imprisoned Curt Connors and reveals that the spell he casted caused people who knew Spider-Man's identity to cross over from other universes. He then tells Parker, MJ, and Ned to bring back the other villains. Parker manages to retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko. \n\nOsborn regains control from his Green Goblin persona and finds May, who comforts him until Parker arrives. Parker learns from the villains that most of them were taken from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to send the villains back and meet their fates but Parker disagrees and fights Strange, eventually stealing the spell and leaving him trapped in the Mirror Dimension. Parker and May then take the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment, and Parker manages to cure Octavius but Osborn's Green Goblin persona comes into control again and convinces the other uncured villains to betray Parker. Before the villains escape, Green Goblin fatally impales May with his glider, and as she dies in Parker's arms she tells him \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\". \n\nNed discovers he can open portals with Strange's sling ring and attempts to locate Parker, only to accidentally bring over alternate versions of him from the same universes as the villains. The two Spider-Men find Parker and tell him how they lost their lost ones, convincing him not to give up. Green Goblin and Marko's Spider-Man is nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and Connor and Dillon's Spider-Man is nicknamed \"Peter-Three\". The three Spider-Men develop cures for the villains and lure them to the Statue of Liberty, where they are assisted by Ned, MJ, and Octavius in fighting them. \n\nMarko is second to be cured by Peter-Two at the top of the Statue of Liberty. Dillon is cured with the help of Octavius and is convinced to give up his villainous tendencies by Peter-Three. As Peter-One cures Connors, Ned uses a portal to free Strange from the Mirror Dimension. Peter-Two and Octavius are reunited and have a heart-felt reunion together. A furious Strange takes back the Macchina di Kadavus however The Green Goblin arrives and destroys the contained spell, which starts to bring in more people from different universes. Parker angrily tries to kill Green Goblin to avenge his Aunt May but he is calmed down by the Spider-Man from Goblin's universe Peter-Two, who is then stabbed in the back by Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject Goblin with the cure, freeing Osborn from the Goblin forever. Parker realizes the only way to save the multiverse is by making the world completely forget his existence, and has Strange cast a spell to do so. As he says his final goodbyes to his friends, he promises to find them again. Strange's spell also sends the alternate Spider-Man and the redeemed villains back to their universes. Two weeks later, Parker decides Ned and MJ's lives are better without him and does not remind them of who he is. He then visits May's graves and makes a homemade suit for himself, continuing independent crime-fighting to honour his aunt's memories. \n\nIn a post-credit scene, Eddie Brock is returned to his universe as a result of Strange's spell but inadvertently leaves a part of the Venom symbiote behind.\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Tom Holland}} as [[Peter Parker (Earth-199999)|Spider-Man / Peter Parker]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Spider-Man Return|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/sony-marvel-tom-holland-spider-man-1203351489/|title=Spider-Man Will Stay in the Marvel Cinematic Universe|first=Brent|last=Lang|work=Variety|date=27 September 2019|accessdate=25 February 2021}}\n\n* {{WP|Andrew Garfield}} as [[Peter Parker (Earth-120703)|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)-120703]]\n\n* {{WP|Tobey Maguire}} as [[Peter Parker (Earth-96283)|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)-96283]]\n\n* {{WP|Zendaya}} as [[Michelle Jones (Earth-199999)|Michelle \"MJ\" Jones]]\n\n* {{WP|Jacob Batalon}} as [[Edward Leeds (Earth-199999)|Ned Leeds]]{{cite|ref=true|refname=Doctor Strange|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/benedict-cumberbatch-joins-spider-man-3-as-doctor-strange-exclusive|title= Benedict Cumberbatch Joins ‘Spider-Man 3’ as Doctor Strange (Exclusive)|work= THR|last= Kit|first= Borys|date= October 8, 2020|accessdate= February 24, 2021}}\n\n* {{WP|Marisa Tomei}} as [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-199999)|Aunt May Parker]]\n\n* {{WP|Jamie Foxx}} as [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-TRN929)|Electro / Max Dillon]]{{cite|ref=true|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-3-jolt-jamie-foxx-returning-as-electro-exclusive|title= 'Spider-Man 3' Jolt: Jamie Foxx Returning as Electro (Exclusive)|work= THR|last= Kit|first= Borys|date= October 1, 2020|accessdate= February 24, 2021}}\n\n* {{WP|Benedict Cumberbatch}} as [[Stephen Strange (Earth-199999)|Doctor Strange / Stephen Strange]]<ref name=\"Doctor Strange\"/>\n\n* {{WP|Willem Dafoe}} as [[Norman Osborn (Earth-TRN925)|Green Goblin / Norman Osborn]]\n** Dafoe was digitally de-aged to resemble the character's 2002 self.\n\n* {{WP|Alfred Molina}} as [[Otto Octavius (Earth-TRN926)|Doctor Octopus / Otto Octavius]]{{cite|ref=true|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-3-alfred-molina-returning-as-doctor-octopus|title= 'Spider-Man 3': Alfred Molina Returning as Doctor Octopus|work= THR|last= Couch|first= Aaron|coauthors= Kit, Borys|date= December 8, 2020|accessdate= February 24, 2021}}\n** In response to Molina's confusion about the fate of Doctor Octopus from the film {{sl|Spider-Man 2 (film)}}, director [[Jon Watts]] told Molina, “In this universe, no one really dies.” Early conversations Molina and Watts had about ''Spider-Man: No Way Home'' had his character pick up from his death in ''Spider-Man 2''.

This quote is lifted directly from {{sl|Spider-Man (2002 film)}} where Osborn says the same quote to [[Peter Parker (Earth-96283)|Peter-Two]].\n** Similarly, Octavius is quoted multiple times as saying ''The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand'', a phrase he commonly used to describe his reactor in {{sl|Spider-Man 2 (film)}}.\n** As MJ is falling from the Statue of Liberty, Parker initially fails in catching her but she is instead caught by [[Peter Parker (Earth-120703)|Peter-Three]]. This is a reference to {{sl|The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (film)}} in which Peter-Three failed to catch [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-120703)|Gwen Stacy]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Alternate Posters===\n<gallery>\nSpider-Man No Way Home Logo.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home banner 001.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 001.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 001 textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 002.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 002 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 003 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 004.png\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 004 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 005.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 005 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 010.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 010 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 011.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 011 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 006.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 007.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 007 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 008.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 008 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 009.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 009 Textless.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 012.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 013.jpg\nSpider-Man No Way Home poster 013 textless.jpg\n</gallery>\n===Videos===\n====Trailers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSPIDER-MAN- NO WAY HOME - Official Teaser Trailer\nSPIDER-MAN- NO WAY HOME - Official Trailer\n</gallery>\n====Teasers====\n<gallery position=\"center\" widths=\"300\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nThe New Spider-Man Title is…\n</gallery>\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* {{Marvel Cinematic Universe|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}\n}}\n[[es:Spider-Man: Sin Camino a Casa]]\n[[it:Spider-Man: No Way Home]]\n[[tr:Örümcek-Adam: Eve Dönüş Yok]]\n[[Ru:Человек-паук: Нет пути домой]]\n[[fi:Spider-Man: No Way Home]]\n\n[[Category:Marvel Studios]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Entertainment]]"
