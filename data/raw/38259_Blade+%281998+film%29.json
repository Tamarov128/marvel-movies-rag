In the process of trying to revive her, she gives birth to her baby boy and dies. The next scene proceeds to the present and continues with a seductive woman bringing an unsuspecting man to a strange nightclub. As the scene progresses, the man realizes something is amiss in the club yet cannot quite discern ''why''. However, his fears are soon confirmed when blood begins to pour down from the sprinkler system, revealing all of the club's patrons to be vampires. Unable to escape from the hideous creatures which have now surrounded him, the young man seems doomed until one of the vampires draws attention to an individual who has just entered -the \"''Daywalker''\".\n\nBlade coolly enters the main dance floor, causing frantic panic amongst the vampire crowd. He immediately begins a no-holds-barred slaughter of the vampires, using a combination of martial arts and firearms to pick them off. Eventually, after fighting his way through numerous guards, Blade singles out one vampire, in particular, named Quinn, nailing him to the wall with stakes and setting him alight. Upon hearing police sirens, Blade turns to Quinn and tells him \"Give my regards to Frost\", leaving a burnt Quinn along with the confused human as the only surviving inhabitants of his attack. The police take Quinn's crisp remains and send them for identification.\n\nDoctor Karen Jenson is the unlucky individual who performs the examination on Quinn's \"''corpse''\". During the examination, Quinn shockingly returns to life and feeds on both Jenson and her co-worker. However, Blade enters the morgue, having pre-supposed that Quinn would come back. He attacks the rejuvenated vampire but is yet again forced to flee when the police arrive. As he makes to leave, Blade sees a bleeding Doctor Jensen lying on the floor, beckoning for him to help her. Due to some instant emotional attachment (the doctor reminds him of his mother), Blade rescues Jensen and they head back to his base of operations. Quinn also escapes from the attack.\n\nThe scene changes to the meeting room of The House of Erebus, a vampire Shadow Council. The Elder Dragonetti discusses Blade's recent intensified attacks and berates a young Deacon Frost for his recklessness in running these clubs. During this scene, there is a short explanation of vampire politics - most vampires believe that they should more or less co-exist with the humans (maintaining a secret, Mafia-like power cabal), whilst renegades such as Frost believe they should ''rule'' them outright. It is also established that there is some stigma from \"pure-blood\" vampires (i.e. those who are born vampires) towards those born human and later ''turned'' into vampires.\n\nThe storyline switches back to Blade's lair, where Jenson meets Abraham Whistler, Blade's mentor and weapons technician in their fight against vampire-kind. Whistler delivers a small speech outlining Blade's past, their current mission and the nature of vampires, along with the power they hold in the outside world. Jenson decides to head home, although Blade reminds her this is a possibility that due to Quinn's bite, she too may become a vampire. It is also established in this scene that Blade is a half-vampire, and requires a serum to prevent his need to drink blood. Jenson begins to work on a permanent cure for the vampire condition, using Whistler's research as her starting ground.\n\nUpon arriving in her apartment, Jenson is assaulted by a policeman who is revealed to be a ''familiar'' - a human being who serves vampires (a collaborator, essentially, that after years of service might get rewarded by being turned into a vampire). Blade rescues Jenson and later follows the familiar back to another club of Frost's, there discovering that Frost has plans involving a vampire blood-god named La Magra. Although Blade and Jenson are assaulted by Frost's private army, they escape due to the timely arrival of Whistler.\n\nHowever, shortly after this, Frost makes a second strike. Whilst Blade heads out to fetch the ingredients for his serum, Frost abducts Dr. Jenson from the lair and badly beats Whistler, letting Quinn and the rest of his crew finish him off. Upon Blade's return, he finds a taunting video left from Frost. In a poignant scene, Blade aids Whistler in suicide (Blade hears a gunshot from outside but doesn't see it happen). Stricken with grief, Blade vows to find and kill Frost. During this time, Frost kills Elder Dragonetti by subjecting him to a sunrise, and forcibly gathers the other members of the Shadow Council as \"''volunteers''\".\n\nBlade then arms himself for a raid on Frost's base, taking along with him specially-designed pneumatic syringes loaded with EDTA (normally used as a blood thinner to clear blood clots in the heart, which has a highly volatile reaction to vampire blood). During his attack on the base, Blade fights his way through a horde of vampires, yet discovers a horrible truth once he reaches the top floor of the building. He learns that his mother (the pregnant woman from the flashback scene) did not in fact die, and is now Frost's vampire mistress, as it was Frost himself who had bitten his mother during her pregnancy. Overcome with shock, Blade is easily subdued by the guards, who knock him out and take him to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost reveals the final stages of his plan.\n\nUsing his resources and vast wealth, Frost has managed to rebuild the temple and intends to use it for La Magra's resurrection, a key ingredient of which is Blade's sunlight-resistant vampiric blood, along with the sacrifice of the other twelve council members (who were all members of the leading vampire noble houses). Through the ritual, Frost becomes an eminently more powerful vampire, far surpassing any other vampire's strength or speed, and gains the powers of each sacrificed member, such as immunity to silver, and red, bulging eyes (from the Kobejitsu tribe). Blade breaks free from his sacrificial housing, killing his mother and draining Dr. Jenson to renew his strength. After Blade disposes of Frost's minions, the two meet for one final climactic battle at the base of the temple. Upon discovering that Frost cannot be killed by any conventional means, Blade empties every single EDTA syringe he has on Frost (who's now constituted entirely of vampire blood), causing him to explode violently.\n\nClimbing out from the underground temple, Karen offers Blade her cure. Blade refuses, because \"curing\" him of his need for blood would also remove his Daywalker powers and he would be unable to hunt vampires, and requests for her to make him a better serum, reminding her that \"''there's still a war going on''\". The final scene shows Blade in Moscow, hunting down and killing a Russian vampire who has persuaded a human to follow him to a vampire club.\n\n| Cast                    = * [[wikipedia:Wesley Snipes|Wesley Snipes]] as [[Eric Brooks (Earth-26320)|Blade / Eric Brooks]]\n* [[wikipedia:Stephen Dorff|Stephen Dorff]] as [[Deacon Frost (Earth-26320)|Deacon Frost]]\n* [[wikipedia:Kris Kristofferson|Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler (Earth-26320)|Abraham Whistler]]\n* [[wikipedia:N'Bushe Wright|N'Bushe Wright]] as [[Karen Jenson (Earth-26320)|Dr. Karen Jenson]]\n* [[wikipedia:Donal Logue|Donal Logue]] as [[Quinn (Earth-26320)|Quinn]]\n* [[wikipedia:Udo Kier|Udo Kier]] as [[Gitano Dragonetti (Earth-26320)|Vampire Elder Dragonetti]]\n* [[wikipedia:Arly Jover|Arly Jover]] as [[Mercury (Earth-26320)|Mercury]]\n* [[wikipedia:Traci Lords|Traci Lords]] as [[Racquel (Earth-26320)|Racquel]]\n* [[wikipedia:Kevin Patrick Walls|Kevin Patrick Walls]] as [[Officer Krieger (Earth-26320)|Officer Krieger]]\n* [[wikipedia:Tim Guinee|Tim Guinee]] as [[Curtis Webb (Earth-26320)|Dr. Curtis Webb]]\n* [[wikipedia:Sanaa Lathan|Sanaa Lathan]] as [[Vanessa Brooks (Earth-26320)|Vanessa Brooks]]\n* Eric Edwards as [[Pearl (Earth-26320)|Pearl]]\n\nAdditionally, [[wikipedia:Shannon Lee|Shannon Lee]] portrays a resident.

It was directed by [[wikipedia:Stephen Norrington|Stephen Norrington]] and written by David Goyer. Snipes plays the character of Blade, a half-man, half-vampire, vampire hunter who becomes the protector of humans against the vampires. It spawned two sequels: ''[[Blade II (film)|Blade II]]'' was released in 2002 and ''[[Blade: Trinity (film)|Blade: Trinity]]'', was released in 2004.\n\n{{YouTube|'''Blade Trailer'''|[[File:\"Blade (1998)\" Theatrical Trailer|400px]]|406\n}}\n\n'''Taglines:'''\n* ''Against an army of immortals, one warrior must draw first blood.''\n* ''Part Man. Part Vampire. All Hero.''\n\n===Origins===\nThe character [[Blade]] was created in 1973 for [[Marvel Comics]] by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] and was a supporting character in the 1970s comic ''[[Tomb of Dracula Vol 1|Tomb of Dracula]]''. In the comic, Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire while she was in labor with Blade. Thus, Blade was born as a dhampir, a human with vampire genes.\n\n===Traits===\nIn the film, [[Deacon Frost (Earth-26320)|Deacon Frost]] says that Blade \"possesses all of the strengths of a vampire, but none of their weaknesses.\"  This is not entirely true, since he lusts for blood (though most vampires may not consider that a \"weakness\"), and he ages at the same rate as human, opposed to true vampires which can live indefinitely.  Despite this, he does have numerous abilities. Among these powers are enhanced strength, dexterity, and senses. He speaks Czech, Russian and to a degree the Vampire language, and has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires.\n\n===La Magra===\nOne of the major plots of the film was to prevent Frost from raising La Magra, the Vampire blood god, and causing a vampire apocalypse. When Frost successfully became La Magra, he gained certain powers, making him almost invincible. Each ability he gained were from the twelve pure bloods (Ashe, Cianteto, Dragonetti, Faustinas who held two seats, Ligaroo, Lemure, Kobejitsu, Lobishomen, Von Esper, Upier, and Pallantine) sacrificed in the ritual. Some of those powers/abilities include:\n* Far superior strength and speed from that of a regular vampire.\n* Red, bulging eyes.\n* Instant regeneration of lost limbs.\n* Impervious to silver.\n* The ability to walk during the day due to Blade's blood.\n* Can instantly turn any human in his path into vampires. (This comes to debate since Dr. Karen Jenson was in the same area where La Magra and Blade's battle took place and was not instantly turned, though it's a probability that La Magra needs to concentrate his powers in order to make the turning possible.)\n* Can control minds, matter and the elements. (Gained from the Faustinas tribe)\n* Can shed his skin, turning into a ball of fire to methodically stalk his prey. (Gained from the Ligaroo tribe)\n\nThe majority of these powers were never seen or mentioned in the film since Frost's reign as La Magra was short-lived, but it is believed that since all of the pure bloods' spirits lived within Frost's body, he would gain their abilities as well.\n\n===Filmtracks===\nThese [http://www.cine-score.com/detailquery_film.php?film_id=20&filmname=Blade songs] listed are heard within the film only.

Goyer's mind, Snipes was always the perfect choice for the character of Blade.\n\n==Technical Details==\n'''Sound Mix:'''\n*Dolby Digital\n*SDDS\n*DTS-Stereo\n*Dolby Atmos\n'''Aspect Ratio:''' 2.39 : 1\n\n'''Cameras:'''\n* Arriflex 35-III, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series, Todd-AO, Nikon Nikkor and Canon lenses.\n* Moviecam Compact, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series, Todd-AO, Cooke Varotal, Angenieux HR, Nikon Nikkor and Canon lenses.\n* Moviecam SL, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series and Todd-AO lenses.\n'''Negative Format:'''\n* 35mm, using Eastman EXR 100T 5248, Kodak Vision 320T 5277, Vision 500T 5279, and EXR 200T 5293 film stocks.\n'''Cinematographic Process:'''\n* Arriscope (anamorphic)\n* Clairmont-Scope (anamorphic)\n* Hawk Scope (anamorphic)\n* Todd-AO 35 (anamorphic)\n* Digital Intermediate (4K, 2020 remaster)\n'''Printed Film Format:'''\n* 35mm Fuji F-CP 3519 film stock.\n| Trivia                  = * The original ending included an eight-story monstrous version of La Magra. This was scrapped and re-done to the current known ending after many fans were disappointed when Stephen Dorff (Frost) was taken off-camera during the film's first screening. The original ending can be found in the special features section in the DVD version of the film.\n* The movie features Traci Lords, the former pornographic actress, as Racquel, a vampire who is shown covered in blood in one notable scene during the opening half of the film.\n* Bruce Lee's daughter Shannon Lee appears very briefly as a resident in the opening scene when Blade's mother is taken into hospital and about to give birth to him.\n* A video game for PlayStation entitled ''[[Blade (video game)|Blade]]'' was released in 2000 based on the characters of the film.\n* An alternate ending on the DVD featured director Stephen Norrington as a character costumed in dark clothing, and observing Blade from afar. This character was later confirmed to be [[Morbius|Michael Morbius]], with this alternate ending setting him up as the original villain of the sequel.<ref>From interview with David Goyer, [http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=1082David \"Goyer: Stripped to the Bone\"]</ref>\n| Links                   = * [[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* {{imdb title|id=0120611|title=Blade}}\n* {{Marvel Movies|Blade (1998 film)}}\n}}<h2 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">Appearances</h2><div class=\"marvel_database_section\">\n'''Featured Characters:'''\n*[[Eric Brooks (Earth-26320)|Blade (Eric Brooks)]] [[Category:Eric Brooks (Earth-26320)/Appearances]]  <span class=\"green_text\">(First appearance)</span>\n'''Supporting Characters:'''\n*[[Karen Jenson (Earth-26320)|Dr. Karen Jenson]] [[Category:Karen Jenson (Earth-26320)/Appearances]]  <span class=\"green_text\">(First appearance)</span>\n*[[Abraham Whistler (Earth-26320)|Abraham Whistler]] [[Category:Abraham Whistler (Earth-26320)/Appearances]]  <span class=\"green_text\">(First appearance)</span>  <span class=\"green_text\">(Apparent death)</span>\n'''Antagonists:'''\n*[[House of Erebus (Earth-26320)|The House of Erebus]] [[Category:House of Erebus (Earth-26320)/Appearances]]  <span class=\"green_text\">(First appearance)</span>\n**[[Vanessa Brooks (Earth-26320)|Vanessa Brooks]] [[Category:Vanessa Brooks (Earth-26320)/Appearances]]  <span class=\"green_text\">(First appearance;

Jenson begins to work on a permanent cure for the vampire condition, using Whistler's research as her starting ground.\n\nUpon arriving in her apartment, Jenson is assaulted by a policeman who is revealed to be a ''familiar'' - a human being who serves vampires (a collaborator, essentially, that after years of service might get rewarded by being turned into a vampire). Blade rescues Jenson and later follows the familiar back to another club of Frost's, there discovering that Frost has plans involving a vampire blood-god named La Magra. Although Blade and Jenson are assaulted by Frost's private army, they escape due to the timely arrival of Whistler.\n\nHowever, shortly after this, Frost makes a second strike. Whilst Blade heads out to fetch the ingredients for his serum, Frost abducts Dr. Jenson from the lair and badly beats Whistler, letting Quinn and the rest of his crew finish him off. Upon Blade's return, he finds a taunting video left from Frost. In a poignant scene, Blade aids Whistler in suicide (Blade hears a gunshot from outside but doesn't see it happen). Stricken with grief, Blade vows to find and kill Frost. During this time, Frost kills Elder Dragonetti by subjecting him to a sunrise, and forcibly gathers the other members of the Shadow Council as \"''volunteers''\".\n\nBlade then arms himself for a raid on Frost's base, taking along with him specially-designed pneumatic syringes loaded with EDTA (normally used as a blood thinner to clear blood clots in the heart, which has a highly volatile reaction to vampire blood). During his attack on the base, Blade fights his way through a horde of vampires, yet discovers a horrible truth once he reaches the top floor of the building. He learns that his mother (the pregnant woman from the flashback scene) did not in fact die, and is now Frost's vampire mistress, as it was Frost himself who had bitten his mother during her pregnancy. Overcome with shock, Blade is easily subdued by the guards, who knock him out and take him to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost reveals the final stages of his plan.\n\nUsing his resources and vast wealth, Frost has managed to rebuild the temple and intends to use it for La Magra's resurrection, a key ingredient of which is Blade's sunlight-resistant vampiric blood, along with the sacrifice of the other twelve council members (who were all members of the leading vampire noble houses). Through the ritual, Frost becomes an eminently more powerful vampire, far surpassing any other vampire's strength or speed, and gains the powers of each sacrificed member, such as immunity to silver, and red, bulging eyes (from the Kobejitsu tribe). Blade breaks free from his sacrificial housing, killing his mother and draining Dr. Jenson to renew his strength. After Blade disposes of Frost's minions, the two meet for one final climactic battle at the base of the temple. Upon discovering that Frost cannot be killed by any conventional means, Blade empties every single EDTA syringe he has on Frost (who's now constituted entirely of vampire blood), causing him to explode violently.\n\nClimbing out from the underground temple, Karen offers Blade her cure. Blade refuses, because \"curing\" him of his need for blood would also remove his Daywalker powers and he would be unable to hunt vampires, and requests for her to make him a better serum, reminding her that \"''there's still a war going on''\". The final scene shows Blade in Moscow, hunting down and killing a Russian vampire who has persuaded a human to follow him to a vampire club.</div><span></span><h2 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">Cast</h2><div class=\"marvel_database_section\">\n*[[wikipedia:Wesley Snipes|Wesley Snipes]] as [[Eric Brooks (Earth-26320)|Blade / Eric Brooks]]\n*[[wikipedia:Stephen Dorff|Stephen Dorff]] as [[Deacon Frost (Earth-26320)|Deacon Frost]]\n*[[wikipedia:Kris Kristofferson|Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler (Earth-26320)|Abraham Whistler]]\n*[[wikipedia:N'Bushe Wright|N'Bushe Wright]] as [[Karen Jenson (Earth-26320)|Dr. Karen Jenson]]\n*[[wikipedia:Donal Logue|Donal Logue]] as [[Quinn (Earth-26320)|Quinn]]\n*[[wikipedia:Udo Kier|Udo Kier]] as [[Gitano Dragonetti (Earth-26320)|Vampire Elder Dragonetti]]\n*[[wikipedia:Arly Jover|Arly Jover]] as [[Mercury (Earth-26320)|Mercury]]\n*[[wikipedia:Traci Lords|Traci Lords]] as [[Racquel (Earth-26320)|Racquel]]\n*[[wikipedia:Kevin Patrick Walls|Kevin Patrick Walls]] as [[Officer Krieger (Earth-26320)|Officer Krieger]]\n*[[wikipedia:Tim Guinee|Tim Guinee]] as [[Curtis Webb (Earth-26320)|Dr. Curtis Webb]]\n*[[wikipedia:Sanaa Lathan|Sanaa Lathan]] as [[Vanessa Brooks (Earth-26320)|Vanessa Brooks]]\n*Eric Edwards as [[Pearl (Earth-26320)|Pearl]]\n\nAdditionally, [[wikipedia:Shannon Lee|Shannon Lee]] portrays a resident.

It was directed by [[wikipedia:Stephen Norrington|Stephen Norrington]] and written by David Goyer. Snipes plays the character of Blade, a half-man, half-vampire, vampire hunter who becomes the protector of humans against the vampires. It spawned two sequels: ''[[Blade II (film)|Blade II]]'' was released in 2002 and ''[[Blade: Trinity (film)|Blade: Trinity]]'', was released in 2004.\n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\" style=\"width:406\npx;\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\">'''Blade Trailer'''</div>\n[[File:\"Blade (1998)\" Theatrical Trailer|400px]]\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n'''Taglines:'''\n*''Against an army of immortals, one warrior must draw first blood.''\n*''Part Man. Part Vampire. All Hero.''\n\n===Origins===\nThe character [[Blade]] was created in 1973 for [[Marvel Comics]] by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] and was a supporting character in the 1970s comic ''[[Tomb of Dracula Vol 1|Tomb of Dracula]]''. In the comic, Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire while she was in labor with Blade. Thus, Blade was born as a dhampir, a human with vampire genes.\n\n===Traits===\nIn the film, [[Deacon Frost (Earth-26320)|Deacon Frost]] says that Blade \"possesses all of the strengths of a vampire, but none of their weaknesses.\"  This is not entirely true, since he lusts for blood (though most vampires may not consider that a \"weakness\"), and he ages at the same rate as human, opposed to true vampires which can live indefinitely.  Despite this, he does have numerous abilities. Among these powers are enhanced strength, dexterity, and senses. He speaks Czech, Russian and to a degree the Vampire language, and has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires.\n\n===La Magra===\nOne of the major plots of the film was to prevent Frost from raising La Magra, the Vampire blood god, and causing a vampire apocalypse. When Frost successfully became La Magra, he gained certain powers, making him almost invincible. Each ability he gained were from the twelve pure bloods (Ashe, Cianteto, Dragonetti, Faustinas who held two seats, Ligaroo, Lemure, Kobejitsu, Lobishomen, Von Esper, Upier, and Pallantine) sacrificed in the ritual. Some of those powers/abilities include:\n*Far superior strength and speed from that of a regular vampire.\n*Red, bulging eyes.\n*Instant regeneration of lost limbs.\n*Impervious to silver.\n*The ability to walk during the day due to Blade's blood.\n*Can instantly turn any human in his path into vampires. (This comes to debate since Dr. Karen Jenson was in the same area where La Magra and Blade's battle took place and was not instantly turned, though it's a probability that La Magra needs to concentrate his powers in order to make the turning possible.)\n*Can control minds, matter and the elements. (Gained from the Faustinas tribe)\n*Can shed his skin, turning into a ball of fire to methodically stalk his prey. (Gained from the Ligaroo tribe)\n\nThe majority of these powers were never seen or mentioned in the film since Frost's reign as La Magra was short-lived, but it is believed that since all of the pure bloods' spirits lived within Frost's body, he would gain their abilities as well.\n\n===Filmtracks===\nThese [http://www.cine-score.com/detailquery_film.php?film_id=20&filmname=Blade songs] listed are heard within the film only.

Goyer's mind, Snipes was always the perfect choice for the character of Blade.\n\n==Technical Details==\n'''Sound Mix:'''\n*Dolby Digital\n*SDDS\n*DTS-Stereo\n*Dolby Atmos\n'''Aspect Ratio:''' 2.39 : 1\n\n'''Cameras:'''\n*Arriflex 35-III, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series, Todd-AO, Nikon Nikkor and Canon lenses.\n*Moviecam Compact, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series, Todd-AO, Cooke Varotal, Angenieux HR, Nikon Nikkor and Canon lenses.\n*Moviecam SL, using Arriscope, Clairmont, Hawk C-Series and Todd-AO lenses.\n'''Negative Format:'''\n*35mm, using Eastman EXR 100T 5248, Kodak Vision 320T 5277, Vision 500T 5279, and EXR 200T 5293 film stocks.\n'''Cinematographic Process:'''\n*Arriscope (anamorphic)\n*Clairmont-Scope (anamorphic)\n*Hawk Scope (anamorphic)\n*Todd-AO 35 (anamorphic)\n*Digital Intermediate (4K, 2020 remaster)\n'''Printed Film Format:'''\n*35mm Fuji F-CP 3519 film stock.</div><span></span><h2 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">Trivia</h2><div class=\"marvel_database_section\">\n*The original ending included an eight-story monstrous version of La Magra. This was scrapped and re-done to the current known ending after many fans were disappointed when Stephen Dorff (Frost) was taken off-camera during the film's first screening. The original ending can be found in the special features section in the DVD version of the film.\n*The movie features Traci Lords, the former pornographic actress, as Racquel, a vampire who is shown covered in blood in one notable scene during the opening half of the film.\n*Bruce Lee's daughter Shannon Lee appears very briefly as a resident in the opening scene when Blade's mother is taken into hospital and about to give birth to him.\n*A video game for PlayStation entitled ''[[Blade (video game)|Blade]]'' was released in 2000 based on the characters of the film.\n*An alternate ending on the DVD featured director Stephen Norrington as a character costumed in dark clothing, and observing Blade from afar. This character was later confirmed to be [[Morbius|Michael Morbius]], with this alternate ending setting him up as the original villain of the sequel.<ref>From interview with David Goyer, [http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=1082David \"Goyer: Stripped to the Bone\"]</ref></div><span></span><h2 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">See Also</h2><span></span>\n*[[:Category:Blade (1998 film)/Images|23 image(s) from Blade (1998 film)]]\n<span></span><h2 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">Links and References</h2><span></span>\n*[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611 Blade] on [http://www.imdb.com IMDB.com]\n*[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/blade-v158809 Blade] on [http://www.allmovie.com AllMovie.com]\n*[[w:c:marvel-movies:Blade (1998)|Blade]] on [[w:c:marvel-movies|Marvel Movies wiki]]\n*[[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n*[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/ ''Blade''] at the [[wikipedia:Internet Movie Database|Internet Movie Database]]\n*[[w:c:marvelmovies:Blade (1998 film)|Blade (1998 film)]] on [[Image:Marvel Movies.png|120px| link=w:c:marvelmovies]]\n<span></span><h3 class=\"marvel_database_header\" style=\"text-align:left\">References</h3><span></span><div style=\"overflow:auto;height:auto;max-height:250px;width:99%;font-size:12px;border:1px solid #AAAAAA\"><references group=\"note\" /><references /></div>\n[[Category:1998, August]]\n[[ru:Блэйд (фильм)]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema]]"
