While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the X-Men's [[Marie D'Ancanto (Earth-10005)|Rogue]], many others are horrified by the announcement. In response to the news, the X-Men's adversary [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-10005)|Magneto]] raises an army, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to eradicate all mutant powers.\n\n[[Scott Summers (Earth-10005)|Cyclops]], haunted by the memory of the dead Jean Grey, returns to the place where Jean had sacrificed herself to save the X-Men. Jean appears to Cyclops, and as the two kiss, Jean changes and appears to kill Cyclops. Sensing trouble, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-10005)|Professor Charles Xavier]] sends [[James Howlett (Earth-10005)|Wolverine]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-10005)|Storm]] to investigate. When they arrive, the two X-Men encounter telekinetically floating rocks, Cyclops' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.\n\nXavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself, she unleashed the powerful alternate personality she calls \"[[Phoenix Force|Phoenix]]\". Wolverine is disgusted to learn that Xavier has kept Jean in check telepathically, but when Jean awakens, he realizes she is not the Jean Grey he knew. Jean pleads with Wolverine to kill her, but when he refuses, the Phoenix surfaces and telekinetically slams Wolverine into a wall. She then escapes to her childhood home.\n\nMagneto, also aware that Jean is now a [[Mutants (Homo superior)|powerful]] mutant, meets Xavier at Jean's house. The two men vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces, unleashing her power. She destroys her family's house, disintegrates Xavier, and leaves with Magneto. \n\nFollowing the loss of Xavier, the X-Men regroup and confront Magneto's army, which is attacking the pharmaceutical company. During the fight, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-10005)|Beast]] injects Magneto with the cure, nullifying his mutant powers. After the battle, the Phoenix emerges and begins to destroy everything around her.  Momentarily gaining control, Jean begs Wolverine to save her. Telling Jean he loves her, Wolverine reluctantly kills her with his claws. \n\nDespite the X-Men's losses, life goes on. Magneto, now an ordinary man, sits at a chessboard and reaches out toward a metal chess piece that trembles slightly, hinting that the cure may not be as permanent as thought. Following the end credits, [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-10005)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]] checks on a comatose patient, P. Xavier, Charles' brother. He calls out to her with Charles's voice. Startled, she replies, \"Charles?\"\n\n| Cast                    = * {{WP|Hugh Jackman}} as [[James Howlett (Earth-10005)|Wolverine / Logan]]\n* {{WP|Halle Berry}} as [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-10005)|Storm / Ororo Munroe]]\n* {{WP|Ian McKellen}} as [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-10005)|Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr]]\n* {{WP|Famke Janssen}} as [[Jean Grey (Earth-10005)|Phoenix / Jean Grey]]\n** {{WP|Haley Ramm}} portrays a young Jean Grey\n* {{WP|Anna Paquin}} as [[Marie D'Ancanto (Earth-10005)|Rogue / Marie]]\n* {{WP|Kelsey Grammer}} as [[Henry McCoy (Earth-10005)|Beast / Dr. Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]]\n* {{WP|James Marsden}} as [[Scott Summers (Earth-10005)|Cyclops / Scott Summers]]\n* {{WP|Rebecca Romijn}} as [[Raven Darkhölme (Earth-10005)|Mystique / Raven Darkhölme]]\n* {{WP|Shawn Ashmore}} as [[Robert Drake (Earth-10005)|Iceman / Bobby Drake]]\n* {{WP|Aaron Stanford}} as [[John Allerdyce (Earth-10005)|Pyro / John Allerdyce]]\n* {{WP|Vinnie Jones}} as [[Cain Marko (Earth-10005)|Juggernaut / Cain Marko]]\n* {{WP|Patrick Stewart}} as [[Charles Xavier (Earth-10005)|Professor Charles Xavier]]\n* {{WP|Elliot Page}} as [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-10005)|Kitty Pryde]]\n* {{WP|Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster}} as [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-10005)|Angel / Warren Worthington III]]\n** {{WP|Cayden Boyd}} portrays a young Warren Worthington III\n* {{WP|Dania Ramirez}} as [[Callisto (Earth-10005)|Callisto]]\n* {{WP|Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy}} as [[Warren Worthington II (Earth-10005)|Warren Worthington II]]\n* {{WP|Shohreh Aghdashloo}} as [[Kavita Rao (Earth-10005)|Dr. Kavita Rao]]\n* {{WP|Josef Sommer}} as the President of the United States\n* {{WP|Bill Duke}} as [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-10005)|Bolivar Trask]]\n* {{WP|Daniel Cudmore}} as [[Peter Rasputin (Earth-10005)|Colossus / Peter Rasputin]]\n* {{WP|Eric Dane}} as [[James Madrox (Earth-10005)|Multiple Man]]\n\nAdditionally, Adrian Hough and Desiree Zurowski portray [[John Grey (Earth-10005)|Mr. Grey]] and [[Elaine Grey (Earth-10005)|Mrs. Grey]], respectively.

He was joined by ''X2'' screenwriters [[Dan Harris]]  and [[Michael Dougherty]],  composer/editor John Ottman, and cast member {{WP|James Marsden}}.  Among the choices for replacements were {{WP|Darren Aronofsky}}, [[Joss Whedon]], {{WP|Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman}}, {{WP|Alex Proyas}}, and {{WP|Zack Snyder}}.\n\n* In March 2005, Matthew Vaughn was hired as the new director for the project. He cast {{WP|Kelsey Grammer}}  as [[Henry McCoy (Earth-10005)|Beast / Dr. Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]], {{WP|Dania Ramirez}} as [[Callisto (Earth-10005)|Callisto]] and {{WP|Vinnie Jones}}  as [[Cain Marko (Earth-10005)|Juggernaut / Cain Marko]], but family issues reportedly led him to withdraw before shooting began.

Both of whom signed two-film contracts. However, Hu's character was killed by Wolverine in the previous film and Alan Cumming was reportedly uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the Nightcrawler makeup. The part for Nightcrawler was so minimal in the third film that he felt it was not worth it to go through the long and costly makeup process when he was barely in the film, and the character was cut.<ref name=\"Screen Rant\">{{Cite web | title=X-Men 3: Why Nightcrawler Didn't Return For The Last Stand | publisher=Screen Rant | work=screenrant.com | url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-last-stand-nightcrawler-return-makeup-cummings/ | accessdate=14 March 2023 | date=November 21, 2020 | author=Kristen Abernathy}}</ref> He did agree, however, to do voice work for the character for the video game based on the film. {{WP|James Marsden}} did appear in the film as [[Scott Summers (Earth-10005)|Cyclops / Scott Summers]], despite reported scheduling conflicts with ''Superman Returns''.\n\n* {{WP|Halle Berry}} stated during interviews for ''X2'' that she would not return as [[Ororo Munroe  (Earth-10005)|Storm]] in the third film unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic-book version.

Whereas in the film, the Phoenix is Jean Grey's evil \"split personality\", in the comics, the [[Phoenix Force|Phoenix]] is a fiery, Phoenix-like alien entity and force of nature that bonds with Jean.  The cure for mutant powers can be seen in Joss Whedon's 2004 \"Gifted\" story arc in ''Astonishing X-Men''.\n\n''X-Men: The Last Stand'' is the first, and so far only, X-Men film to feature the five original X-Men -- Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, Angel, and Jean Grey on the team; however, the characters' backstories and positions within the team are altered. Other characters are translated even more loosely. Many of the Brotherhood shown in the film, for instance, including [[Spike]], Psylocke and Multiple Man, are not Brotherhood villains in the comics. The mutant named Kid Omega resembles a character named [[Maxwell Jordan (Earth-616)|Quill]] in the comics, rather than the hyper-intelligent comic book [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid]]. In the film, [[Psylocke (Earth-10005)|Psylocke]] has a red dagger tattooed above her left eye, and she is able to hide in shadows; this is a reference to a period during which Psylocke was connected to a substance called the \"[[Crimson Dawn]]\", which gives her powers beyond her innate mutant abilities of [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]] that manifests as a psionic knife/[[katana (Earth-616)|katana]]. Brotherhood member Callisto is depicted with superhuman speed and the ability to sense mutants' power levels. In the comics, Callisto is the leader of the [[Morlocks]] and has neither ability, instead, possessing acute senses.  In the comics, Juggernaut is Xavier's human step-brother who acquires power when he finds a mystical stone; in ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', however, Juggernaut is a mutant, and there is no mention of a relationship with the professor. Whereas he is usually gruff and violent in the comics, his line \"Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!\" alludes not to the comics, but to a video (''The Juggernaut Bitch!!'') in which the video's creators talk over footage from {{sl|X-Men: The Animated Series}}.\n\nFamiliar details from the X-Men mythos permeate the film. The X-Men are shown training in the trademark [[Danger Room]], a training complex within the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]]. A giant, mutant-hunting [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] robot appears as a hologram inside the Danger Room. The [[Glossary:Fastball Special|fastball special]], in which Colossus throws Wolverine toward an opponent, appears in the film twice, the targets being Magneto and a Sentinel. Beast's line \"Oh my stars and garters!\" appears frequently in the comics. One of the president's advisers is named Trask, an allusion to [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]], creator of the Sentinels. Kitty Pryde's run through the pharmaceutical complex while being chased by the Juggernaut mirrors the character's similar fight against an alien in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 143}}. Finally, Wolverine's killing Jean bears some similarity when he killed his love [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]] at her request to spare her a painful death from poison (see {{cl|Wolverine Vol 2 57}}), as well as in ''New X-Men'', in which he kills Jean to spare her from a more agonizing death burning up in the Sun.}} \n\n==Adaptations==\n===Novelization===\nThe novelization of the film, written by comic book writer Chris Claremont, was released on May 16, 2006.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=0345492110 | title=[[X-Men: The Last Stand#Novelization|X-Men: The Last Stand]] | publisher=Del Rey | last=Claremont | first=Chris | authorlink=Chris Claremont}}</ref>  The novelization of the movie differs significantly from the film. \n\n{{Navigation\n| title = Difference between Movie and Novelization\n| body  = In the novel, young Jean Grey discovers her powers after an accident that takes her best friend's life. Angel officially joins the X-Men and travels with them to Alcatraz Island instead of going on his own. Storm spares Callisto's life, which is more in line with Professor Xavier's views on violence. Rogue decides to keep her powers in the end, and Beast stays at the school as a teacher. Iceman takes an unconscious Pyro away from Alcatraz. The attack on Alcatraz is referred to as M-Day, a reference to the \"[[Decimation |Decimation of mutantkind]]\" storyline in the comic books. Moira MacTaggert visits Magneto in the park, presumably offering an antidote to the cure, which he refuses because as the book says: \"He couldn't go back. That path had brought nothing but grief, to those he cared for, those who trusted him, to himself. This was better.\" This suggests that in the novel Magneto turns over a new leaf before discovering a slight return of his powers. Unlike the film, the novel does not allude to Xavier's resurrection.}} \n==Gallery==\n====Logos====\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nX-Men The Last Stand logo 001.png\nX-Men The Last Stand logo 002.png\nX-Men The Last Stand logo 003.png\n</gallery> \n====Posters====\n<gallery position=\"center\">\nX-Men Last Stand Poster.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Poster 0002.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Character Poster.jpg\nAngel X-Men 3 Poster.jpg\nX-Men 3 Character Poster Beast.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Poster 0003.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Poster 004.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Poster 005.jpg\nX-Men Last Stand Poster 006.jpg\n</gallery>\n| Links                   =\n* [[Marvel Films#Theatrically Released Films|Marvel Films]]\n* [[X-Men: The Official Game]]\n\n}} \n<!--Split film/book article intentional - Please do not remove this comment-->\n\n[[Category:Fastball Special/Appearances]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox]]"
