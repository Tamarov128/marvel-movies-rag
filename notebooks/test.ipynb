According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark began. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life ... That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\" Joe Russo said that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and was the most defiant of the Avengers: \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...]\n",

Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" The Endgame trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\", and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\" The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours and was the most-viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of Avengers: Infinity War (230 million views).

      "According to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The First Avenger. While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios, Evans said in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the final films on his contract at the time. In November 2018, Joe Russo said that Evans was \"not done yet\" with Captain America after Endgame. In November 2019, when asked if he would reprise the role of Captain America, Evans responded, \"You never say never. I love the character. I don't know,\" and added, \"It's not a hard no, but it's not an eager yes either.\" In January 2021, Evans was reportedly close to signing a deal to reprise the role of Captain America in at least one future project. Evans' involvement was said to be similar to how Downey had supporting roles in other film franchises, such as Civil War, after concluding the Iron Man film\n",

Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in Captain America: Civil War. Watts noted that after Stark's actions in Civil War, introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?\" Co-writer Jonathan Goldstein compared Stark to Ethan Hawke's father character in Boyhood (2014).\n",

You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\" Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie?
